		<h3>
			Update - there is a better map!
		</h3>
		
		On 2017-03-22, Kuururi Ahojanen from Himawari Design in Japan made a new map. It's much better. Please use his.

		<h3>
			Timetable
		</h3>
		
		I'm also working on a timetable app. It's hardly finished, but here's a link anyway.

		<h3>
			What is the TRA map?
		</h3>

		A subway-style "schematic" map of the railway network in Taiwan. 
		
		<br>
			The distance between each station is proportional to the maximum time between the stations. 
		</br>

		<br>
			Express train stops, transfer stations, HSR and MRT connections are all shown. 
		</br>
		
		HSR shuttle bus routes are also shown when those connect with TRA stations. 


		<h3>
			Why did you make it?
		</h3>
		
		The existing map on the TRA website sucks. Only one region is shown at a time, and it is not bilingual. 
				
		<br>
			I tried to go to Inland Rock music festival in Nantou. I stayed with friends in Taichung, and planned
		</br> 
			which trains to take from there. But they dropped me in Fengyuan, and I missed the train I wanted. 
		<br>
			I asked someone on the train: "Does this train go to Ershui?". She said yes. I didn't realise the mistake
		</br> 
			until I got to Taichung Port. I missed the concert and the charter bus back to Kaohsiung. I also had to pay
		<br>
			for a new bus ticket to get home. The total cost of the mistake was over 1600 NTD. I was not happy. 
		</br> 

		<h3>
			How did you make it?
		</h3>
		
		I wrote a new program called <a href="/programs/turtleSheet/index.html" target=_blank>TurtleSheet</a> to draw graphics using data from a spreadsheet. 
		
		<br>The drawing process can be controlled using JavaScript, which is very powerful.</br>
		
		I imported the data from <a href="traMapData.txt" target=_blank>this file</a>. I modified the data heavily during the process to add corners, colours and branch lines. 
		
		<br>I copy-pasted this data into the Import Area, and clicked the Import button.</br> 
		
		Then I wrote a simple JavaScript <a href="traParser.js" target=_blank>program</a> to go through the data and make labels and circles. 
		
		<br>Finally, I did a print-to-PDF, cropped the picture, and saved it as a JPG. </br>

		<h3>
			Why not just use Photoshop?
		</h3>

		At first, I did. I made a bilingual <a href="TRAGeographicMap.jpg" target=_blank>geographic map</a>. But the stations don't line up. 

		<h3>
			Why do some lines turn and turn back?
		</h3>
		
		The length of the line is proportional to the time the bus takes. If there's no space, the line turns corners. 
		
		<br>
			This is particularly a problem around Liujia. 
		</br>

		<h3>
			What are the license terms?
		</h3>
		
		The map is public domain, and you can use it wherever you want. I hope it helps somebody!
