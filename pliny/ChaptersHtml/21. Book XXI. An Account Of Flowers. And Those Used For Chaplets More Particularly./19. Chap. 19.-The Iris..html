<div2 type="chapter" n="19" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 19.—THE IRIS.</head><p>There is still another distinction, which ought not to beomitted,—the fact, that many of the odoriferous plants never<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>enter into the composition of garlands, the iris <span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and the saliunca, for example, although, both of them, of a most exquisiteodour. In the iris, it is the root<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> only that is held in esteem,it being extensively employed in perfumery and medicine. Theiris of the finest quality is that found in Illyricum,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and inthat country, even, not in the maritime parts of it, but in theforests on the banks of the river Drilon<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> and near Narona.The next best is that of Macedonia,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> the plant being extremelyelongated, white, and thin. The iris of Africa<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> occupies thethird rank, being the largest of them all, and of an extremelybitter taste.</p><p>The iris of Illyricum comprehends two varieties—one ofwhich is the raphanitis, so called from its resemblance to theradish,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> of a somewhat red colour, and superior<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> in quality tothe other, which is known as the "rhizotomus." The bestkind of iris is that which produces sneezing<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> when handled.The stem of this plant is a cubit in length, and erect, the flowerbeing of various colours, like the rainbow, to which circumstance it is indebted for its name. The iris, too, of Pisidia<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>is far from being held in disesteem. Persons<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> who intend taking<pb n="4325" />up the iris, drench the ground about it some three months before with hydromel, as though a sort of atonement offered toappease the earth; with the point of a sword, too, they tracethree circles round it, and the moment they gather it, they liftit up towards the heavens.</p><p>The iris is a plant of a caustic nature, and when handled, itcauses blisters like burns to rise. It is a point particularlyrecommended, that those who gather it should be in a state ofchastity. The root, not only when dried,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> but while still inthe ground, is very quickly attacked by worms. In formertimes, it was Leucas and Elis that supplied us with the bestoil<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> of iris, for there it has long been cultivated; at the presentday, however, the best comes from Pamphylia, though that ofCilicia and the northern climates is held in high esteem.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">For some superstitious reason, in all probability.
