<div2 type="chapter" n="40" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 40. (39.)—SLAVES FOR WHICH A HIGH PRICE HAS BEEN GIVEN.</head><p>The highest price ever given for a man born in slavery, sofar as I am able to discover, was that paid for Daphnus, thegrammarian, who was sold by Natius of Pisaurum<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> to M.Scaurus, the first man in the state, for seven hundred thousand sesterces.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> In our day, no doubt, comic actors havefetched a higher price, but then they were purchasing their ownfreedom. In the time of our ancestors, Roscius, the actor,gained five hundred thousand sesterces annually. Perhaps,too, a person might in the present instance refer to the case of<pb n="2186" />the army commissary<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> in the Armenian war, which was of lateyears undertaken in favour of Tiridates; which officer, in ourown time, received his manumission from Nero for the sum ofthirteen million sesterces;<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> but, in this case, the considerationwas the profit to be derived from the war,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> and it was notthe value of the man that was paid for. And so, too, whenLutorius Priscus bought of Sejanus, the eunuch, Pæzon, for fiftymillion sesterces,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> the price was given, by Hercules! rather togratify the passion of the purchaser, than in commendation ofthe beauty of the slave. Universal sorrow and consternationthen reigning, the public were too much pre-occupied with itto put a stop to a bargain of so scandalous a nature.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Pesaro.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We have the same difficulty in ascertaining the sums here mentioned,as in all former cases. Holland estimates the sum given for Daphnusat 300,700 sesterces, vol. i. p. 175.—B.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Dispensator;" we have an explanation of this term, B. xxxiii. c.13.—B.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Holland estimates the sum paid for the enfranchisement of this manat 120,000 sesterces, vol. i. p. 175.—B.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In his capacity, probably, of contractor for provisions and stores.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Holland estimates the price paid on this occasion at 3,500 sesterces,<hi rend="ital">ubi supra,</hi> thus differing exceedingly from Ajasson's estimate.—B.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Quam quidam injuriam lucri fecit ille mercatus in luctu civitatis,quoniam arguere nulli vacabat." We can see the meaning of this passage,but a literal translation of it, as it stands, is out of the question.</p></body>
