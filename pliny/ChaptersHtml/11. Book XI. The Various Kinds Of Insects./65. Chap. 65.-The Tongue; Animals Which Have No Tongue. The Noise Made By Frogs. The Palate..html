<div2 type="chapter" n="65" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 65.—THE TONGUE; ANIMALS WHICH HAVE NOTONGUE. THE NOISE MADE BY FROGS. THE PALATE.</head><p>The tongue is not similarly formed in all animals. Serpents have a very thin tongue, and three-forked,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> which theyvibrate to and fro: it is of a black colour, and when drawnfrom out of the mouth, of extraordinary length. The tongueof the lizard is two-forked, and covered with hair.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> That ofthe sea-calf also is twofold,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> but with the serpents it is of thethinness of a hair; the other animals employ it to lick theparts around the mouth. Fishes have nearly the whole of thetongue adhering to the palate, while in the crocodile the wholeof it does adhere thereto: but in the aquatic animals the palate,which is fleshy, performs the duty of the tongue as the organof taste. In lions, pards, and all the animals of that class,and in cats as well, the tongue is covered with asperities,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>which overlap each other, and bear a strong resemblance to arasp. Such being its formation, if the animal licks a man's skin,it will wear it away by making it thinner and thinner; forwhich reason it is that the saliva of even a perfectly tameanimal, being thus introduced to the close vicinity of the blood,is apt to bring on madness. Of the tongue of the purple wehave made mention<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> already. With the frog the end of thetongue adheres to the mouth, while the inner part is disjoinedfrom the sides of the gullet; and it is by this means that themales give utterance to their croaking, at the season at which<pb n="3062" />they are known as ololygones.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> This happens at stated periodsof the year, at which the males invite the females for thepurposes of propagation: letting down the lower lip to thesurface of the water, they receive a small portion of it in themouth, and then, by quavering with the tongue, make a gurgling noise, from which the croaking is produced which wehear. In making this noise, the folds of the mouth, becomingdistended, are quite transparent, and the eyes start from thehead and burn again with the effort. Those insects whichhave a sting in the lower part of the body, have teeth, and atongue as well; with bees it is of considerable length, and inthe grasshopper it is very prominent. Those insects which havea fistulous sting in the mouth, have neither tongue nor teeth;while others, again, have a tongue in the interior of the mouth,the ant, for instance. In the elephant the tongue is remarkably broad; and while with all other animals, each accordingto its kind, it is always perfectly at liberty, with man, andhim alone, it is often found so strongly tied down by certainveins, that it becomes necessary to cut them. We find itstated that the pontiff Metellus had a tongue so ill adapted forarticulation, that he is generally supposed to have voluntarilysubmitted to torture for many months, while preparing topronounce the speech which he was about to make on the dedication of the temple of Opifera.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> In most persons thetongue is able to articulate with distinctness at about theseventh year; and many know how to employ it with such remarkable skill, as to be able to imitate the voices of variousbirds and other animals with the greatest exactness. The otheranimals have the sense of taste centred in the fore-part of thetongue; but in man it is situate in the palate as well.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Only two-forked in reality.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is <hi rend="ital">not</hi> covered with hair.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is <hi rend="ital">not</hi> bifurcate.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">These are horny, conical papillæ, the summits of which point back-wards.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. ix. c. 60.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Criers."</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">One of the titles of the goddess Fortuna.</p></body>
