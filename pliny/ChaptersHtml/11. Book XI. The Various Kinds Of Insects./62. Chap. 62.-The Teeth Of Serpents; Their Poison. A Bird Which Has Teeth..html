<div2 type="chapter" n="62" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 62.—THE TEETH OF SERPENTS; THEIR POISON. A BIRDWHICH HAS TEETH.</head><p>The asp also, and other serpents, have similar teeth; but inthe upper jaw, on the right and left, they have two of extremelength, which are perforated with a small tube in the interior,<pb n="3058" />just like the sting of the scorpion, and it is through these thatthey eject their venom. The writers who have made the mostdiligent enquiries on the subject, inform us that this venom isnothing but the gall of the serpent, and that it is conveyedto the mouth by certain veins which run beneath the spine;indeed, there are some who state that there is only one poisonfang, and that being barbed at the end, it is bent backwardswhen the animal has inflicted a bite. Other writers, however,affirm that on such an occasion the fang falls out, as it is veryeasily displaced, but that it soon grows<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> again; this tooth,they say, is thus wanting in the serpents which we seehandled about by persons.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> It is also stated that this fangexists in the tail of the scorpion, and that most of these animalshave no less than three. The teeth of the viper are concealedin the gums: the animal, being provided with a similar venom,exercises the pressure of its fangs for the purpose of instillingthe poison in its bite.</p><p>No winged creatures have teeth, with the sole exception ofthe bat. The camel is the only one among the animals without horns, that has no fore-teeth<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> in the upper jaw. None ofthe horned animals have serrated<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> teeth. Snails, too, haveteeth; a proof of which are the vetches which we find gnawedaway by snails of the very smallest size. To assert that amongmarine animals, those that have shells, and those that arecartilaginous have fore-teeth, and that the sea-urchin has fiveteeth, I am very much surprised how such a notion could havepossibly<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> arisen. With insects the sting supplies the place ofteeth; the ape has teeth just like those in man.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> The elephant<pb n="3059" />has in the interior of the mouth fourteen teeth, adapted forchewing, in addition to those which protrude; in the malethese are curved inwards, but in the female they are straight,and project outwards. The sea-mouse,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> a fish which goes before the balæna, has no teeth at all, but in place of them, theinterior of the mouth is lined with bristles, as well as the tongueand palate. Among the smaller land quadrupeds, the twofore-teeth in each jaw are the longest.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There is always one fang, at least, ready to supply the place of the onein front, if lost by any accident.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Like the jugglers of the East at the present day. But it is verydoubtful whether the poison fang is in <hi rend="ital">all</hi> instances previously extractedfrom the serpents which they handle.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">But the camel, as well as the lama, has an incisive bone, providedwith an incisive tooth on each side, and has canine and molar teeth as well.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">If by this term he means teeth separated from each other, the assertion is incorrect, as in these animals we find the molars separated from thelower incisives by a very considerable space.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier says, as far as the sea-urchin is concerned, very simply, andmerely by looking at it, as its five teeth are very apparent.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The incisors are in number, and very nearly in appearance, like thoseof man. The canines are different in shape, though similar in number.What he says about the elephant, is peculiar to that of India.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. ix. c. 88.</p></body>
