<div2 type="chapter" n="40" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 40. (32.)—THE HELLESPONT AND MYSIA</head><p>The tide of the Hellespont now begins to run with greaterviolence, and the sea beats against the shore, underminingwith its eddies the barriers that stand in its way, until ithas succeeded in separating Asia from Europe. At thisspot is the promontory which we have already mentionedas Trapeza<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>; ten miles distant from which is the city of<pb n="1489" />Abydos<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>, where the straits are only seven stadia wide; thenthe town of Percote<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>; Lampsacus<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, at first called Pityusa;the colony of Parium<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>, which Homer calls by the name ofAdrastia; the town of Priapos<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>; the river Æsepus<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>;Zelia<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>;and then the Propontis<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>, that being the name given tothe tract of sea where it enlarges. We then come to theriver Granicus<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>, and the harbour of Artace<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>, where a townformerly stood. Beyond this is an island which Alexanderjoined to the continent, and upon which is Cyzicus<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>, a cityof the Milesians, which was formerly called Arctonnesos<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>,Dolionis, and Dindymis; above it are the heights ofMount Dindymus<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>. We then come to the towns of Placia,Ariace<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>, and Scylace; in the rear of which places is MountOlympus, known as the "Mysian Olympus," and the city ofOlympena. There are also the rivers Horisius<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> andRhyndacus<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span>, formerly called the Lycus; this last river risesinLake Artynias, near Miletopolis, and receives the Macestos,and many other streams, dividing in its course Asia<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> fromBithynia<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span>.<pb n="1490" /></p><p>This country was at first called by the name of Cronia,after that, Thessalis, and then Malianda and Strymonis. Thepeople of it are by Homer called Halizones<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span>, from the factthat it was a nation begirt by the sea. There was formerlya vast city here, Attussa by name; at present there aretwelve cities in existence; among which is Gordiucome<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span>,otherwise Juliopolis; and, on the coast, Dascylos<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span>. Wethen come to the river Gelbes<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span>; and, in the interior, thetown of Helgas, or Germanicopolis, which has also theother name of Booseœte<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span> Apamea<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span>, now more generallyknown as Myrlea of the Colophonians: the river Etheleusalso. the ancient boundary of Troas, and the commencementof Mysia. Next to this comes the gulf<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span> into which theriver Ascanius flows, the town of Bryllion<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span>, and the riversHylas and Cios, with a town of the same name as the last-mentioned river; it was founded by the Milesians at a placewhich was called Aseania of Phrygia, as an entrepôt for thetrade of the Phrygians who dwelt in the vicinity. We maytherefore look upon this as a not ineligible opportunity formaking further mention of Phrygia.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In C. 33 of the present Book.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Opposite to Sestos, made famous by the loves of Hero and Leander.Aidos, or Avido, a village on the Hellespont, is thought to occupy its site.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called Bergase, according to D'Anville.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Its ruins are still known as Lapsaki.
