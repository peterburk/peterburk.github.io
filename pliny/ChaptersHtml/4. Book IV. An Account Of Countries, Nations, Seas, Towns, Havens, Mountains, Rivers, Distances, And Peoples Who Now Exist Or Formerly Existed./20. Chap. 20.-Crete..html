<div2 type="chapter" n="20" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 20.—CRETE.</head><p>Crete itself lies from east to west, the one side facing thesouth, the other the north, and is known to fame by therenown of its hundred cities. Dosiades says, that it tookits name from the nymph Crete, the daughter of Hesperides<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>;Anaximander, from a king of the Curetes, Philistides of Mallus* * * * *; while Crates says that it was at first called Aëria,and after that Curetis; and some have been of opinionthat it had the name of Macaron<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> from the serenity of itsclimate. In breadth it nowhere exceeds fifty miles, beingwidest about the middle. In length, however, it is full 270miles, and 589 in circumference, forming a bend towardsthe Cretan Sea, which takes its name from it. At itseastern extremity is the Promontory of Sammonium<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>, facingRhodes, while towards the west it throws out that ofCriumetopon<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, in the direction of Cyrene.</p><p>The more remarkable cities of Crete are, Phalasarna, Etæa<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>,Cisamon<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>, Pergamum, Cydonia<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>, Minoium<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>,Apteron<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>, Pantomatrium, Amphimalla<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>, Rhithymna,Panormus, Cytæum, Apollonia, Matium<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>, Heraclea, Miletos,Ampelos, Hierapytna<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>,<pb n="1314" />Lebena<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>, and Hierapolis; and, in the interior, Gortyna<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>, Phæstum, Cnossus<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>, Polyrrenium, Myrina, Lycastus, Rhamnus,Lyctus, Dium<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span>, Asus, Pyloros, Rhytion, Elatos, Pharæ,Holopyxos, Lasos, Eleuthernæ<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span>, Therapnæ, Marathusa, andTylisos; besides some sixty others, of which the memory only exists. The mountains are those of Cadistus<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span>,Ida, Dictynnæus, and Corycus<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span>. This island is distant, atits promontory of Criumetopon, according to Agrippa, fromPhycus<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span>, the promontory of Cyrene, 125 miles; and at Cadistus, from Malea in the Peloponnesus, eighty. From theisland of Carpathos<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span>, at its promontory of Sammonium itlies in a westerly direction, at a distance of sixty miles; thislast-named island is situate between it and Rhodes.</p><p>The other islands in its vicinity, and lying in front of the<pb n="1315" />Peloponnesus, are the two isles known as Corycæ, and thetwo called Mylæ<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span>. On the north side, having Crete on theright, and opposite to Cydonia, is Leuce<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span>, and the two islandsknown as Budroæ<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span>. Opposite to Matium lies Dia<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span>; oppositeto the promontory of Itanum<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span>, Onisia and Leuce; and overagainst Hierapytna, Chrysa and Gaudos<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span>. In the sameneighbourhood, also, are Ophiussa, Butoa, and Aradus; and,after doubling Criumetopon, we come to the three islandsknown as Musagorus. Before the promontory of Sammonium lie the islands of Phocœ, the Platiæ, the Sirnides,Naulochos, Armedon, and Zephyre.</p><p>Belonging to Hellas, but still in the Ægean Sea, we havethe Lichades<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span>, consisting of Scarphia, Coresa, Phocaria,and many others which face Attica, but have no townsupon them, and are consequently of little note. OppositeEleusis, however, is the far-famed Salamis<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span>; before it,Psyttalia<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span>; and, at a distance of five miles from Sunium, theisland of Helene<span id="ref_31"><a href="#note_31">[31]</a></span>. At the same distance from this last isCeos<span id="ref_32"><a href="#note_32">[32]</a></span>, which some of our countrymen have called Cea, andthe Greeks Hydrussa, an island which has been torn awayfrom Eubœa. It was formerly 500 stadia in length; butmore recently four-fifths of it, in the direction of Bœotia, havebeen swallowed up by the sea. The only towns it now has<pb n="1316" />left are Iulis and Carthæa<span id="ref_33"><a href="#note_33">[33]</a></span>; Coresus<span id="ref_34"><a href="#note_34">[34]</a></span> andPœëessa<span id="ref_35"><a href="#note_35">[35]</a></span> haveperished. Varro informs us, that from this place there used tocome a cloth of very fine texture, used for women's dresses.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Dalechamps suggests Hesperus.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The island "of the Blessed."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Capo Salomon.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From the Greek <foreign lang="greek">kriou= me/twpon,</foreign> "the ram's forehead"; now calledCapo Crio.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Also called Elæa. Pococke speaks of it as a promontory calledChaule-burnau.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hardouin calls it Chisamo.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The modern Khania. The quince derived its Latin name, "MalumCydonium," from this district, to which it was indigenous. From itsLatin name it was called <hi rend="ital">melicotone</hi> by the writers of the Elizabethanperiod.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Minolo, according to Hardouin.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The port of Apteron, or Aptera, which Mr. Pashley supposes to bedenoted by the ruins of Palæokastro; he also thinks that its port wasat or near the modern Kalyres.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now La Suda, according to Hardouin, who says that Rhithymna iscalled Retimo; Panormus, Panormo; and Cytæum, Setia.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Supposed by Ansart to have stood in the vicinity of the modern cityof Candia.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Strabo says that it stood on the narrowest part of the island, oppositeMinoa. Vestiges of it have been found at the Kastéle of Hierapetra.Its foundation was ascribed to the Corybantes.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Lionda.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Next to Cnossus in splendour and importance. Mr. Pashley placesits site near the modern Haghius Dheka, the place of the martyrdom ofthe ten Saints, according to tradition, in the Decian persecution.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It has been remarked, that Pliny is mistaken here if he intends toenumerate Cnossus among the towns of the interior of Crete. The onlyremains of this capital of Crete, situate on the north of the island, arethose seen at Makro-Teikho, or the "Long Walls," so called from themasses of Roman brick-work there seen.</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Though an inland town, it probably stood in the vicinity of theheadland or promontory of the same name, which is now called KavoStavro. Many of these names are utterly unknown.</p><p><span id="note_17"><a href="#ref_17">17. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">One of the most important towns of Crete, on the N.W. slope ofMount Ida, about fifty stadia from the port of Astale. Mr. Pashleysays that some remains probably of tills place are still to be seen on ahill near a place called Eletherna, five miles south of the great conventof Arkadhi.</p><p><span id="note_18"><a href="#ref_18">18. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The loftiest point of the mountain-range that traverses the island ofCrete from west to east. Its head is covered with snow. The modernname is Psiloriti, looking down on the plain of Mesara. The word <hi rend="ital">Ida</hi>is supposed to mean a mountain in which mines are worked, and theIdæi Dactyli of Crete were probably among the first workers in iron andbronze. The position of Mount Cadistus, belonging to the range ofWhite Mountains, has been fixed by Hoeck at Cape Spadha, the mostnortherly point of the island. It is thought that Pliny and Solinus arein error in speaking of Cadistus and Dictynnæus as separate peaks,these being, both of them, names of the mountain of which the cape wasformed; the latter name having been given in later times, from theworship and temple there of Dictynna.</p><p><span id="note_19"><a href="#ref_19">19. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Grabusa, the N.W. promontory of Crete.</p><p><span id="note_20"><a href="#ref_20">20. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Ras-al-Sem, or Cape Rasat, in Africa. The distance, accordingto Brotier, is in reality about 225 miles.</p><p><span id="note_21"><a href="#ref_21">21. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Skarpanto.</p><p><span id="note_22"><a href="#ref_22">22. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">According to Hardouin, all of these are mere rocks rather thanislands.</p><p><span id="note_23"><a href="#ref_23">23. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The modern Haghios Theodhoros.</p><p><span id="note_24"><a href="#ref_24">24. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">According to Hoeck, they are now called Turlure.</p><p><span id="note_25"><a href="#ref_25">25. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called Standiu.</p><p><span id="note_26"><a href="#ref_26">26. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Capo Xacro, on the east, though Cape Salomon, further north,has been suggested. In the latter case, the Grandes islands wouldcorrespond with Onisia and Leuce, mentioned by Pliny.</p><p><span id="note_27"><a href="#ref_27">27. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Gaidurognissa. None of the other islands here mentioned seemto have been identified.</p><p><span id="note_28"><a href="#ref_28">28. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Between Eubœa and Locris. They are now called Ponticonesi.</p><p><span id="note_29"><a href="#ref_29">29. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Koluri.

Its ancient name was alsoMacris. Strabo identifies it with the Homeric Cranaë, to which Parisfled with Helen.</p><p><span id="note_32"><a href="#ref_32">32. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Usually called Cea, one of the Cyclades, about thirteen miles S.E. ofSunium. Its modern name is Zea. Iulis was the most important town,and the birth-place of the poets Simonides and Bacchylides, of thesophist Prodicus, the physician Erasistratus, and the Peripateticphilosopher Ariston. Extensive remains of it still exist.</p><p><span id="note_33"><a href="#ref_33">33. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There are considerable remains of this town, called by the inhabit-ants Stais Palais.</p><p><span id="note_34"><a href="#ref_34">34. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or Coresia. It was the harbour of Iulis, to which place we learnfrom Strabo that its inhabitants were transferred.</p><p><span id="note_35"><a href="#ref_35">35. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">On the S.W. side of the island. Its ruins are inconsiderable, butretain their ancient name.</p></body>
