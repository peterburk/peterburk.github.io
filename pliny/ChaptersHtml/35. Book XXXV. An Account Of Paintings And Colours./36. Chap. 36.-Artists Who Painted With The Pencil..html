Allthese were artists of note, but not sufficiently so to detain usby any further details, in our haste to arrive at the luminariesof the art; first among whom shone Apollodorus of Athens,in the ninety-third Olympiad. He was the first to paintobjects as they really appeared; the first too, we may justlysay, to confer glory<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> by the aid of the pencil.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> Of this artistthere is a Priest in Adoration, and an Ajax struck by Lightning,a work to be seen at Pergamus at the present day:before him, there is no painting of any artist now to be seenwhich has the power of rivetting the eye.</p><p>The gates of art being now thrown open by Apollodorus,Zeuxis of Heraclea<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> entered upon the scene, in the fourth yearof the ninety-fifth Olympiad, destined to lead the pencil—forit is of the pencil that we are still speaking—a pencil forwhich there was nothing too arduous, to a very high pitch ofglory. By some writers he is erroneously placed in theeighty-ninth Olympiad, a date that must of necessity be reservedfor Demophilus of Himera and Neseus of Thasos, ofone of whom, it is uncertain which, Zeuxis was the pupil.It was in reference to him that Apollodorus, above-mentioned,wrote a verse to the effect, that Zeuxis had stolen the artfrom others and had taken it all to himself.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> Zeuxis alsoacquired such a vast amount of wealth, that, in a spirit ofostentation, he went so far as to parade himself at Olympiawith his name embroidered on the checked pattern of hisgarments in letters of gold. At a later period, he came to the<pb n="6251" />determination to give away his works, there being no pricehigh enough to pay for them, he said. Thus, for instance,he gave an Alcmena to the people of Agrigentum, and a Panto Archelaüs.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> He also painted a Penelope, in which thepeculiar character of that matron appears to be delineated tothe very life; and a figure of an athlete, with which he wasso highly pleased, that he wrote beneath it the line which hassince become so famous, to the effect that it would be easierto find fault with him than to imitate him.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> His Jupiterseated on the throne, with the other Deities standing aroundhim, is a magnificent production: the same, too, with hisInfant Hercules strangling the Dragons, in presence of Amphitryonand his mother Alcmena, who is struck with horror.Still, however, Zeuxis is generally censured for making theheads and articulations of his figures out of proportion. Andyet, so scrupulously careful was he, that on one occasion, whenhe was about to execute a painting for the people of Agrigentum,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>to be consecrated in the Temple of the LacinianJuno there, he had the young maidens of the place strippedfor examination, and selected five of them, in order to adoptin his picture the most commendable points in the form ofeach. He also painted some monochromes in white.<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span></p><p>The contemporaries and rivals of Zeuxis were Timanthes,Androcydes, Eupompus, and Parrhasius. (10.) This last, itis said, entered into a pictorial contest with Zeuxis, whorepresented some grapes, painted so naturally that the birdsflew towards the spot where the picture was exhibited.Parrhasius, on the other hand, exhibited a curtain, drawn withsuch singular truthfulness, that Zeuxis, elated with thejudgment which had been passed upon his work by the birds,haughtily demanded that the curtain should be drawn aside tolet the picture be seen. Upon finding his mistake, with a greatdegree of ingenuous candour he admitted that he had beensurpassed, for that whereas he himself had only deceived thebirds, Parrhasius had deceived him, an artist.<pb n="6252" /></p><p>There is a story, too, that at a later period, Zeuxis havingpainted a child carrying grapes, the birds came to peck at them;upon which, with a similar degree of candour, he expressedhimself vexed with his work, and exclaimed—" I have surelypainted the grapes better than the child, for if I had fullysucceeded in the last, the birds would have been in fear ofit." Zeuxis executed some figures also in clay,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> the onlyworks of art that were left behind at Ambracia, when FulviusNobilior<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> transported the Muses from that city to Rome. Thereis at Rome a Helena by Zeuxis, in the Porticos of Philippus,<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>and a Marsyas Bound, in the Temple of Concord<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> there.</p><p>Parrhasius of Ephesus also contributed greatly to the progressof painting, being the first to give symmetry to hisfigures, the first to give play and expression to the features,elegance to the hair, and gracefulness to the mouth: indeed,for contour, it is universally admitted by artists that he boreaway the palm. This, in painting, is the very highest pointof skill. To paint substantial bodies and the interior ofobjects is a great thing, no doubt, but at the same time it is apoint in which many have excelled: but to make the extremeoutline of the figure, to give the finishing touches to thepainting in rounding off the contour, this is a point of successin the art which is but rarely attained. For the extremeoutline, to be properly executed, requires to be nicely rounded,and so to terminate as to prove the existence of somethingmore behind it, and thereby disclose that which it also servesto hide.</p><p>Such is the merit conceded to Parrhasius by Antigonus<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>and Xenocrates,<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> who have written on the art of painting;and in this as well as in other points, not only do they admithis excellence, but enlarge upon it in terms of the highestcommendation. There are many pen sketches by him still inexistence, both upon panel and on parchment, from the studyof which, even artists, it is said, may greatly profit.</p><p>Notwithstanding these points of excellence, however, Parrhasiusseems comparatively inferior to himself in giving the<pb n="6253" />proper expression to the middle of the body. In his allegoricalpicture of the People of Athens, he has displayedsingular ingenuity in the treatment of his subject; for inrepresenting it, he had to depict it as at once fickle, choleric,unjust, and versatile; while, again, he had equally to show itsattributes of implacability<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> and clemency, compassionatenessand pride, loftiness and humility, fierceness and timidity—and all these at once. He painted a Theseus also, which wasformerly in the Capitol at Rome, a Naval Commander<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> wearinga cuirass, and, in one picture, now at Rhodes, figures ofMeleager, Hercules, and Perseus. This last painting, thoughit has been thrice struek by lightning, has escaped beingeffaced, a circumstance which tends to augment the admirationwhich it naturally excites. He painted an Archigallus<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span>also, a picture which the Emperor Tiberius greatlyadmired. According to Deculo,<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> that prince had it shut up inhis chamber, the price at which it was valued being sixhundred thousand sesterces.</p><p>Parrhasius also painted a Thracian Nurse, with an Infantin her arms, a Philiscus,<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> a Father Liber<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> attended by Virtue,Two Children, in which we see pourtrayed the careless simplicityof childhood, and a Priest attended by a Boy, with acenser and chaplet. There are also two most noble picturesby him; one of which represents a Runner<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> contending for theprize, completely armed, so naturally depicted that he has allthe appearance of sweating. In the other we see the Runnertaking off his armour, and can fancy that we hear him pantingaloud for breath. His Æneas, Castor, and Pollux, all representedin the same picture, are highly praised; his Telephus also,and his Achilles, Agamemnon, and Ulysses.</p><p>Parrhasius was a most prolific artist, but at the same timethere was no one who enjoyed the glory conferred upon him byhis talent with greater insolence and arrogance. It was in this<pb n="6254" />spirit, that he went so far as to assume certain surnames, andto call himself "Habrodiætus;"<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span> while in some other verseshe declared himself to be the "prince of painters," and assertedthat in him the art had arrived at perfection. But above allthings, it was a boast with him that he had sprung from thelineage of Apollo, and that he had painted his Hercules, apicture now at Lindos, just as he had often seen him in hissleep. It was in this spirit, too, that upon being defeated byTimanthes, at Samos, by a great majority of votes, the subjectof the picture being Ajax and the Award of the Arms,<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span> hedeclared, in the name of his hero, that he felt himself quitedisgraced on thus seeing himself a second time defeated by anunworthy opponent. He painted also some smaller pictures ofan immodest nature, indulging his leisure in such prurientfancies as these.<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span></p><p>As to Timanthes,<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span> he was an artist highly gifted withgenius, and loud have some of the orators<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span> been in their commendationsof his Iphigenia, represented as she stands at thealtar awaiting her doom. Upon the countenance of all present,that of her uncle<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span> in particular, grief was depicted; buthaving already exhausted all the characteristic features ofsorrow, the artist adopted the device of veiling the featuresof the victim's father,<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span> finding himself unable adequately togive expression to his feelings. There are also some otherproofs of his genius, a Sleeping Cyclops, for instance, which hehas painted upon a small panel; but, being desirous to convey anidea of his gigantic stature, he has painted some Satyrs nearhim measuring his thumb with a thyrsus. Indeed, Timanthesis the only one among the artists in whose works there isalways something more implied by the pencil than is expressed,and whose execution, though of the very highest quality, isalways surpassed by the inventiveness of his genius. He hasalso painted the figure of a Hero, a master-piece of skill, inwhich he has carried the art to the very highest pitch of per-<pb n="6255" />fection, in the delineation of the warrior: this last-mentionedwork is now at Rome, in the Temple of Peace.<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span></p><p>It was at this period, too, that Euxinidas had for his pupilAristides,<span id="ref_31"><a href="#note_31">[31]</a></span> who became a most illustrious artist; and thatEupompus instructed Pamphilus, who afterwards became theinstructor of Apelles. There is by Eupompus, a Victor in agymnastic contest, holding a palm. So high was the reputationof this artist, that he established a school of painting, andso divided the art into three styles; whereas till then there hadbeen but two, known respectively as the Helladic<span id="ref_32"><a href="#note_32">[32]</a></span> and theAsiatic. In honour of him, a native of Sicyon by birth, theHelladic school was divided into two, and from this periodthere were three distinct styles recognized, the Ionic, theSicyonian, and the Attic.</p><p>We have, by Pamphilus,<span id="ref_33"><a href="#note_33">[33]</a></span> a picture representing the Allianceand the Battle that was fought at Phlius;<span id="ref_34"><a href="#note_34">[34]</a></span> the Victory<span id="ref_35"><a href="#note_35">[35]</a></span> alsothat was gained by the Athenians, and a representation ofUlysses in his ship. He was a Macedonian by birth, but wasthe first painter who was also skilled in all the other sciences,arithmetic and geometry more particularly, without the aid ofwhich he maintained that the pictorial art could not attainperfection. He gave instruction to no one for a smaller sumthan one talent, at the rate of five hundred denarii perannum,<span id="ref_36"><a href="#note_36">[36]</a></span> and this fee both Apelles and Melanthius paid. Itwas through his influence that, first at Sicyon, and thenthroughout the whole of Greece, all children of free birth weretaught the graphic<span id="ref_37"><a href="#note_37">[37]</a></span> art, or in other words, the art of depictingupon boxwood, before all others; in consequence of which thiscame to be looked upon as the first step in the liberal arts. It<pb n="6256" />is the fact, however, that this art has always been held in highestimation, and cultivated by persons of free birth, and that, at amore recent period, men of rank even began to pursue it; ithaving always been forbidden that slaves should receive instructionin it. Hence it is, that neither in painting nor in thetoreutic<span id="ref_38"><a href="#note_38">[38]</a></span> art has there been any celebrated work executed bya slave.</p><p>In the hundred and seventh Olympiad, flourished Aëtion andTherimachus.<span id="ref_39"><a href="#note_39">[39]</a></span> By the former we have some fine pictures; aFather Liber,<span id="ref_40"><a href="#note_40">[40]</a></span> Tragedy and Comedy, Semiramis from the rankof a slave elevated to the throne, an Old Woman bearingtorches, and a New-made Bride, remarkable for the air ofmodesty with which she is pourtrayed.</p><p>But it was Apelles<span id="ref_41"><a href="#note_41">[41]</a></span> of Cos, in the hundred and twelfthOlympiad, who surpassed all the other painters who eitherpreceded or succeeded him. Single-handed, he contributedmore to painting than all the others together, and even wentso far as to publish some treatises on the principles of the art.The great point of artistic merit with him was his singular charmof gracefulness,<span id="ref_42"><a href="#note_42">[42]</a></span> and this too, though the greatest of painterswere his contemporaries. In admiring their works and bestowinghigh eulogiums upon them, he used to say that therewas still wanting in them that ideal of beauty<span id="ref_43"><a href="#note_43">[43]</a></span> so peculiar tohimself, and known to the Greeks as "Charis;"<span id="ref_44"><a href="#note_44">[44]</a></span> others, he said,had acquired all the other requisites of perfection, but in this onepoint he himself had no equal. He also asserted his claim toanother great point of merit: admiring a picture by Protogenes,which bore evident marks of unbounded laboriousness and themost minute finish, he remarked that in every respect Protogeneswas fully his equal, or perhaps his superior, except inthis, that he himself knew when to take his hand off apicture—a memorable lesson, which teaches us that over-carefulnessmay be productive of bad results. His candour<pb n="6257" />too, was equal to his talent; he acknowledged the superiorityof Melanthius in his grouping, and of Asclepiodorus in theniceness of his measurements, or, in other words, the distancesthat ought to be left between the objects represented.</p><p>A circumstance that happened to him in connection withProtogenes is worthy of notice. The latter was living at Rhodes,when Apelles disembarked there, desirous of seeing the worksof a man whom he had hitherto only known by reputation.Accordingly, he repaired at once to the studio; Protogeneswas not at home, but there happened to be a large panelupon the easel ready for painting, with an old woman whowas left in charge. To his enquiries she made answer, thatProtogenes was not at home, and then asked whom sheshould name as the visitor. "Here he is," was the reply ofApelles, and seizing a brush, he traced with colour upon thepanel an outline of a singularly minute fineness. Upon hisreturn, the old woman mentioned to Protogenes what hadhappened. The artist, it is said, upon remarking the delicacyof the touch, instantly exclaimed that Apelles must have beenthe visitor, for that no other person was capable of executinganything so exquisitely perfect. So saying, he traced withinthe same outline a still finer outline, but with another colour,and then took his departure, with instructions to the womanto show it to the stranger, if he returned, and to let him knowthat this was the person whom he had come to see. It happenedas he anticipated; Apelles returned, and vexed at findinghimself thus surpassed, he took up another colour and split<span id="ref_45"><a href="#note_45">[45]</a></span>both of the outlines, leaving no possibility of anything finer beingexecuted. Upon seeing this, Protogenes admitted that he wasdefeated, and at once flew to the harbour to look for his guest.<pb n="6258" />He thought proper, too, to transmit the panel to posterity, justas it was, and it always continued to be held in the highestadmiration by all, artists in particular. I am told that it wasburnt in the first fire which took place at Cæsar's palace onthe Palatine Hill; but in former times I have often stoppedto admire it. Upon its vast surface it contained nothingwhatever except the three outlines, so remarkably fine as toescape the sight: among the most elaborate works of numerousother artists it had all the appearance of a blank space; andyet by that very fact it attracted the notice of every one, andwas held in higher estimation than any other painting there.</p><p>It was a custom with Apelles, to which he most tenaciouslyadhered, never to let any day pass, however busy he might be,without exercising himself by tracing some outline or other; apractice which has now passed into a proverb.<span id="ref_46"><a href="#note_46">[46]</a></span> It was alsoa practice with him, when he had completed a work, to exhibitit to the view of the passers-by in some exposed place;<span id="ref_47"><a href="#note_47">[47]</a></span> whilehe himself, concealed behind the picture, would listen to thecriticisms that were passed upon it; it being his opinion thatthe judgment of the public was preferable to his own, as beingthe more discerning of the two. It was under these circumstances,they say, that he was censured by a shoemaker forhaving represented the shoes with one shoe-string too little.The next day, the shoemaker, quite proud at seeing the formererror corrected, thanks to his advice, began to criticize theleg; upon which Apelles, full of indignation, popped his headout, and reminded him that a shoemaker should give no opinionbeyond the shoes, a piece of advice which has equally passed intoa proverbial saying.<span id="ref_48"><a href="#note_48">[48]</a></span> In fact, Apelles was a person of greatamenity of manners, a circumstance which rendered him particularlyagreeable to Alexander the Great, who would oftencome to his studio. He had forbidden himself, by public edict,as already stated,<span id="ref_49"><a href="#note_49">[49]</a></span> to be represented by any other artist. Onone occasion, however, when the prince was in his studio,talking a great deal about painting without knowing anythingabout it, Apelles quietly begged that he would quit the sub-<pb n="6259" />ject, telling him that he would get laughed at by the boys whowere there grinding the colours: so great was the influencewhich he rightfully possessed over a monarch, who was otherwiseof an irascible temperament. And yet, irascible as he was,Alexander conferred upon him a very signal mark of the highestimation in which he held him; for having, in his admirationof her extraordinary beauty, engaged Apelles to paintPancaste undraped,<span id="ref_50"><a href="#note_50">[50]</a></span> the most beloved of all his concubines,the artist while so engaged, fell in love with her; upon which,Alexander, perceiving this to be the case, made him a presentof her, thus showing himself, though a great king in courage,a still greater one in self-command, this action redounding noless to his honour than any of his victories. For in thus conqueringhimself, not only did he sacrifice his passions infavour of the artist, but even his affections as well; uninfluenced,too, by the feelings which must have possessed his favouritein thus passing at once from the arms of a monarch tothose of a painter. Some persons are of opinion that Pancastewas the model of Apelles in his painting of Venus Anadyomene.<span id="ref_51"><a href="#note_51">[51]</a></span></p><p>It was Apelles too, who, courteous even to his rivals, firstestablished the reputation of Protogenes at Rhodes. Held ashe was in little estimation by his own fellow-countrymen,a thing that generally<span id="ref_52"><a href="#note_52">[52]</a></span> is the case, Apelles enquired of himwhat price he set upon certain finished works of his, whichhe had on hand. Upon Protogenes mentioning some verytrifling sum or other, Apelles made him an offer of fifty talents,and then circulated a report that he was buying these worksin order to sell them as his own. By this contrivance, hearoused the Rhodians to a better appreciation of the meritsof their artist, and only consented to leave the pictures withthem upon their offering a still larger price.</p><p>He painted portraits, too, so exactly to the life, that a factwith which we are made acquainted by the writings of Apionthe grammarian seems altogether incredible. One of thosepersons, he says, who divine events by the traits of the fea-<pb n="6260" />tures, and are known as "metoposcopi,"<span id="ref_53"><a href="#note_53">[53]</a></span> was enabled, by anexamination of his portraits, to tell the year of their death,whether past or future, of each person represented. Apelleshad been on bad terms with Ptolemæus in former times, whenthey formed part of the suite of Alexander. After Ptolemæushad become king of Egypt, it so happened that Apolles wasdriven by the violence of a tempest to Alexandria. Upon this,some of his rivals fraudulently suborned a jester, who was attachedto the court, to carry him an invitation to dine with theking. Accordingly, Apelles attended; upon which Ptolemæuswas highly indignant, and, summoning before him his stewards<span id="ref_54"><a href="#note_54">[54]</a></span>of the household, requested that the artist would point out theone that had given him the invitation. Thus challenged,Apelles seized a piece of quenched charcoal that lay in thefire-place, and traced a likeness upon the wall, with such exactness,that the king, the moment he began it, recognized thefeatures as those of the jester. He also painted a portrait ofKing Antigonus;<span id="ref_55"><a href="#note_55">[55]</a></span> and as that monarch was blind of one eye, heinvented a method of concealing the defect. With this object,he painted him in profile, in order that what in reality waswanting to the person might have the semblance of beingwanting to the picture rather, he making it his care to showthat side of the face only which he could show without anydefect. Among his works, too, there are some figures representingpersons at the point of death; but it is not easy to saywhich of his productions are of the highest order of excellence.</p><p>His Venus Rising from the Sea, known as the Venus Anadyomene,<span id="ref_56"><a href="#note_56">[56]</a></span>was consecrated by the late Emperor Augustus in theTemple<span id="ref_57"><a href="#note_57">[57]</a></span> of his father<span id="ref_58"><a href="#note_58">[58]</a></span> Cæsar; a work which has been cele-<pb n="6261" />brated in certain Greek lines,<span id="ref_59"><a href="#note_59">[59]</a></span> which, though they have out-lived it, have perpetuated its fame.<span id="ref_60"><a href="#note_60">[60]</a></span> The lower part of thepicture having become damaged, no one could be found torepair it; and thus did the very injury which the picture hadsustained, redound to the glory of the artist. Time, however,and damp at last effaced the painting, and Nero, in his reign,had it replaced by a copy, painted by the hand of Dorotheus.<span id="ref_61"><a href="#note_61">[61]</a></span>Apelles also commenced another Venus for the people of Cos,<span id="ref_62"><a href="#note_62">[62]</a></span>which would have outshone even the former one; but deathinvidiously prevented its completion, nor could any one befound to complete the work in conformity with the sketches ofthe outline. He painted also, in the Temple of Diana atEphesus, Alexander the Great wielding the Thunderbolts, apicture for which he received twenty talents of gold. Thefingers have all the appearance of projecting from the surface,and the lightning seems to be darting from the picture.And then, too, let the reader bear in mind that all these workswere executed by the aid of four<span id="ref_63"><a href="#note_63">[63]</a></span> colours only. The pricepaid in golden coin for this picture was ascertained by weight,<span id="ref_64"><a href="#note_64">[64]</a></span>there being no specific sum agreed upon.</p><p>He also painted a Procession of the Megabyzus,<span id="ref_65"><a href="#note_65">[65]</a></span> the priestof Diana at Ephesus; and a Clitus<span id="ref_66"><a href="#note_66">[66]</a></span> on Horseback, hastening to the combat, his Armour-bearer handing him his helmetat his command. How many times he painted Alexander andPhilip, it would be quite superfluous to attempt to enumerate.At Samos, there is a Habron<span id="ref_67"><a href="#note_67">[67]</a></span> by him, that is greatly admired;at Rhodes a Menander,<span id="ref_68"><a href="#note_68">[68]</a></span> king of Caria, and an Ancæus;<span id="ref_69"><a href="#note_69">[69]</a></span> at<pb n="6262" />Alexandria, a Gorgosthenes, the Tragedian; and at Rome, a Castorand Pollux, with figures of Victory and Alexander the Great,and an emblematical figure of War with her hands tied behindher, and Alexander seated in a triumphal car; both ofwhich pictures the late Emperor Augustus, with a great degreeof moderation<span id="ref_70"><a href="#note_70">[70]</a></span> and good taste, consecrated in the most frequentedparts of his Forum: the Emperor Claudius, however,thought it advisable to efface the head of Alexander in bothpictures, and substitute likenesses of his predecessor Augustus.It is by his hand too, it is generally supposed, that the Hercules,with the face averted, now in the Temple of Anna,<span id="ref_71"><a href="#note_71">[71]</a></span> waspainted; a picture in which, one of the greatest difficulties inthe art, the face, though hidden, may be said to be seen ratherthan left to the imagination. He also painted a figure of anaked<span id="ref_72"><a href="#note_72">[72]</a></span> Hero,<span id="ref_73"><a href="#note_73">[73]</a></span> a picture in which he has challenged Natureherself.</p><p>There exists too, or did exist, a Horse that was painted byhim for a pictorial contest; as to the merits of which, Apellesappealed from the judgment of his fellow-men to that of thedumb quadrupeds. For, finding that by their intrigues hisrivals were likely to get the better of him, he had some horsesbrought, and the picture of each artist successively shown tothem. Accordingly, it was only at the sight of the horsepainted by Apelles that they began to neigh; a thing that hasalways been the case since, whenever this test of his artisticskill has been employed. He also painted a Neoptolemus<span id="ref_74"><a href="#note_74">[74]</a></span> onhorse-back, fighting with the Persians; an Archeläus,<span id="ref_75"><a href="#note_75">[75]</a></span> withhis Wife and Daughter; and an Antigonus on foot, with a<pb n="6263" />cuirass on, and his horse led by his side. Connoisseurs in theart give the preference, before all other works of his, to hispaintings of King Archeläus on horseback, and of Dianain the midst of a throng of Virgins performing a sacrifice;a work in which he would appear to have surpassedthe lines<span id="ref_76"><a href="#note_76">[76]</a></span> of Homer descriptive of the same subject. Healso portrayed some things, which in reality do not admitof being portrayed—thunder, lightning, and thunderbolts, inpictures which are known by the respective names of Bronte,Astrape, and Ceraunobolia.</p><p>His inventions, too, in the art of painting, have been highlyserviceable to others; but one thing there was in which no onecould imitate him. When his works were finished, he used tocover them with a black varnish, of such remarkable thinness,that while by the reflection it gave more vivacity to the colours,and preserved them from the contact of dust and dirt, itsexistence could only be detected by a person when close enoughto touch it.<span id="ref_77"><a href="#note_77">[77]</a></span> In addition to this, there was also this othergreat advantage attending it: the brightness of the colourswas softened thereby, and harmonized to the sight, looking asthough they had been viewed from a distance, and through amedium of specular-stone;<span id="ref_78"><a href="#note_78">[78]</a></span> the contrivance, by some indescribablemeans, giving a sombreness to colours which would otherwisehave been too florid.</p><p>One of the contemporaries of Apelles was Aristides<span id="ref_79"><a href="#note_79">[79]</a></span> ofThebes; the first of all the painters to give full expression tothe mind<span id="ref_80"><a href="#note_80">[80]</a></span> and passions of man, known to the Greeks us <foreign lang="greek">h)/qh</foreign>,as well as to the mental perturbations which we experience:he was somewhat harsh, however, in his colours. There is apicture by him of a Captured City, in which is represented aninfant crawling toward the breast of its wounded mother, who,<pb n="6264" />though at the point of death, has all the appearance of beingaware of it, and of being in dread lest the child should suckblood in place of milk from her exhausted breast: this pictureAlexander the Great ordered to be transferred to Pella, hisnative place. Aristides also painted a Battle with the Persians,a picture which contained one hundred figures, for eachof which he was paid at the rate of ten minæ by Mnason, thetyrant of Elatea.<span id="ref_81"><a href="#note_81">[81]</a></span> He also painted Chariots with four horsesin full career; a Suppliant, which almost speaks, Huntsmenwith game; Leontion, the mistress of Epicurus; the Anapauomenc,<span id="ref_82"><a href="#note_82">[82]</a></span>a damsel pining to death from love for her brother;a Father Liber<span id="ref_83"><a href="#note_83">[83]</a></span> also, and an Artamene, two fine pictures nowto be seen in the Temple of Ceres<span id="ref_84"><a href="#note_84">[84]</a></span> at Rome; a Tragedian anda Child, in the Temple of Apollo,<span id="ref_85"><a href="#note_85">[85]</a></span> a picture which has lost itsbeauty, owing to the unskilfulness of the painter to whom M.Junius, the prætor, entrusted the cleaning of it, about theperiod of the Apollinarian Games.<span id="ref_86"><a href="#note_86">[86]</a></span> There was also to beseen, in the Temple of Faith, in the Capitol, a picture of his,representing an Aged Man giving instructions to a Child onthe lyre. He executed also a painting of an Invalid, uponwhich endless encomiums have been lavished. Indeed, so greatwas the excellence of this artist, that King Attalus, it is said,purchased one picture of his at the price of one hundredtalents.</p><p>At the same period<span id="ref_87"><a href="#note_87">[87]</a></span> flourished Protogenes, as already stated.He was a native of Caunus,<span id="ref_88"><a href="#note_88">[88]</a></span> a place held in subjection by theRhodians. Great poverty in his early days, and extremeapplication to his art, were the causes of his comparative unproductiveness.It is not known with certainty from whomhe received his instruction in the art: indeed some say that hewas only a ship-decorator down to his fiftieth year; a proof of<pb n="6265" />which, it is asserted, is the fact, that in decorating the Propylæum<span id="ref_89"><a href="#note_89">[89]</a></span>of the Temple of Minerva, situate in one of the mostcelebrated spots in Athens, where he has painted the fine picture<span id="ref_90"><a href="#note_90">[90]</a></span>of Paralus and Hammonias, known by some as theNausicaa, he has added in the side pieces of the picture, bypainters called "parerga," several small ships of war;<span id="ref_91"><a href="#note_91">[91]</a></span> wishingthereby to show in what department that skill had firstmanifested itself which had thus reached the citadel of Athens,the scene of his glory. Of all his compositions, however, thepalm has been awarded to his Ialysus,<span id="ref_92"><a href="#note_92">[92]</a></span> now at Rome, consecratedin the Temple of Peace there. So long as he was atwork upon it, he lived, it is said, upon nothing but soakedlupines; by which means he at once appeased both hunger andthirst, and avoided all risk of blunting his perception by toodelicate a diet. In order to protect this picture against the effectsof ill-usage and old age, he painted it over four times,<span id="ref_93"><a href="#note_93">[93]</a></span> so thatwhen an upper coat might fail, there would be an under one tosucceed it. There is in this picture the figure of a dog,which was completed in a very remarkable manner, inasmuchas accident had an equal share with design in the execution ofit. The painter was of opinion that he had not given theproper expression to the foam at the mouth of the animal,panting for breath, as it was represented; while, with allother parts of the picture, a thing extremely difficult with him,he was perfectly satisfied. The thing that displeased him was,the evident traces of art in the execution of it, touches whichdid not admit of any diminution, and yet had all the appearanceof being too laboured, the effect produced being far removedfrom his conception of the reality: the foam, in fact,<pb n="6266" />bore the marks of being painted, and not of being the naturalsecretion of the animal's mouth. Vexed and tormentedby this dilemma, it being his wish to depict truth itself, andnot something that only bore a semblance of truth, he effacedit again and again, changed his pencil for another, and yet byno possibility could satisfy himself. At last, quite out of temperwith an art, which, in spite of him, would still obtrudeitself, he dashed his sponge against the vexatious spot; whenbehold: the sponge replaced the colours that it had just removed,exactly in accordance with his utmost wishes, and thus didchance represent Nature in a painting.</p><p>Following his example, Nealces,<span id="ref_94"><a href="#note_94">[94]</a></span> it is said, succeeded inrepresenting the foam at a horse's mouth; for on one occasion,when engaged in painting a man holding in a pair of horsesand soothing them with his voice,<span id="ref_95"><a href="#note_95">[95]</a></span> he also dashed his spongeagainst the picture, with the view of producing a like effect.</p><p>It was on account of this Ialysus, which he was apprehensiveof destroying, that King Demetrius<span id="ref_96"><a href="#note_96">[96]</a></span> forbore to set fire tothe only side of the city of Rhodes by which it was capable ofbeing taken; and thus, in his anxiety to spare a picture, didhe lose his only opportunity of gaining a victory. Thedwelling of Protogenes at this period was situate in a littlegarden in the suburbs, or in other words, in the midst of thecamp of Demetrius. The combats that were taking placemade no difference whatever to the artist, and in no way interruptedhis proceeding with the works which he had commenced;until at last he was summoned before the king, whoenquired how he could have the assurance thus to remain withoutthe walls. "Because I know," was his answer, "that youare waging war with the Rhodians, and not with the arts."Upon this, the king, delighted at having the opportunity ofprotecting the hand which he had thus spared, ordered aguard to be placed at his disposal for the especial purpose ofhis protection. In order, too, that he might not distract theartist's attention by sending for him too often, he would oftengo, an enemy albeit, to pay him a visit, and, abandoning hisaspirations for victory, in the midst of arms and the batteringdown of walls, would attentively examine the compositions of the<pb n="6267" />painter. Even to this day, the story is still attached to thepicture which he was then engaged upon, to the effect, thatProtogenes painted it beneath the sword. It is his Satyr,known as the "Anapauomenos;"<span id="ref_97"><a href="#note_97">[97]</a></span> in whose hand, to mark thesense of security that he felt, the painter has placed a pair ofpipes.</p><p>Protogenes executed also, a Cydippe; a Tlepolemus; aportrait of Philiscus, the tragic poet, in an attitude of meditation;an Athlete; a portrait of King Antigonus, and one ofthe mother of Aristotle.<span id="ref_98"><a href="#note_98">[98]</a></span> It was this philosopher too, whoadvised him to paint the exploits of Alexander the Great, asbeing certain to be held in everlasting remembrance. Theimpulse, however, of his natural disposition, combined with acertain artistic caprice, led him in preference to adopt thevarious subjects which have just been mentioned. His lastworks were representations of Alexander and the god Pan.He also executed some figures in bronze, as already<span id="ref_99"><a href="#note_99">[99]</a></span> stated.</p><p>At the same period also, lived Asclepiodorus,<span id="ref_100"><a href="#note_100">[100]</a></span> who wasgreatly admired by Apelles for his proportions. The tyrantMnason<span id="ref_101"><a href="#note_101">[101]</a></span> paid him, for his picture of the Twelve Gods, at therate of thirty minæ for each divinity. This same Mnason alsopaid Theomnestus twenty minæ for each of his Heroes.</p><p>In addition to these, it is only proper to mention Nicomachus,<span id="ref_102"><a href="#note_102">[102]</a></span>the son and disciple of Aristiæus. He painted a Rape ofProserpina, a picture that was formerly in the Temple ofMinerva in the Capitol, above the shrine of Juventas.<span id="ref_103"><a href="#note_103">[103]</a></span> Anotherpicture of his was to be seen also in the Capitol, placed there bythe Roman general Plancus,<span id="ref_104"><a href="#note_104">[104]</a></span> a Victory soaring aloft in achariot: he was the first painter who represented Ulysseswearing the pileus.<span id="ref_105"><a href="#note_105">[105]</a></span> He painted also an Apollo and Diana;the Mother<span id="ref_106"><a href="#note_106">[106]</a></span> of the Gods seated on a Lion; the fine pictureof the Bacchantes, with Satyrs moving stealthily towards<pb n="6268" />them; and a Scylla, now at Rome in the Temple of Peace.No painter ever worked with greater rapidity than Nicomachus;indeed it is said, that on one occasion having enteredinto an engagement with Aristratus,<span id="ref_107"><a href="#note_107">[107]</a></span> the tyrant of Sicyon, topaint within a given time the monument which he was raisingto the memory of the poet Telestis,<span id="ref_108"><a href="#note_108">[108]</a></span> the artist only arrived afew days before the expiration of the term; upon which, thetyrant was so angry that he threatened to punish him: however, in the few days that were left, Nicomachus, to the admirationof all, completed the work, with equal promptitudeand success. Among his pupils, were his brother Ariston, hisson Aristides, and Philoxenus of Eretria, who painted forKing Cassander a picture representing one of the battles betweenAlexander and Darius, a work which may bear comparison with any.He also painted a picture in grotesque,representing Three Sileni at their revels. Imitating thecelerity of execution displayed by his master, he introduced amore sketchy style of painting, executed in a comparativelyoff-hand manner.<span id="ref_109"><a href="#note_109">[109]</a></span></p><p>To these artists Nicophanes<span id="ref_110"><a href="#note_110">[110]</a></span> has also been added, an elegantand finished painter, to whom for gracefulness few canbe compared, but for a severe and tragic style far inferior toZeuxis or Apelles. Perseus also belongs to this period, a pupil ofApelles, who dedicated to him his work on painting. Aristidesof Thebes had for pupils his sons Niceros and Ariston. Bythe latter of these artists, there is a Satyr crowned with achaplet and holding a goblet: two of his pupils were Antoridesand Euphranor, of the latter of whom we shall have tomake mention again.<span id="ref_111"><a href="#note_111">[111]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He was a native of Thasos, and father and instructor of Polygnotus.As Pliny has already stated that Polygnotus flourished <hi rend="ital">before</hi> the ninetiethOlympiad, there is an inconsistency in his making mention of the son asflourishing before the father.
