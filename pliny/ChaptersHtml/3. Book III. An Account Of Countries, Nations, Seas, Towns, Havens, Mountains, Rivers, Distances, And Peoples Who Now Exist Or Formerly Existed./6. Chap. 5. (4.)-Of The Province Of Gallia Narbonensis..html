<div2 type="chapter" n="5" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 5. (4.)—OF THE PROVINCE OF GALLIA NARBONENSIS.</head><p>That part of the Gallias which is washed by the inland sea<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>is called the province of [Gallia] Narbonensis<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>, havingformerly borne the name of Braccata<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>. It is divided fromItaly by the river Varus<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, and by the range of the Alps, thegreat safeguards of the Roman Empire. From the remainderof Gaul, on the north, it is separated by the mountainsCebenna<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> and Jura<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>. In the cultivation of the soil, themanners and civilization of the inhabitants, and the extent of itswealth, it is surpassed by none of the provinces, and, in short,might be more truthfully described as a part of Italy thanas a province. On the coast we have the district of theSordones<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>, and more inland that of the Consuarani<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>. The<pb n="1175" />rivers are the Tecum and the Vernodubrum<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>. The townsare Illiberis<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>, the scanty remains of what was formerly a greatcity, and Ruscino<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>, a town with Latian rights. We thencome to the river Atax<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>, which flows from the Pyrenees, andpasses through the Rubrensian Lake<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>, the town of NarboMartius, a colony of the tenth legion, twelve miles distantfrom the sea, and the rivers Arauris<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> and Liria<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>. The townsare otherwise but few in number, in consequence of thenumerous lakes<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> which skirt the sea-shore. We have Agatha<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span>,formerly belonging to the Massilians, and the district ofthe Volcæ Tectosages<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span>; and there is the spot where Rhoda<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span>,a Rhodian colony, formerly stood, from which the river takesits name of Rhodanus<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span>; a stream by far the most fertilizingof any in either of the Gallias. Descending from the Alpsand rushing through lake Lemanus<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span>, it carries along with itthe sluggish Arar<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span>, as well as the torrents of the Isara andthe Druentia<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span>, no less rapid than itself. Its two smallermouths are called Libica<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span>, one being the Spanish, and the<pb n="1176" />other the Metapinian mouth; the third and largest is calledthe Massiliotic<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span>. There are some authors who state that therewas formerly a town called Heraclea<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span> at the mouth of theRhodanus or Rhone.</p><p>Beyond this are the Canals<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span> leading out of the Rhone, afamous work of Caius Marius, and still distinguished by hisname; the Lake of Mastramela<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span>, the town of Maritima<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span> of theAvatici, and, above this, the Stony Plains<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span>, memorable for the<pb n="1177" />battles of Hercules; the district of the Anatilii<span id="ref_31"><a href="#note_31">[31]</a></span>, and moreinland, that of the Desuviates<span id="ref_32"><a href="#note_32">[32]</a></span> and the Cavari. Again, closeupon the sea, there is that of the Tricorii<span id="ref_33"><a href="#note_33">[33]</a></span>, and inland, thereare the Tricolli<span id="ref_34"><a href="#note_34">[34]</a></span>, the Vocontii<span id="ref_35"><a href="#note_35">[35]</a></span>, and the Segovellauni, and,after them, the Allobroges<span id="ref_36"><a href="#note_36">[36]</a></span>.</p><p>On the coast is Massilia, a colony of Phocæan<span id="ref_37"><a href="#note_37">[37]</a></span> Greeks,and a federate<span id="ref_38"><a href="#note_38">[38]</a></span> city; we then have the Promontory of Zao<span id="ref_39"><a href="#note_39">[39]</a></span>,the port of Citharista<span id="ref_40"><a href="#note_40">[40]</a></span>, and the district of theCamatullici<span id="ref_41"><a href="#note_41">[41]</a></span>;then the Suelteri<span id="ref_42"><a href="#note_42">[42]</a></span>, and above them the Verrucini<span id="ref_43"><a href="#note_43">[43]</a></span>. Again,<pb n="1178" />on the coast, we find Athenopolis<span id="ref_44"><a href="#note_44">[44]</a></span>, belonging to the Massilians, Forum Julii<span id="ref_45"><a href="#note_45">[45]</a></span> Octavanorum, a colony, which is alsocalled Pacensis and Classica, the river Argenteus<span id="ref_46"><a href="#note_46">[46]</a></span>, whichflows through it, the district of the Oxubii<span id="ref_47"><a href="#note_47">[47]</a></span> and that of theLigauni<span id="ref_48"><a href="#note_48">[48]</a></span>; above whom are the Suetri<span id="ref_49"><a href="#note_49">[49]</a></span>, theQuariates<span id="ref_50"><a href="#note_50">[50]</a></span> and theAdunicates<span id="ref_51"><a href="#note_51">[51]</a></span>. On the coast we have Antipolis<span id="ref_52"><a href="#note_52">[52]</a></span>, a town withLatian rights, the district of the Deciates, and the river Varus,which proceeds from Mount Cema, one of the Alps.</p><p>The colonies in the interior are Arelate Sextanorum<span id="ref_53"><a href="#note_53">[53]</a></span>,Beterræ Septimanorum<span id="ref_54"><a href="#note_54">[54]</a></span>, and Arausio<span id="ref_55"><a href="#note_55">[55]</a></span> Secundanorum;Valentia<span id="ref_56"><a href="#note_56">[56]</a></span> in the territory of the Cavari, and Vienna<span id="ref_57"><a href="#note_57">[57]</a></span>in that ofthe Allobroges. The towns that enjoy Latian rights are AquæSextiæ<span id="ref_58"><a href="#note_58">[58]</a></span> in the territory of the Saluvii, Avenio<span id="ref_59"><a href="#note_59">[59]</a></span> inthat of the<pb n="1179" />Cavari, Apta Julia<span id="ref_60"><a href="#note_60">[60]</a></span> in that of the Volgientes, Alebece<span id="ref_61"><a href="#note_61">[61]</a></span>in thatof the Reii Apollinares, Alba<span id="ref_62"><a href="#note_62">[62]</a></span> in that of the Helvi, andAugusta<span id="ref_63"><a href="#note_63">[63]</a></span> in that of the Tricastini, Anatilia, Aeria<span id="ref_64"><a href="#note_64">[64]</a></span>,the Bormanni<span id="ref_65"><a href="#note_65">[65]</a></span>, the Comaci, Cabellio<span id="ref_66"><a href="#note_66">[66]</a></span>, Carcasum<span id="ref_67"><a href="#note_67">[67]</a></span>in the territory ofthe Volcæ Tectosages, Cessero<span id="ref_68"><a href="#note_68">[68]</a></span>, Carpentoracte<span id="ref_69"><a href="#note_69">[69]</a></span> inthe territory of the Memini, the Cenicenses<span id="ref_70"><a href="#note_70">[70]</a></span>, theCambolectri<span id="ref_71"><a href="#note_71">[71]</a></span>, surnamed the Atlantici, Forum<span id="ref_72"><a href="#note_72">[72]</a></span> Voconi,Glanum Livi<span id="ref_73"><a href="#note_73">[73]</a></span>, theLutevani<span id="ref_74"><a href="#note_74">[74]</a></span>, also called the Foroneronienses<span id="ref_75"><a href="#note_75">[75]</a></span>,Nemausum<span id="ref_76"><a href="#note_76">[76]</a></span> in<pb n="1180" />the territory of the Arecomici, Piscenæ<span id="ref_77"><a href="#note_77">[77]</a></span>, the Ruteni<span id="ref_78"><a href="#note_78">[78]</a></span>, theSanagenses<span id="ref_79"><a href="#note_79">[79]</a></span>, the Tolosani<span id="ref_80"><a href="#note_80">[80]</a></span> in the territory of the Tectosageson the confines of Aquitania, the Tasconi<span id="ref_81"><a href="#note_81">[81]</a></span>, theTarusconienses<span id="ref_82"><a href="#note_82">[82]</a></span>, the Umbranici<span id="ref_83"><a href="#note_83">[83]</a></span>, Vasio<span id="ref_84"><a href="#note_84">[84]</a></span> andLucus Augusti<span id="ref_85"><a href="#note_85">[85]</a></span>, the twocapitals of the federate state of the Vocontii. There are alsonineteen towns of less note, as well as twenty-four belongingto the people of Nemausum. To this list<span id="ref_86"><a href="#note_86">[86]</a></span> the Emperor Galbaadded two tribes dwelling among the Alps, the Avantici<span id="ref_87"><a href="#note_87">[87]</a></span>and the Bodiontici, to whom belongs the town of Dinia<span id="ref_88"><a href="#note_88">[88]</a></span>.According to Agrippa the length of the province of GalliaNarbonensis is 370 miles, and its breadth 248<span id="ref_89"><a href="#note_89">[89]</a></span>.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or Mediterranean.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From the chief city Narbo Martius, and later Narbona, now Narbonne, situate on the river Atax, now Aude. It was made a Romancolony by the Consul Q. Martius B.C. <date value="-118" authname="-118">118</date>, and from himreceived its surname. It was the residence of the Roman governor ofthe province anda place of great commercial importance. There are scarcely any remainsof the ancient city, but some vestiges of the canal, by which it wasconnected with the sea at twelve miles' distance.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From the linen breeches which the inhabitants wore, a fashion whichwas not adopted by the Romans till the time of the Emperors.

Most probably this is the same place that is mentioned byStrabo as Rhoë, in conjunction with the town of Agathe or Agde, andthe Rodanusia of Stephen of Byzantium, who places it in the district ofMassilia or Marseilles.</p><p><span id="note_20"><a href="#ref_20">20. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now the Rhone.</p><p><span id="note_21"><a href="#ref_21">21. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now the Lake of Geneva.</p><p><span id="note_22"><a href="#ref_22">22. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The modern Saone.</p><p><span id="note_23"><a href="#ref_23">23. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now the rivers Isère and Durance.</p><p><span id="note_24"><a href="#ref_24">24. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Most probably from Libici, a town in the south of Gaul, of whichthere are coins in existence, but nothing else seems to be known. Atthe present day there are four mouths of the Rhone, the most westerlyof which is called the "Dead" Rhone; the next the "Lesser" Rhone;the third the "Old" Rhone; and the fourth simply the Rhone. D'Anvilleconsiders the "Lesser" Rhone to have been the "Spanish" mouthof the ancients. In consequence of the overflowings of this river there isgreat confusion upon this subject.</p><p><span id="note_25"><a href="#ref_25">25. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This mouth of the Rhone was much used by the Massilians for thepurposes of commerce with the interior of Gaul, and the carriage of thesupplies of tin which they obtained thence.</p><p><span id="note_26"><a href="#ref_26">26. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The manner in which Pliny here expresses himself shows that hedoubts the fact of such a place having even existed; it is mentioned bynone of the preceding geographers, and of those who followed him Stephenof Byzantium is the only one who notices it. An inscription was foundhowever in the reign of Charles V. of France, in which it was stated thatAtaulphus, king of the Visigoths, selected Heraclea as his place of residence. On the faith of this inscription, Spon and Ducange have placedHeraclea at the modern Saint-Gilles, and other writers at Saint-Remy,where the inscription was found. Unfortunately, however, Messrs. Devicand Vaissette, in their "History of Languedoc," have proved that thisinscription is of spurious origin.</p><p><span id="note_27"><a href="#ref_27">27. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The "Fossæ Marianæ" are also mentioned by Ptolemy and Solinus;though they differ in the situation which they have respectively assignedthem. They were formed by Marius when advancing to dispute thepassage of the Rhone with the Cimbri, who had quitted Spain for thepurpose of passing the Pyrenees and invading Italy, in the year B.C. <date value="-102" authname="-102">102</date>.There is considerable difficulty in determining their position, but theyare supposed to have commenced at the place now called the Camp ofMarius, and to have terminated at the eastern mouth of the Rhone nearthe present Arles.</p><p><span id="note_28"><a href="#ref_28">28. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny is the first who mentions the name of this lake, thoughprevious writers had indicated its existence. Strabo informs us thatabovethe mouth of the Rhone there is a large lake that communicates with thesea, and abounds in fish and oysters. Brotier and D'Anville identify itwith the present lake of Martigues or of Berre.</p><p><span id="note_29"><a href="#ref_29">29. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">D'Anville takes this place to be the present town of Martigues;Brotier thinks that it was situate on the spot now called Le Capd'Œil, nearthe town of Saint-Chamas; and Bouche, the historian of the Province,places it at Marignane, on the east side of the lake already mentioned.</p><p><span id="note_30"><a href="#ref_30">30. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Campi Lapidei," called by the natives at the present day "LaCrau;"probably from the same Celtic root as our word "Crags;" though Bochartderives it from the Hebrew. Æschylus and Hyginus speak of thiscombat of Hercules, and Mela relates that being engaged in a mortalstrugglewith Albion and Geryon, the sons of Neptune, he invoked the aid ofJupiter, on which a shower of stones fell from the heavens and destroyedhis antagonists. Those on this plain are said to be the remains of thestony shower. It is supposed by the scientific that many of these stonesare aërolites, and that tradition has ingeniously adapted this story totheir real origin. The vicinity of Tunbridge Wells presents a somewhatsimilar appearance.</p><p><span id="note_31"><a href="#ref_31">31. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The people probably of the site of the present isle of Camargue.</p><p><span id="note_32"><a href="#ref_32">32. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">They probably inhabited the district south of the Durance, betweenit and the Rhone.</p><p><span id="note_33"><a href="#ref_33">33. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">They inhabited the country in which the present Avignon, Orange,Cavaillon, and perhaps Carpentras are situate.</p><p><span id="note_34"><a href="#ref_34">34. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">They are thought by Hardouin to have dwelt in the vicinity of thepresent town of Talard in the department of the Hautes Alpes.</p><p><span id="note_35"><a href="#ref_35">35. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">They inhabited the eastern part of the departments of the Drôme andthe Vaucluse.</p><p><span id="note_36"><a href="#ref_36">36. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Their territory comprehended the southern part of the departmentof the Ain, the department of the Isère, the canton of Geneva, and partof Savoy.</p><p><span id="note_37"><a href="#ref_37">37. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It was said to have been colonized from Phocæa, a town of Ionia inAsia Minor.
