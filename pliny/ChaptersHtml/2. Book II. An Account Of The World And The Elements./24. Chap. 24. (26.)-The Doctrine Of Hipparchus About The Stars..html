(26.)â€”THE DOCTRINE OF HIPPARCHUS<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> ABOUTTHE STARS.</head><p>This same Hipparchus, who can never be sufficientlycommended, as one who more especially proved the relationof the stars to man, and that our souls are a portion ofheaven, discovered a new star that was produced in his ownage, and, by observing its motions on the day in which itshone, he was led to doubt whether it does not often happen,that those stars have motion which we suppose to be fixed.And the same individual attempted, what might seem presumptuous even in a deity, viz. to number the stars forposterity and to express their relations by appropriate names;having previously devised instruments<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>, by which he mightmark the places and the magnitudes of each individual star.In this way it might be easily discovered, not only whetherthey were destroyed or produced, but whether they changedtheir relative positions, and likewise, whether they were increased or diminished; the heavens being thus left as aninheritance to any one, who might be found competent tocomplete his plan.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">For some account of Hipparchus, see note<hi rend="super">3</hi>, p. 37.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Nothing is known respecting the nature of these instruments, norhave we any means of forming even a conjecture upon the subject.</p></body>
