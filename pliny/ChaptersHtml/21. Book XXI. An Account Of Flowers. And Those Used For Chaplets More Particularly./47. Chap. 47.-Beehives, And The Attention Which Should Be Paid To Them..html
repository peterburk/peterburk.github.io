<div2 type="chapter" n="47" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 47.—BEEHIVES, AND THE ATTENTION WHICH SHOULD BEPAID TO THEM.</head><p>The hives ought to have an aspect due east,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> but never looking towards the north-east or the west. The best hives arethose made of bark, the next best those of fennel-giant, and thenext of osier: many persons, too, have them made of mirror-stone,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> for the purpose of watching<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> the bees at work within.It is the best plan to anoint the hives all over with cow-dung.The lid of the hive should be made to slide from behind, so asto admit of being shut to within, in case the hive should provetoo large or their labours unproductive; for, if this is notdone, the bees are apt to become discouraged and abandontheir work. The slide may then be gradually withdrawn, theincrease of space being imperceptible to the bees as the workprogresses. In winter, too, the hives should be covered withstraw, and subjected to repeated fumigations, with burnt cow-dung more particularly. As this is of kindred<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> origin withthe bees, the smoke produced by it is particularly beneficial inkilling all such insects as may happen to breed there, such asspiders, for instance, moths,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> and wood-worms;<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> while, at thesame time, it stimulates the bees themselves to increased activity. In fact, there is little difficulty in getting rid of thespiders, but to destroy the moths, which are a much greaterplague, a night must be chosen in spring, just when the mallow is ripening, there being no moon, but a clear sky: flam-beaux are then lighted before the hives, upon which the mothsprecipitate themselves in swarms into the flame.<pb n="4345" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Fée remarks here that Pliny is right, and that Columella and Palladius are wrong, who would have the hives to look due north.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Lapis specularis: a sort of talc, probably.
