<div2 type="chapter" n="27" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 27.ÑSIGNS INDICATIVE OF THE PRESENCE OF WATER.</head><p>The following are indications of the presence of water:Ñrushes, reeds, the plant mentioned with reference to this pointalready,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> or frogs sitting squatted on a spot for a long timetogether. As to the wild<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> willow, alder, vitex, reed, and ivy,all of which grow spontaneously on low grounds in whichthere is a settling of rain water from higher localities, considered as indications of the presence of water, they are all<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> ofthem of a deceptive nature. A sign much more to be dependedupon, is a certain misty exhalation, visible from a distancebefore sunrise. The better to observe this, some persons ascendan eminence, and lie flat at full length upon the ground, withthe chin touching the earth. There is also another peculiarmethod of judging upon this point, known only to men ofexperience in these matters: in the very middle of the heatsof summer they select the hottest hours of the day, and observehow the sun's rays are reflected in each spot; and if, notwithstanding the general dryness of the earth, a locality is observedto present a moist appearance, they make no doubt of findingwater there.</p><p>But so intense is the stress upon the eyes in doing this, thatit is very apt to make them ache; to avoid which inconvenience, they have recourse to other modes of testing. They diga hole, for instance, some five feet in depth, and cover it withvessels of unbaked pottery, or with a copper basin well-oiled;they then place a burning lamp on the spot, with an arch-workover it of leaves, and covered with earth on the top. If, after atime, they find the pots wet or broken, the copper covered withmoisture, or the lamp extinguished, but not from want of oil, orif a lock of wool that has been left there is found to be moist,it is a sign of the presence of water, beyond all doubt. Withsome persons it is the practice to light a fire on the spot beforethey dig the hole, a method which renders the experiment withthe vessels still more conclusive.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. xxvi. c. 16.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Salix erratica."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Surely <hi rend="ital">not</hi> the reed, as he has mentioned it above as one of the indications to be depended upon.
