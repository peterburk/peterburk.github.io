<div2 type="chapter" n="48" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 48.—NATURE OF THE WINDS<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>.</head><p>Those are the coldest winds which are said to blow fromthe seven stars, and Corus, which is contiguous to them;these also restrain the others and dispel the clouds. Themoist winds are Africus, and, still more, the Auster of Italy.It is said that, in Pontus, Cæcias attracts the clouds. Thedry winds are Corus and Vulturnus, especially when theyare about to cease blowing. The winds that bring snow areAquilo and Septemtrio; Septemtrio brings hail, and so doesCorus; Auster is sultry, Vulturnus and Zephyrus are warm.These winds are more dry than Subsolanus, and generallythose which blow from the north and west are more dry thanthose which blow from the south and east. Aquilo is themost healthy of them all; Auster is unhealthy, and more sowhen dry; it is colder, perhaps because it is moist. Animalsare supposed to have less appetite for food when this wind isblowing. The Etesiæ generally cease during the night, andspring up at the third hour of the day<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>. In Spain and inAsia these winds have an easterly direction, in Pontus anortherly, and in other places a southerly direction. Theyblow also after the winter solstice, when they are calledOrnithiæ<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>, but they are more gentle and continue only for afew days. There are two winds which change their naturewith their situation; in Africa Auster is attended with aclear sky, while Aquilo collects the clouds<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>. Almost all<pb n="1078" />winds blow in their turn, so that when one ceases its oppositesprings up. When winds which are contiguous succeedeach other, they go from left to right, in the direction of thesun. The fourth day of the moon generally determines theirdirection for the whole of the monthly period<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>. We are ableto sail in opposite directions by means of the same wind, ifwe have the sails properly set; hence it frequently happensthat, in the night, vessels going in different directions runagainst each other. Auster produces higher winds thanAquilo, because the former blows, as it were, from the bottom of thesea, while the latter blows on the surface; it istherefore after south winds that the most mischievous earthquakeshave occurred. Auster is more violent during thenight, Aquilo during the day; winds from the east continuelonger than from the west. The north winds generally ceaseblowing on the odd days, and we observe the prevalence ofthe odd numbers in many other parts of nature; the malewinds are therefore regulated by the odd numbers<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>. Thesun sometimes increases and sometimes restrains winds;when rising and setting it increases them; while, when onthe meridian, it restrains them during the summer. Theyare, therefore, generally lulled during the middle of the dayand of the night, because they are abated either by excessivecold or heat; winds are also lulled by showers. We generally expectthem to come from that quarter where the cloudsopen and allow the clear sky to be seen. Eudoxus<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> supposes that thesame succession of changes occurs in themafter a period of four years, if we observe their minute revolutions;and this applies not only to winds, but to whatever concerns thestate of the weather. He begins his lustrum at the rising of thedog-star, in the intercalary year. So far concerning winds in general.<pb n="1079" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The greatest part of the remarks on the nature of the winds, in thischapter, would appear to be taken from Aristotle's Treatise De Meteor.,and it may be stated generally, that our author has formed his opinionsmore upon those of the Greek writers than upon actual observation.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A.M.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In the last chapter Ornithias is said to be a west wind.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This obviously depends upon the geographical situation of thenorthern parts of Africa, to which the observation more particularlyapplies,with respect to the central part of the Continent and the Mediterranean.See the remarks of Alexandre, in Lemaire, i. 340.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The influence of the fourth day of the moon is referred to by Virgil,Geor. i. 432 <hi rend="ital">et seq.</hi> "Sin ortu quarto," &amp;c.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This refers to the genders of the names of the winds, analogous tothe remark in note<hi rend="super">5</hi>, p. 71.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Eudoxus was a native of Cnidus, distinguished for his knowledge inastrology and science generally; he was a pupil of Plato, and is referredto by many of the ancients; see Hardouin's Index Auctorum, in Lemaire,i. 187, and Enfield's Hist. of Phil. i. 412, with the very copious list ofreferences.</p></body>
