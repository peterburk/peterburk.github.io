The most approvedkinds of the lupus are those which have the name of "lanati,"or "woolly," in consequence of the extreme whiteness andsoftness of the flesh. Of the asellus there are two sorts, thecallarias, which is the smallest, and the bacchus,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> which is onlytaken in deep water, and is hence much preferred to the former.On the other hand, among the varieties of the lupus, those arethe most esteemed which are taken in rivers.<pb n="2400" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The wolf-fish.
