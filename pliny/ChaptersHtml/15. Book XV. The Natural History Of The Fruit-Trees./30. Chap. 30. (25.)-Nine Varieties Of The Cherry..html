(25.)—NINE VARIETIES OF THE CHERRY.</head><p>The cherry did not exist in Italy before the period of thevictory gained over Mithridates by L. Lucullus, in the yearof the City 680. He was the first to introduce this tree fromPontus, and now, in the course of one hundred and twentyyears, it has travelled beyond the Ocean, and arrived in Bri-tannia even. The cherry, as we have already stated,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> in spiteof every care, it has been found impossible to rear in Egypt.Of this fruit, that known as the "Apronian<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> is the reddestvariety, the Lutatian<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> being the blackest, and the Cæcilian<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>perfectly round. The Junian<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> cherry has an agreeable flavour,but only, so to say, when eaten beneath the tree, as they areso remarkably delicate that they will not bear carrying. Thehighest rank, however, has been awarded to the duracinus<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>variety, known in Campania as the "Plinian"<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> cherry, and inBelgica to the Lusitanian<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> cherry, as also to one that growson the banks of the Rhenus. This last kind has a thirdcolour, being a mixture<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> of black, red, and green, and hasalways the appearance of being just on the turn to ripening.It is less than five years since the kind known as the "laurel-cherry" was introduced, of a bitter but not unpleasant flavour,<pb n="3323" />the produce of a graft<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> upon the laurel. The Macedoniancherry grows on a tree that is very small,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> and rarely exceedsthree cubits in height; while the chamæcerasus<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> is still smaller,being but a mere shrub. The cherry is one of the first treesto recompense the cultivator with its yearly growth; it lovescold localities and a site exposed to the north.<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> The fruitare sometimes dried in the sun, and preserved, like olives, incasks.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He must allude to what he has stated in B. xii. c. 3, for he has nowhere said that the cherry will not grow in Egypt.
