<div2 type="chapter" n="41" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 41—CABBAGES; THE SEVERAL VARIETIES OF THEM.</head><p>Cabbage and coleworts, which at the present day are themost highly esteemed of all the garden vegetables, were heldin little repute, I find, among the Greeks; but Cato,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> on theother hand, sings the wondrous praises of the cabbage, themedicinal properties of which we shall duly enlarge<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> uponwhen we come to treat of that subject. Cato distinguishesthree varieties of the cabbage; the first, a plant with leaveswide open, and a large stalk; a second, with crisped leaves, towhich he gives the name of "apiaca;"<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and a third, with athin stalk, and a smooth, tender leaf, which with him ranksthe lowest of all. Cabbages may be sown the whole yearthrough, as we find that they are cut at all periods of the year;the best time, however, for sowing them is at the autumnalequinox, and they are usually transplanted as soon as fiveleaves are visible. In the ensuing spring after the first cutting, the plant yields sprouts, known to us as "cymæ."<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>These sprouts, in fact, are small shoots thrown out from themain stem, of a more delicate and tender quality than thecabbage itself. The exquisite palate, however, of Apicius<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>rejected these sprouts for the table, and his example was followed by the fastidious Drusus Cæsar; who did not escape,however, the censures of his father, Tiberius, for being soover-nice. After the cymæ have made their appearance thecabbage throws out its summer and autumn shoots, and thenits winter ones; after which, a new crop of cymæ is produced,there being no plant so productive as this, until, at last, it isquite exhausted by its extreme fertility. A second time forsowing cabbages is immediately after the vernal equinox, theplants of this growth being transplanted at the end of spring,that they may not run up into sprouts before coming to a top:and a third sowing takes place about the summer solstice, thetransplanting being done in summer if the soil is moist, but,if too dry, in autumn. When moisture and manure are supplied in small quantities, the flavour of the cabbage is all the<pb n="4186" />more agreeable, but when they are supplied in greater abundance, the plants attain a larger size. Asses' dung is the bestadapted for its growth.</p><p>The cabbage, too, is one of those articles so highly esteemedby epicures; for which reason it will not be amiss if we speakof it at somewhat greater length. To obtain plants equallyremarkable for their size and flavour, care must be taken firstof all to sow the seed in ground that has had a couple of turnings up, and then to follow up the shoots as they appear aboveground by moulding them up, care being taken to throw upthe earth over them as they increase in luxuriance, and to letnothing but the summit appear above the surface. This kindis known as the Tritian<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> cabbage: in money and labour itcosts twice as much as any of the others.</p><p>The other varieties of the cabbage<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> are numerous—there isthe Cumanian cabbage, with leaves that lie close to the ground,and a wide, open head; the Aricinian<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> cabbage, too, of nogreater height, but with more numerous leaves and thinner—this last is looked upon as the most useful of them all, forbeneath nearly all of the leaves there are small shoots thrownout, peculiar to this variety. The cabbage, again, of Pompeii<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>is considerably taller, the stalk, which is thin at the root,increasing in thickness as it rises among the leaves, which arefewer in number and narrower; the great merit of this cabbage is its remarkable tenderness, although it is not able tostand the cold. The cabbage of Bruttium,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> on the other hand,thrives all the better for cold; the leaves of it are remarkablylarge, the stalk thin, and the flavour pungent. The leaves,again, of the Sabine<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> cabbage are crisped to such a degree asto excite our surprise, and their thickness is such as to quiteexhaust the stem; in sweetness, however, it is said to surpassall the others.</p><p>There have lately come into fashion the cabbages known asthe "Lacuturres;"<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> they are grown in the valley of Aricia,<pb n="4187" />where there was formerly a lake, now no longer in existence,and a tower which is still standing. The head of this cabbageis very large, and the leaves are almost without number, someof them being round and smooth, and others long and sinewy;indeed, there is no cabbage that runs to a larger head than this,with the sole exception of the Tritian variety, which has ahead sometimes as much as a foot in thickness, and throws outits cymæ the latest of all.</p><p>In all kinds of cabbages, hoar-frost contributes very materially to their sweetness; but it is apt to be productive of considerable injury, if care is not taken to protect the pith bycutting them aslant. Those plants which are intended forseed are never cut.</p><p>There is another kind, again, that is held in peculiar esteem,and which never exceeds the height of an herbaceous plant;it is known by the name of "halmyridia,"<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> from the circumstance of its growing on the sea-shore<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> only. It will keep greenand fresh during a long voyage even, if care is taken not to letit touch the ground from the moment that it is cut, but to putit into oil-vessels lately dried, and then to bung them so asto effectually exclude all air. There are some<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> who are ofopinion, that the plant will come to maturity all the soonerif some sea-weed is laid at the root when it is transplanted,or else as much pounded nitre as can be taken up with threefingers; and others, again, sprinkle the leaves with trefoil seedand nitre pounded together.<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> Nitre, too, preserves the greenness of cabbage when cooked, a result which is equally ensuredby the Apician mode of boiling, or in other words, by steepingthe plants in oil and salt before they are cooked.</p><p>There is a method of grafting vegetables by cutting theshoots and the stalk, and then inserting in the pith the seed<pb n="4188" />of another plant; a plan which has been adopted with the wildcucumber even. There is another kind of wild cabbage, also,the lapsana,<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> which has become famous since the triumphs ofthe late Emperor Julius, in consequence of the songs and jokesof his soldiers more particularly; for in the alternate lines sungby them, they used to reproach him for having made them liveon lapsana at the siege of Dyrrhachium, and to rally him uponthe parsimonious scale on which he was in the habit of recompensing their services. The lapsana is nothing more than awild cyma.<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">De Re Rust. cc. 156, 157.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. xx. c. 33.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "parsley" cabbage, so called from its crisped leaves: the curledcolcwort, or Brassica viridis crispa of C.
