For it was the usage of the citizens to go down inperson to take part in the contests of the Circus, and tosend their slaves and horses thither as well. Hence it is thatwe find it thus written in the laws of the Twelve Tables:<pb n="4307" />"If any person has gained a chaplet himself, or by hismoney,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> let the same be given to him as the reward of hisprowess." There is no doubt that by the words "gained byhis money," the laws meant a chaplet which had been gainedby his slaves or horses. Well then, what was the honour acquiredthereby? It was the right secured by the victor, forhimself and for his parents, after death, to be crowned without fail,while the body was laid out in the house,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and on itsbeing carried<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> to the tomb.</p><p>On other occasions, chaplets were not indiscriminatelyworn, not even those which had been won in the games.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Pecuni‰." FŽe compares this usage with the employment of jockiesat horse-races in England and France.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Intus positus esset."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Foris ferretur."</p></body>
