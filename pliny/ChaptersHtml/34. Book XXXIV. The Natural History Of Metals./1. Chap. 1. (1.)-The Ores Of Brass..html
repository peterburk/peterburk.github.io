The word "®s" does not entirely correspond toour word "brass;" the brass of the moderns being a compound of copperand zinc, while the "®s" of the ancients was mostly composed of copperand tin, and therefore, would be more correctly designated by the word"bronze." But this last term is now so generally appropriated to works ofart, that it would seem preferable to employ in most cases the more generalterms "copper" or "brass." For an excellent account of the "®s" of theancients, see Smith's Dict. Antiq. "®s."ÑB. Mr. Westmacott, in theabove-mentioned article, says that the ancient "®s" has been found,upon analysis, to contain <hi rend="ital">no</hi> zinc, but in nearly every instance to be a mixtureof copper and tin, like our bronze. Beckmann says, on the otherhand, that the mixture of zinc and copper now called "brass," first discoveredby ores, abundant in zinc, <hi rend="ital">was certainly known to the ancients.</hi>"In the course of time, an ore, <hi rend="ital">which must have been calamine,</hi> was addedto copper while melting, to give it a yellow colour." Hist. Inv. Vol. II.pp. 32, 33. <hi rend="ital">Bohn's Edition.</hi> There can be little doubt that the native<hi rend="ital">Cadmia</hi> of Chapter 22 of this Book was our Calamine, hydrosilicate ofzinc, or carbonate of zinc, or else copper ore impregnated with calamine.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. xxxiii. c. 13.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Stipis auctoritas."
