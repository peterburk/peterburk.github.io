<div2 type="chapter" n="6" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 6.—POINTS TO BE OBSERVED IN BUYING LAND.</head><p>First of all, then, I shall proceed in a great measure according to the dicta of the oracles of agriculture; for there is nobranch of practical life in which we find them more numerousor more unerring. And why should we not view in the lightof oracles those precepts which have been tested by the infallibility of time and the truthfulness of experience?</p><p>(5.) To make a beginning, then, with Cato<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>—"The agricul-tural population," says he, "produces the bravest men, themost valiant soldiers,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and a class of citizens the least given ofall to evil designs.—Do not be too eager in buying a farm.—In rural operations never be sparing of your trouble, and, aboveall, when you are purchasing land.—A bad bargain is alwaysa ground for repentance.—Those who are about to purchaseland, should always have an eye more particularly to the waterthere, the roads, and the neighbourhood." Each of thesepoints is susceptible of a very extended explanation, andreplete with undoubted truths. Cato<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> recommends, too, thatan eye should be given to the people in the neighbourhood, tosee how they look: "For where the land is good," says he,"the people will look well-conditioned and healthy."</p><p>Atilius Regulus, the same who was twice consul in thePunic War, used to say<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> that a person should neither buy anunhealthy piece of land in the most fertile locality, nor yet thevery healthiest spot if in a barren country. The salubrity ofland, however, is not always to be judged of from the looks ofthe inhabitants, for those who are well-seasoned are able towithstand the effects of living in pestilent localities even. Andthen, besides, there are some localities that are healthy duringcertain periods of the year only; though, in reality, there isno soil that can be looked upon as really valuable that is nothealthy all the year through. "That<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> is sure to be bad landagainst which its owner has a continual struggle." Catorecommends us before everything, to see that the land which<pb n="4012" />we are about to purchase not only excels in the advantages oflocality, as already stated, but is really good of itself Weshould see, too, he says, that there is an abundance of manuallabour in the neighbourhood, as well as a thriving town; thatthere are either rivers or roads, to facilitate the carriage of theproduce; that the buildings upon the land are substantiallyerected, and that the land itself bears every mark of havingbeen carefully tilled—a point upon which I find that manypersons are greatly mistaken, as they are apt to imagine thatthe negligence of the previous owner is greatly to the purchaser's advantage; while the fact is, that there is nothing moreexpensive than the cultivation of a neglected soil.</p><p>For this reason it is that Cato<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> says that it is best to buyland of a careful proprietor, and that the methods adopted byothers ought not to be hastily rejected—that it is the samewith land as with mankind—however great the proceeds, if atthe same time it is lavish and extravagant, there will be nogreat profits left. Cato looks upon a vineyard as the most<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>profitable investment; and he is far from wrong in that opinion, seeing that he takes such particular care to retrench allsuperfluous expenses. In the second rank he places gardens that have a good supply of water, and with good reason,too, supposing always that they are near a town. The ancientsgave to meadow lands the name of "parata," or lands "alwaysready."<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span></p><p>Cato being asked, on one occasion, what was the most certain source of profit, "Good pasture land," was his answer;upon which, enquiry was made what was the next best. "Prettygood<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> pasture lands," said he—the amount of all which is, thathe looked upon that as the most certain source of incomewhich stands in need of the smallest outlay. This, however,will naturally vary in degree, according to the nature of therespective localities; and the same is the case with the maxim<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>to which he gives utterance, that a good agriculturist must be<pb n="4013" />fond of selling. The same, too, with his remark, that in hisyouth a landowner should begin to plant without delay, butthat he ought not to build until the land is fully brought intocultivation, and then only a little at a time: and that the bestplan is, as the common proverb has it, "To profit by the follyof others;"<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> taking due care, however, that the keeping up ofa farm-house does not entail too much expense. Still, however, those persons are guilty of no falsehood who are in thehabit of saying that a proprietor who is well housed comes allthe oftener to his fields, and that "the master's forehead isof more use than his back."<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">De Re Rust.
