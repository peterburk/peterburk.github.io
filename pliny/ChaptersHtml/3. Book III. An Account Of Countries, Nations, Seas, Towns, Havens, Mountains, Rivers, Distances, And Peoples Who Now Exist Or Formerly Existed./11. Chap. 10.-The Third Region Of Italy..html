<div2 type="chapter" n="10" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 10.—THE THIRD REGION OF ITALY.</head><p>At the Silarus begins the third region of Italy, consistingof the territory of Lucania and Bruttium; here too therehave been no few changes of the population. These districts<pb n="1208" />have been possessed by the Pelasgi, the Œnotrii, the Itali,the Morgetes, the Siculi, and more especially by people whoemigrated from Greece<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>, and, last of all, by the Leucani, apeople sprung from the Samnites, who took possession underthe command of Lucius. We find here the town of Pæstum<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>,which received from the Greeks the name of Posidonia, theGulf of Pæstum<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>, the town of Elea, now known as Velia<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>,and the Promontory of Palinurum<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>, a point at which the landfalls inwards and forms a bay<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>, the distance across which tothe pillar<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> of Rhegium is 100 miles. Next after Palinurumcomes the river Melpes<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>, then the town of Buxentum<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>,called in [Magna] Græcia Pyxus, and the river Laus; therewas formerly a town<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> also of the same name.</p><p>At this spot begins the coast of Bruttium, and we cometo the town of Blanda<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>, the river Batum<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>, Parthenius, aport of the Phocians, the bay of Vibo<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>, the place<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> where<pb n="1209" />Clampetia formerly stood, the town of Temsa<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>, called Temeseby the Greeks, and Terina founded by the people of Crotona<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span>,with the extensive Gulf of Terina; more inland, the town ofConsentia<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span>. Situate upon a peninsula<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> is the river Acheron<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span>, from which the people of Acherontia derive the nameof their town; then Hippo, now called Vibo Valentia,the Port of Hercules<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span>, the river Metaurus<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span>, the town ofTauroentum<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span>, the Port of Orestes, and Medma<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span>. Next, thetown of Scyllæum<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span>, the river Cratæis<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span>, the mother of Scyllait is said; then the Pillar of Rhegium, the Straits of Sicily,and the two promontories which face each other, Cænys<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span> onthe Italian, and Pelorus<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span> on the Sicilian side, the distance between them being twelve stadia. At a distance thence oftwelve miles and a half, we come to Rhegium<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span>, after whichbegins Sila<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span>, a forest of the Apennines, and then the pro-<pb n="1210" />montory of Leucopetra<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span>, at a distance of fifteen miles; afterwhich come the Locri<span id="ref_31"><a href="#note_31">[31]</a></span>, who take their surname from thepromontory of Zephyrium<span id="ref_32"><a href="#note_32">[32]</a></span>, being distant from the riverSilarus 303 miles.</p><p>At this spot ends the first<span id="ref_33"><a href="#note_33">[33]</a></span> great Gulf of Europe; theseas in which bear the following names:—That fromwhich it takes its rise is called the Atlantic, by some theGreat Atlantic, the entrance of which is, by the Greeks,called Porthmos, by us the Straits of Gades. After itsentrance, as far as it washes the coasts of Spain, it is calledthe Hispanian Sea, though some give it the name of theIberian or Balearic<span id="ref_34"><a href="#note_34">[34]</a></span> Sea. Where it faces the province ofGallia Narbonensis it has the name of the Gallic, and afterthat, of the Ligurian, Sea. From Liguria to the island ofSicily, it is called the Tuscan Sea, the same which is calledby some of the Greeks the Notian<span id="ref_35"><a href="#note_35">[35]</a></span>, by others the Tyrrhenian, while many of our people call it the Lower Sea.Beyond Sicily, as far as the country of the Salentini, it isstyled by Polybius the Ausonian Sea. Eratosthenes however gives to the whole expanse that lies between the inletof the ocean and the island of Sardinia, the name of theSardoan Sea; thence to Sicily, the Tyrrhenian; thence toCrete, the Sicilian; and beyond that island, the Cretan Sea.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Græciæ maxime populi." This may also be rendered "a peoplewho mostly emigrated from Greece," in reference to the Siculi or Sici-lans, but the other is probably the correct translation.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A town of Lucania, colonized by the Sybarites about B.C. <date value="-524" authname="-524">524</date>. Inthe time of Augustus it seems to have been principally famous for theexquisite beauty of its roses. Its ruins are extremely magnificent.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now the Golfo di Salerno.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A Greek town founded by the Phocæans.

Castell' a Mare della Brucca stands on its site.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Capo di Palinuro; said to have received its name from Palinurus, the pilot of Æneas, who fell into the sea there and was murderedby the natives.

It was 100 stadia, or about eight miles, from the town,and at it passengers usually embarked for Sicily. The spot is now calledTorre di Carallo.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now the Faraone.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A Greek colony.

Clampetia or Lampetia stood in the vicinityof the modern Amantia. From other authors we find that it was stillexisting at this time. If such is the fact, the meaning will be "the placewhere the former <hi rend="ital">municipal town</hi> of Clampetia stood," it being supposedto have lost in its latter years its municipal privileges.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">One of the ancient Ausonian towns, and afterwards colonized by theÆtolians.
