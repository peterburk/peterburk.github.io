<div2 type="chapter" n="33" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 33.â€”FOREIGN BIRDS WHICH VISIT US; THE QUAIL, THEGLOTTIS, THE CYCHRAMUS, AND THE OTUS.</head><p>Having spoken of the emigration of these birds over sea andland, I cannot allow myself to defer mentioning some otherbirds of smaller size, which have the same natural instinct:although in the case of those which I have already mentioned,their very size and strength would almost seem to invite themto such habits. The quail, which always arrives among useven before the crane, is a small bird, and when it has oncearrived, more generally keeps to the ground than flies aloft.These birds fly also in a similar manner to those I have alreadyspoken of, and not without considerable danger to mariners,when they come near the surface of the earth: for it oftenhappens that they settle on the sails of a ship, and that tooalways in the night: the consequence of which is, that thevessel often sinks. These birds pursue their course along atract of country with certain resting-places. When the southwind is blowing, they will not fly, as that wind is alwayshumid, and apt to weigh them down. Still, however, it is anobject with them to get a breeze to assist them in their flight,the body being so light, and their strength so very limited:hence it is that we hear them make that murmuring noise asthey fly, it being extorted from them by fatigue. It is forthis reason also, that they take to flight more especially when<pb n="2504" />the north wind is blowing, having the ortygometra<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> for theirleader. The first of them that approaches the earth is generally snapped up by the hawk. When they are about to return from these parts, they always invite other birds to jointheir company, and the glottis, otus, and cychramus, yieldingto their persuasions, take their departure along with them.</p><p>The glottis<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> protrudes a tongue of remarkable length, fromwhich circumstance it derives its name: at first it is quitepleased with the journey, and sets out with the greatest ardour;very soon, however, when it begins to feel the fatigues of theflight, it is overtaken by regret, while at the same time it isequally as 10th to return alone, as to accompany the others. Itstravels, however, never last more than a single day, for at thevery first resting-place they come to, it deserts: here too itfinds other birds, which have been left behind in a similarmanner in the preceding year. The same takes place withother birds day after day. The cychramus,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> however, is muchmore persevering, and is quite in a hurry to arrive at the landwhich is its destination: hence it is that it arouses the quailsin the night, and reminds them that they ought to be on theroad.</p><p>The otus is a smaller bird than the horned owl, thoughlarger than the owlet; it has feathers projecting like ears,whence its name. Some persons call it in the Latin languagethe "asio;"<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> in general it is a bird fond of mimicking, a greatparasite, and, in some measure, a dancer as well. Like theowlet, it is taken without any difficulty; for while one personoccupies its attention, another goes behind, and catches it.</p><p>If the wind, by its contrary blasts, should begin to preventthe onward progress of the flight, the birds immediately takeup small stones, or else fill their throats with sand, and socontrive to ballast themselves as they fly. The seeds of acertain venomous plant<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> are most highly esteemed by the<pb n="2505" />quails as food; for which reason it is that they have been banished from our tables; in addition to which, a great repugnanceis manifested to eating their flesh, on account of the epilepsy,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>to which alone of all animals, with the exception of man, thequail is subject.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The "mother of the quails."

Med.B. i., states, that if the bird has eaten hellebore, epilepsy is the consequenceto the person who partakes of its flesh.</p></body>
