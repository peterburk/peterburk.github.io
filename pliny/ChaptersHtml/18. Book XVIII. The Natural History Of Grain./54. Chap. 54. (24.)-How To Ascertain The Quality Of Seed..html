<div2 type="chapter" n="54" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 54. (24.)—HOW TO ASCERTAIN THE QUALITY OF SEED.</head><p>The best seed of all is that which is of the last year's growth.That which is two years old is inferior, and three the worst of all<pb n="4070" />—beyond that, it is unproductive.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> The same definite rulewhich applies to one kind of seed is applicable to them all:the seed which falls to the bottom<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> on the threshing-floor,should be reserved for sowing, for being the most weighty itis the best in quality: there is no better method, in fact, ofascertaining its quality. The grains of those ears which haveintervals between the seed should be rejected. The best grainis that which has a reddish hue,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and which, when brokenbetween the teeth, presents the same<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> colour; that which hasmore white within is of inferior quality. It is a well-knownfact that some lands require more seed than others, from whichcircumstance first arose a superstition that exists among thepeasantry; it is their belief that when the ground demands theseed with greater avidity than usual, it is famished, and devoursthe grain. It is consistent with reason to put in the seedwhere the soil is humid sooner than elsewhere, to prevent thegrain from rotting in the rain: on dry spots it should be sownlater, and just before the fall of a shower, so that it may nothave to lie long without germinating and so come to nothing.When the seed is put in early it should be sown thick, as it isa considerable time before it germinates; but when it is putin later, it should be sown thinly, to prevent it from beingsuffocated. There is a certain degree of skill, too, required inscattering the seed evenly; to ensure this, the hand must keeptime<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> with the step, moving always with the right foot.There are certain persons, also, who have a secret method<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> oftheir own, having been born<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> with a happy hand which impartsfruitfulness to the grain. Care should be taken not tosow seed in a warm locality which has been grown in a cold<pb n="4071" />one, nor should the produce of an early soil be sown in a lateone. Those who give advice to the contrary have quite misapplied their pains.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Sterile."
