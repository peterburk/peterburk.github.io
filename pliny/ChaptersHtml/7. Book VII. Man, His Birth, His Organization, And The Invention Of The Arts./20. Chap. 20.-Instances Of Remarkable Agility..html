We may remark, that a stadium is about one-eighth of a mile, according to which estimate, Philippides must have gone 142 miles in two days, and the other 150miles in one day; as it is implied, that these journeys were performed onfoot, even the former of them is obviously impossible.—B. Query, however, as to this last assertion; according to recent pedestrian feats, it doesnot appear to be absolutely impossible.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. ii. c. 72.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This feat is no less incredible than those mentioned above.—B.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We have an account of this journey of Tiberius in Dion Cassius.Val. Maximus, B. v. c. 6, also enumerates this among the extraordinaryexamples of fraternal affection.—B. We learn also from Suetonius, thaton learning the accident, a fall from his horse, which had happened to hisbrother Drusus, Tiberius took horse at Ticinum, and travelled night andday till he reached his brother, who was then in Germany, near the Rhine.He accompanied the body to Rome, preceding it on foot all the way. Thereis extant a "Consolation to Livia Augusta," written on this occasion, somehave thought, by Pedo Albinovanus, but it is more likely to have been thework of Ovid.</p></body>
