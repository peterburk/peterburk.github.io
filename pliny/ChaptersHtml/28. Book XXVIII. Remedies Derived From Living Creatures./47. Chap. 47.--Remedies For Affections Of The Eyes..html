<div2 type="chapter" n="47" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 47.â€”-REMEDIES FOR AFFECTIONS OF THE EYES.</head><p>For defluxions<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> of the eyes, beef suet, boiled with oil, isapplied to the parts affected; and for eruptions of those organs,ashes of burnt deer's horns are similarly employed, the tips ofthe horns being considered the most effectual for the purpose.For the cure of cataract, it is reckoned a good plan to applya wolf's excrements: the same substance, too, reduced toashes, is used for the dispersion of films, in combination withAttic honey. Bear's gall, too, is similarly employed; and forthe cure of epinyctis, wild boar's lard, mixed with oil ofroses, is thought to be very useful. An ass's hoof, reduced toashes and applied with asses' milk, is used for the removal ofmarks in the eyes and indurations of the crystalline humours.Beef marrow, from the right fore leg, beaten up with soot,is employed for affections of the eyebrows, and for diseasesof the eyelids and corners of the eyes. For the same purpose,also, a sort of calliblepharon<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> is prepared from soot, the bestof all being that made from a wick of papyrus mixed withoil of sesame; the soot being removed with a feather andcaught in a new vessel prepared for the purpose. This mixture, too, is very efficacious for preventing superfluous eyelashes from growing again when once pulled out.</p><p>Bull's gall is made up into eye-salves<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> with white of egg,<pb n="5336" />these salves being steeped in water and applied to the eyes forfour days successively. Veal suet, with goose-grease and theextracted juice of ocimum, is remarkably good for diseases ofthe eye-lids. Veal marrow, with the addition of an equalproportion of wax and oil or oil of roses, an egg being addedto the mixture, is used as a liniment for indurations of the eyelids. Soft goats' milk cheese is used as an application, withwarm water, to allay defluxions of the eyes; but when theyare attended with swelling, honey is used instead of the water.In both cases, however, the eyes should be fomented withwarm whey. In cases of dry ophthalmia, it is found a veryuseful plan to take the muscles<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> lying within a loin of pork,and, after reducing them to ashes, to pound and apply them tothe part affected.</p><p>She-goats, they say, are never affected with ophthalmia,from the circumstance that they browse upon certain kinds ofherbs: the same, too, with the gazelle. Hence it is that wefind it recommended, at the time of new moon, to swallow thedung of these animals, coated with wax. As they are able tosee, too, by night, it is a general belief that the blood of a hegoat is a cure for those persons affected with dimness of sightto whom the Greeks have given the name of "nyctalopes."<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>A similar virtue is attributed to the liver of a she-goat, boiledin astringent wine. Some are in the habit of rubbing the eyeswith the thick gravy<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> which exudes from a she-goat's liverroasted, or with the gall of that animal: they recommend theflesh also as a diet, and say that the patient should exposehis eyes to the fumes of it while boiling: it is a generalopinion, too, that the animal should be of a reddish colour.Another prescription is, to fumigate the eyes with the steamarising from the liver boiled in an earthen jar, or, according tosome authorities, roasted.</p><p>Goats' gall is applied for numerous purposes: with honey,for films upon the eyes; with one-third part of white hellebore,for cataract; with wine, for spots upon the eyes, indurations ofthe cornea, films, webs, and argema; with extracted juiceof cabbage, for diseases of the eyelids, the hairs being firstpulled out, and the preparation left to dry on the parts affected;<pb n="5337" />and with woman's milk, for rupture of the coats of the eye.For all these purposes, the gall is considered the most efficacious, when dried. Nor is the dung of this animal held indisesteem, being applied with honey for defluxions of the eyes.The marrow, too, of a goat, or a hare's lights, we find usedfor pains in the eyes; and the gall of a goat, with raisin wineor honey, for the dispersion of films upon those organs. It isrecommended also, for ophthalmia, to anoint the eyes withwolf's fat or swine's marrow: we find it asserted, too, that persons who carry a wolf's tongue, inserted in a bracelet, willalways be exempt from ophthalmia.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">If they are occasioned by irritation, Ajasson thinks that Pliny's re-medy may he of some utility.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A cosmetic for "beautifying the eye-brows."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Collyria."</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is the translation suggested by Dalechamps for "lumbulis."</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Seers by night."</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Sanie."</p></body>
