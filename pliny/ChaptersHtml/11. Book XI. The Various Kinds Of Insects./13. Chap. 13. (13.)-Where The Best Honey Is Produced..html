(13.)â€”WHERE THE BEST HONEY IS PRODUCED.</head><p>The honey is always best in those countries where it is tobe found deposited in the calix of the most exquisite flowers,such, for instance, as the districts of Hymettus and Hybla,in Attica and Sicily respectively, and after them the island ofCalydna.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> At first, honey is thin, like water, after which iteffervesces for some days, and purifies itself like must. Onthe twentieth day it begins to thicken, and soon after becomescovered with a thin membrane, which gradually increasesthrough the scum which is thrown up by the heat. Thehoney of the very finest flavour, and the least tainted by theleaves of trees, is that gathered from the foliage of the oakand the linden, and from reeds.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. iv. c. 24.</p></body>
