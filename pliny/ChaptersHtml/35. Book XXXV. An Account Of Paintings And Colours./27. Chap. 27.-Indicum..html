Persons who adulterate it,stain pigeons' dung with genuine indicum, or else colour Selinusian<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>earth, or anularian<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> chalk with woad.</p><p>The proper way of testing indicum is by laying it on hotcoals, that which is genuine producing a fine purple flame,and emitting a smell like that of sea-water while it smokes:hence it is that some are of opinion that it is gathered from therocks on the sea-shore. The price of indicum is twenty denariiper pound. Used medicinally, it alleviates cold shiveringsand defluxions, and acts as a desiccative upon sores.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Indigo, no doubt, is the colour meant.

Beckmann and Dr. Bancroft have each investigated thissubject at great length, and though Pliny is greatly mistaken as to the mode in which the drug was produced, they agree in the conclusion thathis "indicum" was real indigo, and not, as some have supposed, a pigmentprepared from <hi rend="ital">isatis,</hi> or woad.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This passage, similar in many respects to the account given by Dioscorides, is commented on at great length by Beckmann, Hist.
