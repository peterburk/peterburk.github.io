<div2 type="chapter" n="17" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 17. (19.)—PUŒNICE.</head><p>We must now return to the coast and to Phœnice. Therewas formerly a town here known as Crocodilon; there is stilla river<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> of that name: Dorum<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and Sycaminon<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> are the names<pb n="1434" />of cities of which the remembrance only exists. We thencome to the Promontory of Carmelus<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, and, upon the mountain,a town<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> of that name, formerly called Acbatana. Nextto this are Getta<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>, Jeba, and the river Pacida, or Belus<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>,which throws up on its narrow banks a kind of sand fromwhich glass<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> is made: this river flows from the marshes ofCendebia, at the foot of Mount Carmelus. Close to thisriver is Ptolemais, formerly called Ace<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>, a colony of ClaudiusCæsar; and then the town of Ecdippa<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>, and the promontoryknown as the White Promontory<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>. We next cometo the city of Tyre<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>, formerly an island, separated fromthe mainland by a channel of the sea, of great depth, 700paces in width, but now joined to it by the works whichwere thrown up by Alexander when besieging it,—theTyre so famous in ancient times for its offspring, the citiesto which it gave birth, Leptis, Utica, and Carthage<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>,—that rival of the Roman sway, that thirsted so eagerly for the<pb n="1435" />conquest of the whole earth; Gades, too, which she foundedbeyond the limits of the world. At the present day, all herfame is confined to the production of the murex and thepurple<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>. Its circumference, including therein Palætyrus<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>, isnineteen miles, the place itself extending twenty-two stadia.The next towns are Sarepta<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> and Ornithon<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span>, and thenSidon<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span>, famous for its manufacture of glass, and the parentof Thebes<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> in Bœotia.</p><p>(20.) In the rear of this spot begins the chain of Libanus,which extends 1500 stadia, as far as Simyra; this districthas the name of Cœle Syria. Opposite to this chain, andseparated from it by an intervening valley, stretches awaythe range of Antilibanus, which was formerly connectedwith Libanus<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> by a wall. Beyond it, and lying in the interior,is the region of Decapolis, and, with it, the Tetrarchiesalready mentioned, and the whole expanse of Palæstina. Onthe coast, again, and lying beneath Libanus, is the riverMagoras<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span>, the colony of Berytus<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span>, which bears the name ofFelix Julia, the town of Leontos<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span>, the river Lycos<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span>, Palæbyblos<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span>,the river Adonis<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span>, and the towns of Byblos<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span>,<pb n="1436" />Botrys<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span>, Gigarta<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span>, Trieris<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span>, Calamos<span id="ref_31"><a href="#note_31">[31]</a></span>, Tripolis<span id="ref_32"><a href="#note_32">[32]</a></span>, inhabitedby the Tyrians, Sidonians, and Aradians; Orthosia<span id="ref_33"><a href="#note_33">[33]</a></span>, theriver Eleutheros<span id="ref_34"><a href="#note_34">[34]</a></span> the towns of Simyra and Marathos<span id="ref_35"><a href="#note_35">[35]</a></span>; andopposite, Arados<span id="ref_36"><a href="#note_36">[36]</a></span>, a town seven stadia long, on an island,distant 200 paces from the mainland. After passingthrough the country in which the before-named mountainsend and the plains that lie between, Mount Bargylus<span id="ref_37"><a href="#note_37">[37]</a></span>is seen to rise.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The town was situate between Cæsarea and Ptolemais. The river has been identified with the modern Nahl-el-Zerka, in which, according to Pococke, crocodiles have been found.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Called Dor, before the conquest of Canaan by the Israelites. See Joshua xvii. 11, and Judges i. 27. It afterwards belonged to the half-tribe of Manasseh. Its site is now called Tortura.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Its site is now called Atlik, according to D'Anville. Parisot suggests that it is the modern Keufah; others that it is Hepha, near Mount Carmel.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Insignificant in height and extent, but celebrated in Scripture history. It still bears the name of Cape Carmel.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is not improbable that he means the town of Porphyrium, now Khaifa, at the foot of the mountain.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably the Gitta of Polybius. Of it and Jeba, nothing is known.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Nahr-Naman, or Abou, on which Ptolemais was situate.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Employed in the extensive manufacture of that article at Tyre and Sidon, to the north of this district.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A corruption of Acco, the native name; from which the English name Acre, and the French St. Jean d'Acre. The earliest mention of it is in the Book of Judges, i. 31. It is supposed that it was Ptolemy I., the son of Lagus, who enlarged it and gave it the name of Ptolemais. Its citadel, however, still retained the name of Ace. Under the Romans, Ptolemais, as mentioned by Pliny, was a colony, and belonged to Galilee. The modern city of Acre occupies its site.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Ach-Zib of Scripture, mentioned in Joshua xix. 29, and Judges I. 31. Its ruins are to be seen near the sea-shore, about three hours' journey north of Acre. The spot is still called Es-Zib.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Still called the Ras-el-Abiad, or White Promontory.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A colony of the Sidonians: its scanty ruins are still to be seen at the poor village of Sur. The wars of the Crusades completed its downfall. The island is still joined to the mainland by the mole which was erected by Alexander the Great during the siege of the place; or, according to some, by the Syrians themselves.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Carthage is supposed to have been colonized <hi rend="ital">immediately</hi> by the people of Utica.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From which was made the famous Tyrian purple.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "ancient Tyre," which was built on the mainland.</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Zarephath of 1 Kings xvii. 9, 10, whither Elijah was sent to the widow, whose son he afterwards raised from the dead. Its site is now known as Sarfand.</p><p><span id="note_17"><a href="#ref_17">17. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably meaning "City of the Birds," perhaps from the quantities of game in its vicinity. Its site now bears the name of Adlan.</p><p><span id="note_18"><a href="#ref_18">18. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Its site is now called Saïda. In the time of David and Solomon, it was probably subject to the kings of Tyre.</p><p><span id="note_19"><a href="#ref_19">19. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cadmus, the founder of Thebes, was said to have been the son of its king Agenor.</p><p><span id="note_20"><a href="#ref_20">20. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Lebanon of Scripture. This intervening space, the ancient Cœle-Syria, is now inhabited by the Druses.</p><p><span id="note_21"><a href="#ref_21">21. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Perhaps the modern Nahr-el-Damur.</p><p><span id="note_22"><a href="#ref_22">22. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Beyrout. By some it has been identified with the Berotha, or Berothai, of the Hebrew Scriptures. Its full name as a Roman colony was, "Colonia Julia Augusta Felix Berytus." It was colonized by the veterans of the Fifth, or Macedonian, and the Eighth, or Augustan, Legions. Beyrout, or Berut, is now, in a commercial point of view, the most important place in Syria.</p><p><span id="note_23"><a href="#ref_23">23. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Nothing is known of this place. The name seems to mean, the "Town of the Lion."</p><p><span id="note_24"><a href="#ref_24">24. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now the Nahr-el-Kelb, or "Dog's River."</p><p><span id="note_25"><a href="#ref_25">25. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The site of this place seems not to be known.</p><p><span id="note_26"><a href="#ref_26">26. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now the Nahr-el-Ibrahim.</p><p><span id="note_27"><a href="#ref_27">27. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The modern town which stands on its site is called Jebeil. It is situate at the foot of Lebanon. The ancient name seems to have been Gebal, and the Geblites are mentioned in Joshua, xiii. 5; 1 Kings, v. 18; and Ezek. xxvii. 9. The ruins of the ancient city are very extensive. Astarte and Isis seem to have been worshipped here.</p><p><span id="note_28"><a href="#ref_28">28. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Batrun, a small town about twelve miles north of Byblus, said to have been founded by Ithobal, king of Tyre.</p><p><span id="note_29"><a href="#ref_29">29. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Gazir, according to D'Anville.</p><p><span id="note_30"><a href="#ref_30">30. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Twelve miles from Tripolis. Its name would seem to bear reference to a trireme, or galley. It has been said that this is the place referred to in the Book of Daniel, xi. 30.</p><p><span id="note_31"><a href="#ref_31">31. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Polybius speaks of this place as being burnt by Antiochus. Its site still bears the name of Calamon, according to D'Anville.</p><p><span id="note_32"><a href="#ref_32">32. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This properly consisted of three distinct cities, 600 feet apart, each with its own walls, but all connected in a common constitution; having one place of assembly, and forming in reality one city only. They were colonies, as here suggested by Pliny, of Tyre, Sidon, and Arados respectively. It is still a considerable place, called Tarabolos, or Tarablis, by the Turks.</p><p><span id="note_33"><a href="#ref_33">33. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Its site is still known as Ortosa, or Tortosa.</p><p><span id="note_34"><a href="#ref_34">34. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably the same as the Nahr-el-Kebir, or "Great River," to the north of Tripolis. It may have derived its Greek name, which signifies "free," from its similarity to that given to it by the people of the country.</p><p><span id="note_35"><a href="#ref_35">35. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This was an important city, near Antarados. Its ruins are spoken of as very extensive. Simyra is still called Sumira.</p><p><span id="note_36"><a href="#ref_36">36. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called Ruad; an island off the northern coast of Phœnicia, at a distance of twenty stadia from the mainland, Pliny falling short here in his measurement. The city of Arados was very populous, though built on a mere rock; and, contrary to Eastern custom, the houses contained many stories. It is spoken of by the prophet Ezekiel under the name of Arvad: see c. xxvii. 8, 11. In importance, it ranked next to the cities of Tyre and Sidon.</p><p><span id="note_37"><a href="#ref_37">37. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Its modern name does not appear to be known.</p></body>
