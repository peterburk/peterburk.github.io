<div2 type="chapter" n="64" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 64.ÑHOW AN ESTIMATE IS FORMED OF THE AGEOF ANIMALS FROM THEIR TEETH.</head><p>The age, in beasts of burden,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> is indicated by the teeth. Inthe horse they are forty in number. At thirty months itloses the two fore-teeth in either jaw, and in the following yearthe same number next to them, at the time that the eye-teeth<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>come. At the beginning of the fifth year the animal loses twoteeth, which grow again in the sixth, and in the seventh it hasall its teeth, those which have replaced the others, and thosewhich have never been changed. If a horse is gelded<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> beforeit changes its teeth, it never sheds them. In a similar manner,also, the ass loses four of its teeth in the thirtieth month, andthe others from six months to six months. If a she-ass happens not to have foaled before the last of these teeth are shed,it is sure to be barren.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> Oxen change their teeth at two yearsold: with swine they are never changed.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>,When theseseveral indications of age have been lost in horses and otherbeasts of burden, the age is ascertained by the projecting ofthe teeth, the greyness of the hair in the eyebrows, and thehollow pits that form around them; at this period the animalis supposed to be about sixteen<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> years old. In the human<pb n="3061" />teeth there is a certain venom; for if they are placed uncoveredbefore a mirror, they will tarnish its brightness, and they willkill young pigeons while yet unfledged. The other particulars relative to the teeth have been already<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> mentionedunder the head of the generation of man. When teethingfirst commences, the bodies of infants are subject to certainmaladies. Those animals which have serrated teeth inflict themost dangerous bites.<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is only in the horse and the ass that these indications can be relied upon.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Columellares.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This has no such effect.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The contrary is the case: it will he more prolific.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Swine change them just the same as other animals.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">By certain appearances in the incisors, the age of a horse up to itstwenty-fourth year, or even beyond, may be judged of: the other signscannot be so positively relied upon.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">B. viii. c. 15.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">S¾vissima dentibus," seems to be a preferable reading to " s¾vissimedentiunt.
