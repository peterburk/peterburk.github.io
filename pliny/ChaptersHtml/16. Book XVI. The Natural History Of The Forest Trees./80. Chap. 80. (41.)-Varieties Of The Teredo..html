Theteredo has a head remarkably large in proportion to the otherpart of the body, and gnaws away the wood with its teeth:its attacks, however, are confined solely to the sea, and it isgenerally thought that this is the only insect that is properlyso called. The wood-worm that prevails on the land is knownas the " tinea," while those which resemble a gnat in appearance are called "thripes." The fourth kind of wood-wormbelongs to the maggot class; some of them being engenderedby the corruption of the juices of the wood itself, and othersbeing produced, just as in the trees, by the worm known asthe cerastes.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> When this worm has eaten away enough ofthe wood to enable it to turn round, it gives birth to another.The generation of these insects is prevented, however, by thebitterness that exists in some woods, the cypress, and thehardness of others, the box, for instance.</p><p>It is said, too, that the fir, if barked about the time of budding, and at the period of the moon already mentioned,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> willnever spoil in water. The followers of Alexander the Greathave left a statement that, at Tylos, an island in the Red Sea,<pb n="3426" />there are trees, of which ships are built, the wood of whichhas been found uninjured at the end of two hundred years,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>even if it has been under water all that time. They say, also,that in the same island there is a certain shrub,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> about thethickness of a walking-stick only, and spotted like a tiger'sskin: it is very heavy, and will break like glass if it happensto fall upon a hard substance.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xvii. c. 37.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In c. 74.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There is nothing very surprising in this, as most woods are preservedbetter when completely immersed in water, than when exposed to the variations of the atmosphere.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He borrows this fable from Theophrastus, B. v. c. 5.</p></body>
