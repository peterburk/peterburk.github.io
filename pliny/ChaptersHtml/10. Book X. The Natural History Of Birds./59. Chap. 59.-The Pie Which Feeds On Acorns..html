These birds loveto hear words spoken which they can utter; and not only dothey learn them, but are pleased at the task; and as they conthem over to themselves with the greatest care and attention,make no secret of the interest they feel. It is a well-knownfact, that a magpie has died before now, when it has found itselfmastered by a difficult word that it could not pronounce.Their memory, however, will fail them if they do not fromtime to time hear the same word repeated; and while they aretrying to recollect it, they will show the most extravagant joy,if they happen to hear it. Their appearance, although thereis nothing remarkable in it, is by no means plain; but theyhave quite sufficient beauty in their singular ability to imitatethe human speech.</p><p>It is said, however, that it is only the kind<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> of pie whichfeeds upon acorns that can be taught to speak; and thatamong these, those which<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> have five toes on each foot can betaught with the greatest facility; but in their case even, onlyduring the first two years of their life. The magpie has abroader tongue than is usual with most other birds; whichis the case also with all the other birds that can imitate thehuman voice; although some individuals of almost every kindhave the faculty of doing so.</p><p>Agrippina, the wife of Claudius Cæsar, had a thrush thatcould imitate human speech, a thing that was never knownbefore. At the moment that I am writing this, the young<pb n="2524" />Cæsars<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> have a starling and some nightingales that are beingtaught to talk in Greek and Latin; besides which, they arestudying their task the whole day, continually repeating thenew words that they have learnt, and giving utterance tophrases even of considerable length. Birds are taught totalk in a retired spot, and where no other voice can be heard,so as to interfere with their lesson; a person sits by them, andcontinually repeats the words he wishes them to learn, whileat the same time he encourages them by giving them food.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier says that this is the jay, the Corvus glandarius of Linnæus;but that they are not more apt at speaking than the other kinds.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier remarks, that these can only be monstrosities.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Britannicus, the son of Claudius, and Nero, his stepson.</p></body>
