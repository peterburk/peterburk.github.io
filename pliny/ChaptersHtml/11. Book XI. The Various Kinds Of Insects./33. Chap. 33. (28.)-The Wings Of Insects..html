(28.)ÑTHE WINGS OF INSECTS.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span></head><p>There are some insects which have two wings, flies, forinstance; others, again, have four, like the bee. The wingsof the grasshopper are membranous. Those insects which arearmed with a sting in the abdomen, have four wings. Noneof those which have a sting in the mouth, have more thantwo wings. The former have received the sting for the purpose of defending themselves, the latter for the supplying oftheir wants. If pulled from off the body, the wings of aninsect will not grow again; no insect which has a sting inserted in its body, has two wings only.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier says that the observations in this Chapter, derived from Aristotle, are remarkable for their exactness, and show that that philosopherhad studied insects with the greatest attention.</p></body>
