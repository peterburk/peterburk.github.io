<div2 type="chapter" n="9" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 9. (9.)ÑEGYPT AND THEBAIS.</head><p>Joining on to Africa is Asia, the extent of which, accordingto Timosthenes, from the Canopic mouth of the Nileto the mouth of the Euxine, is 2639 miles. From themouth of the Euxine to that of Lake M¾otis is, according toEratosthenes, 1545 miles. The whole distance to the Tanais,including Egypt, is, according to Artemidorus andIsidorus, 6375<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> miles. The seas of Egypt, which are several<pb n="1407" />in number, have received their names from those who dwellupon their shores, for which reason they will be mentionedtogether.</p><p>Egypt is the country which lies next to Africa; in the interiorit runs in a southerly direction, as far as the territoryof the ®thiopians, who lie extended at the back of it. Theriver Nile, dividing itself, forms on the right and left theboundary of its lower part, which it embraces on every side<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>.By the Canopic mouth of that river it is separated fromAfrica, and by the Pelusiac from Asia, there being a distancebetween the two of 170 miles. For this reason it is thatsome persons have reckoned Egypt among the islands, theNile so dividing itself as to give a triangular form to theland which it encloses: from which circumstance alsomany persons have named Egypt the Delta<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>, after that ofthe Greek letter so called. The distance from the spotwhere the channel of the river first divides into branches, tothe Canopic mouth, is 146 miles, and to the Pelusiac, 166.</p><p>The upper part of Egypt, which borders on ®thiopia, isknown as Thebais. This district is divided into prefecturesof towns, which are generally designated as "Nomes."These are Ombites<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, Apollopolites<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>, Hermonthites<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>, Thinites<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>,Phaturites<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>, Coptites<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>, Tentyrites<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>, Diopolites<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>, An-<pb n="1408" />t¾opolites<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>, Aphroditopolites<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>, and Lycopolites<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>. The districtwhich lies in the vicinity of Pelusium contains thefollowing Nomes, Pharb¾thites, Bubastites<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>, Sethroites,and Tanites<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span>. The remaining Nomes are those called theArabian; the Hammonian, which lies on the road to theoracle of Jupiter Hammon; and those known by the namesof Oxyrynchites, Leontopolites, Athribites<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span>, Cynopolites<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span>,Hermopolites<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span>, Xoites, Mendesim, Sebennytes<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span>, Cabasites,Latopolites, Heliopolites, Prosopites, Panopolites, Busirites<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span>,Onuphites<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span>, Sa•tes<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span>, Ptenethu, Phthemphu<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span>, Naucratites<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span>,Metelites, Gyn¾copolites, Menelaites,Ñall in the region ofAlexandria, besides Mareotis in Libya.</p><p>Heracleopolites<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span> is a Nome on an island<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span> of the Nile,<pb n="1409" />fifty miles in length, upon which there is a city, called the'City of Hercules.' There are two places called Arsino•tes<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span>:these and Memphites<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span> extend to the apex<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span> of the Delta; adjoiningto which, on the side of Africa, are the two Nomesof Oasites<span id="ref_31"><a href="#note_31">[31]</a></span>. Some writers vary in some of these names andsubstitute for them other Nomes, such as Herošpolites<span id="ref_32"><a href="#note_32">[32]</a></span>and Crocodilopolites<span id="ref_33"><a href="#note_33">[33]</a></span>. Between Arsino•tes and Memphites,a lake<span id="ref_34"><a href="#note_34">[34]</a></span>, 250 miles, or, according to what Mucianussays, 450 miles in circumference and fifty paces deep,has been formed by artificial means: after the king bywhose orders it was made, it is called by the name of MÏris.The distance from thence to Memphis is nearly sixty-twomiles, a place which was formerly the citadel of the kings ofEgypt; from thence to the oracle of Hammon it is twelvedays' journey. Memphis is fifteen miles from the spot wherethe river Nile divides into the different channels which wehave mentioned as forming the Delta.<pb n="1410" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is not improbable that these numbers are incorrectly stated in the MSS. of our author.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Parisot remarks that Pliny is in error in this statement. A considerable part of Lower Egypt lay both on the right and left of the Delta or island formed by the branches of the Nile. It must be remembered, however, that our author has already included a portion of what was strictly Egypt, in his description of Libya Mareotis.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">By reason of its triangular form, <foreign lang="greek">D.</foreign></p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Ombite nome worshipped the crocodile as the emblem of Sebak.

Its capital was Cynopolis; which is to be distinguished from the Deltic city and other places of that name, as this was a nome of the Heptanomis or Middle Egypt, to which also the Hammonian nome belonged.</p><p><span id="note_19"><a href="#ref_19">19. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The border nome of Upper and Middle Egypt.</p><p><span id="note_20"><a href="#ref_20">20. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Its capital was Pachnamunis.

By some authors it is made part of the Saitic nome. The names given by Pliny vary very considerably from those found in others of the ancient writers.</p><p><span id="note_26"><a href="#ref_26">26. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The capital of this nome was Heracleopolis, 'The city of Hercules,' as Pliny calls it, situate, as he says, on an island, at the entrance of the nome of Arsino•tes, formed by the Nile and a canal. After Memphis and Heliopolis, it was probably the most important city couth of the Thebaid. Its ruins are inconsiderable; a portion of them are to be seen at the modern hamlet of Amasieh.</p><p><span id="note_27"><a href="#ref_27">27. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The capital of this nome was Heracleopolis, 'The city of Hercules,' as Pliny calls it, situate, as he says, on an island, at the entrance of the nome of Arsino•tes, formed by the Nile and a canal.

The former is denoted by the modern district of El-Fayoom, the most fertile of ancient Egypt. At this place the crocodile was worshipped. The Labyrinth and Lake MÏris were in this nome. Extensive ruins at Medinet-el-Fayoom, or El-Fares, represent its site. The modern Ardscherud, a village near Suez, corresponds to Arsino‘ on the Red Sea. There is some little doubt however whether this last Arsino‘ is the one here meant by Pliny.</p><p><span id="note_29"><a href="#ref_29">29. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Memphis was the chief city of this nome, which was situate in Middle Egypt, and was the capital of the whole country, and the residence of the Pharaohs, who succeeded Psammetichus, B.C. <date value="-616" authname="-616">616</date>. This nome rose in importance on the decline of the kingdom of Thebais, but was afterwards eclipsed by the progress of Alexandria under the successors of Alexander the Great.</p><p><span id="note_30"><a href="#ref_30">30. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">At which Middle Egypt terminates.</p><p><span id="note_31"><a href="#ref_31">31. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">They are more generally looked upon as forming one nome only, and included under the name of Hammonium.</p><p><span id="note_32"><a href="#ref_32">32. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Its chief town was Herošpolis, a principal seat of the worship of Typhon, the evil or destroying genius.</p><p><span id="note_33"><a href="#ref_33">33. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The same as the nome of Arsino•tes, the capital of which, Arsino‘, was originally called Crocodilopolis.</p><p><span id="note_34"><a href="#ref_34">34. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now known as Birket-el-Keroum. This was a vast lake on the western side of the Nile in Middle Egypt, used for the reception and subsequent distribution of a part of the overflow of the Nile. The supposition that it was formed by artificial means is now pretty generally exploded, and it is regarded as of natural formation. It was situate in the nome of Arsino•tes or Crocodilopolites. Its length seems to be overstated by our author, as at the present day it is only thirty miles in length and five in breadth at the widest part.</p></body>
