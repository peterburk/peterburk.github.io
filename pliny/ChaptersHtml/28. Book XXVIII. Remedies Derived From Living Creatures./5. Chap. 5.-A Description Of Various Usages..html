Why, in fact, uponthe first day of the new year, do we accost one another withprayers for good fortune,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and, for luck's sake, wish each othera happy new year? Why, too, upon the occasion of publiclustrations, do we select persons with lucky names, to lead thevictims? Why, to counteract fascinations, do we Romansobserve a peculiar form of adoration, in invoking the Nemesisof the Greeks; whose statue, for this reason, has been placedin the Capitol at Rome, although the goddess herself possessesno Latin name?<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> Why, when we make mention of the dead,do we protest that we have no wish<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> to impeach their goodname?<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> Why is it that we entertain the belief that for everypurpose odd numbers are the most effectual;<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>Ña thing that isparticularly observed with reference to the critical days infevers? Why is it that, when gathering the earliest fruit,apples, on pears, as the case may be, we make a point of saying</p><p>"This fruit is old, may other fruit be sent us that is new?"Why is it that we salute<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> a person when he sneezes, an observance which Tiberius C¾sar, they say, the most unsociable ofmen, as we all know, used to exact, when riding in his chariot<pb n="5284" />even? Some there are, too, who think it a point religiouslyto be observed to mention the name as well of the person whomthey salute.</p><p>And then, besides, it is a notion<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> universally received, thatabsent persons have warning that others are speaking of them,by the tingling of the ears. Attalus<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> assures us, that if aperson, the moment he sees a scorpion, says "Duo,"<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> the reptile will stop short, and forbear to sting. And now that I amspeaking of the scorpion, I recall to mind that in Africa no oneever undertakes any matter without prefacing with the word"Africa;" while in other countries, before an enterprise iscommenced, it is the practice to adjure the gods that theywill manifest their good will.</p><p>In addition to this, it is very clear that there are somereligious observances, unaccompanied by speech, which areconsidered to be productive of certain effects. Thus,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> whenwe are at table, for instance, it is the universal practice, wesee, to take the ring from off the finger. Another person,again, will take some spittle from his mouth and place it withhis finger behind the ear, to propitiate and modify disquietudeof mind. When we wish to signify applause, we have a proverbeven which tells us we should press the thumbs.<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> When paying adoration, we kiss the right hand, and turn the wholebody to the right: while the people of the Gallic provinces, onthe contrary, turn to the left, and believe that they showmere devoutness by so doing. To salute summer lightningwith clapping of the hands, is the universal practice with allnations. If, when eating, we happen to make mention of afire that has happened, we avert the inauspicious omen by pouring water beneath the table. To sweep the floor at the momentthat a person is rising from table, or to remove the tableor tray,<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> as the case may be, while a guest is drinking, islooked upon as a most unfortunate presage. There is a treatise,<pb n="5285" />written by Servius Sulpicius, a man of the highest rank, inwhich reasons are given why we should never leave the tablewe are eating at; for in his day it was not yet<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> the practice toreckon more tables than guests at an entertainment. Where aperson has sneezed, it is considered highly ominous for thedish or table to be brought back again, and not a taste thereofto be taken, after doing so; the same, too, where a person attable eats nothing at all.</p><p>These usages have been established by persons who entertained a belief that the gods are ever present, in all our affairsand at all hours, and who have therefore found the means of appeasing them by our vices even. It has been remarked, too,that there is never a dead silence on a sudden among the guestsat table, except when there is an even number present; whenthis happens, too, it is a sign that the good name and repute ofevery individual present is in peril. In former times, whenfood fell from the hand of a guest, it was the custom to returnit by placing it on the table, and it was forbidden<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> to blowupon it, for the purpose of cleansing it. Auguries, too, have beenderived from the words or thoughts of a person at the momentsuch an accident befalls him; and it is looked upon as one ofthe most dreadful of presages, if this should happen to a pontiff,while celebrating the feast of Dis.<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> The proper expiation insuch a case is, to have the morsel replaced on table, and thenburnt in honour of the Lar.<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> Medicines, it is said, will proveineffectual, if they happen to have been placed on a table beforethey are administered. It is religiously believed by many,that it is ominous in a pecuniary point of view, for a person topare his nails without speaking, on the market days<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> at Rome,or to begin at the forefinger<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> in doing so: it is thought, too,<pb n="5286" />to be a preventive of baldness and of head-ache, to cut the hairon the seventeenth and twenty-ninth<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> days of the moon.</p><p>A rural law observed in most of the farms of Italy, forbids<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span>women to twirl their distaffs, or even to carry them uncovered,while walking in the public roads; it being a thing so prejudicial to all hopes and anticipations, those of a good harvest<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span>in particular. It is not so long ago, that M. ServiliusNonianus, the principal citizen at Rome,<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> being apprehensiveof ophthalmia, had a paper, with the two Greek letters P andA<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span> written upon it, wrapped in linen and attached to his neck,before he would venture to name the malady, and before anyother person had spoken to him about it. Mucianus, too, whowas thrice consul, following a similar observance, carried abouthim a living fly, wrapped in a piece of white linen; and itwas strongly asserted, by both of them, that to the use of theseexpedients they owed their preservation from ophthalmia.There are in existence, also, certain charms against hail-storms,diseases of various kinds, and burns, some of which have beenproved, by actual experience, to be effectual; but so great is thediversity of opinion upon them, that I am precluded by afeeling of extreme diffidence from entering into further particulars, and must therefore leave each to form his own conclusions as he may feel inclined.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See Ovid's Fasti, B. i. 1. 175, <hi rend="ital">et seq.,</hi> and Epist. de Ponto.
