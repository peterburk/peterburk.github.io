(32.)—THE CHRYSALIS.</head><p>Many insects, however, are engendered in a different manner; and some more especially from dew. This dew settlesupon the radish<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> leaf in the early days of spring; but when ithas been thickened by the action of the sun, it becomes reduced to the size of a grain of millet. From this a small grubafterwards arises, which, at the end of three days, becomestransformed into a caterpillar. For several successive daysit still increases in size, but remains motionless, and coveredwith a hard husk. It moves only when touched, and iscovered with a web like that of the spider. In this state itis called a chrysalis, but after the husk is broken, it flies forthin the shape of a butterfly.<pb n="3040" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier observes, that this is a very correct account of the cabbageor radish butterfly, the Papilio brassicæ or Papilio raphani of Linnæus.</p></body>
