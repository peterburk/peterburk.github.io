<div2 type="chapter" n="73" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 73—THE METHODS OF STORING CORN.</head><p>Connected with this branch of our subject is the method ofstoring corn. Some persons recommend that granaries shouldbe built for the purpose at considerable expense, the walls<pb n="4105" />being made of brick, and not less than three<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> feet thick; thecorn, they say, should be let in from above, the air beingcarefully excluded, and no windows allowed. Others, again,say that the granary should have an aspect in no direction butthe north-east or north, and that the walls should be builtwithout lime, that substance being extremely injurious<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> tocorn; as to what we find recommended in reference to amurcaof olives, we have already mentioned it on a former<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> occasion.In some places they build their granaries of wood, and uponpillars,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> thinking it the best plan to leave access for the air onevery side, and from below even. Some persons think, how-ever, that the grain diminishes in bulk if laid on a floor abovethe level of the ground, and that it is liable to ferment beneatha roof of tiles. Many persons say, too, that the grain shouldnever be stirred up to air<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> it, as the weevil is never known topenetrate beyond four fingers in depth; consequently, beyondthat depth there is no danger. According to Columella,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> thewest wind is beneficial to grain, a thing that surprises me, asthat wind is generally a very parching<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> one. Some personsrecommend that, before housing the corn, a bramble-frogshould be hung up by one of the hind legs at the threshold ofthe granary. To me it appears that the most important precaution ofall is to house the grain at the proper time; for ifit is unripe when cut, and not sufficiently firm, or if it is gotin a heated state, it follows of necessity that noxious insectswill breed in it.</p><p>There are several causes which contribute to the preservation ofgrain; the outer<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> coats in some kinds are more numerous, as inmillet, for instance; the juices are of an oleaginous nature,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> and sosupply ample moisture, as in sesame,for example; while in other kinds, again, they are naturally<pb n="4106" />bitter,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> as in the lupine and the chicheling vetch. It is inwheat more particularly that insects breed, as it is apt to heatfrom the density of its juices, and the grain is covered with athick bran. In barley the chaff is thinner, and the same is thecase with all the leguminous seeds: it is for this reason that theydo not ordinarily breed insects. The bean, however, is coveredwith a coat of a thicker substance: and hence it is that it ferments.Some persons sprinkle wheat, in order to make itkeep the longer, with amurea<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> of olives, a quadrantal to athousand modii: others, again, with powdered Chalcidian orCarian chalk, or with worm-wood.<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> There is a certain earthfound at Olynthus, and at Cerinthus, in Eubœa, which prevents grainfrom spoiling. If garnered in the ear, grain ishardly ever found to suffer any injury.</p><p>The best plan, however, of preserving grain, is to lay it upin trenches, called "siri," as they do in Cappadocia, Thracia,Spain, and at * * * in Africa. Particular care is taken todig these trenches in a dry soil, and a layer of chaff is thenplaced at the bottom the grain, too, is always stored in theear. In this case, if no air is allowed to penetrate to the corn,we may rest assured that no noxious insects will ever breedin it. Varro<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> says, that wheat, if thus stored, will keep aslong as fifty years, and millet a hundred; and he assures usthat beans and other leguminous grain, if put away in oil jarswith a covering of ashes, will keep for a great length of time.He makes a statement, also, to the effect that some beans werepreserved in a cavern in Ambracia from the time of KingPyrrhus until the Piratical War of Pompeius Magnus, a periodof about two hundred and twenty years.</p><p>The chick-pea is the only grain in which no insect willbreed while in the granary. Some persons place upon theheaps of the leguminous grains pitchers full of vinegar andcoated with pitch, a stratum of ashes being laid beneath; andthey fancy that if this is done, no injury will happen. Some,again, store them in vessels which have held salted provisions,with a coating of plaster on the top, while other persons are<pb n="4107" />in the habit of sprinkling lentils with vinegar scented withlaser,<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> and, when dry, giving them a covering of oil. Butthe most effectual method of all is to get in everythingthat you would preserve from injury at the time of themoon's conjunction; and hence it is of the greatest importance toknow, when getting in the harvest, whether it isfor garnering or whether for immediate sale. If cut during theincrease of the moon, grain will increase in size.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Palladius, i. 19, says <hi rend="ital">two</hi> feet.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">On account of the damp.
