But in man the varieties and diversities are mostnumerous; the eyes being either large, of middling size, remarkably small, or remarkably prominent. These last aregenerally supposed to be very weak, while those which aredeep-seated are considered the best, as is the case also withthose which in colour resemble the eyes of the goat.</p></div2></body>
