<div2 type="chapter" n="35" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 35.—CABBAGE-SPROUTS.</head><p>In all varieties of the cabbage, the part most agreeable tothe taste is the cyma,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> although no use is made of it in medicine, as it is difficult to digest, and by no means beneficial tothe kidneys. At the same time, too, it should not be omitted,that the water in which it has been boiled,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and which is sohighly praised for many purposes, gives out a very bad smellwhen poured upon the ground. The ashes of dried cabbage-stalks are generally reckoned among the caustic substances:mixed with stale grease, they are employed for sciatica,and, used as a liniment, in the form of a depilatory, toge-ther with silphium<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and vinegar, they prevent hair that hasbeen once removed from growing again. These ashes, too, aretaken lukewarm in oil, or else by themselves, for convulsions, internal ruptures, and the effects of falls with violence.</p><p>And are we to say then that the cabbage is possessed of noevil qualities whatever? Certainly not, for the same authorstell us, that it is apt to make the breath smell, and that it isinjurious to the teeth and gums. In Egypt, too, it is nevereaten, on account of its extreme bitterness.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span><pb n="4240" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Sprout," or "Brussels sprout."
