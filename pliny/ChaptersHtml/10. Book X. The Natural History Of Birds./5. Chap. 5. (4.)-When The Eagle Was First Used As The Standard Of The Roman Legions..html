(4.)—WHEN THE EAGLE WAS FIRST USED AS THESTANDARD OF THE ROMAN LEGIONS.</head><p>Caius Marius, in his second consulship, assigned the eagleexclusively to the Roman legions. Before that period it hadonly held the first rank, there being four others as well, thewolf, the minotaur, the horse, and the wild boar, each of whichpreceded a single division.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> Some few years before his timeit had begun to be the custom to carry the eagle only intobattle, the other standards being left behind in camp; Marius,however, abolished the rest of them entirely. Since then, ithas been remarked that hardly ever has a Roman legionencamped for the winter, without a pair of eagles makingtheir appearance at the spot.</p><p>The first and second species of eagle, not only prey upon<pb n="2486" />the whole of the smaller quadrupeds, but will attack deereven. Rolling in the dust, the eagle covers its body all overwith it, and then perching on the antlers of the animal, shakesthe dust into its eyes, while at the same time it beats it on thehead with its wings, until the creature at last precipitates itselfdown the rocks. Nor, indeed, is this one enemy sufficient forit; it has still more terrible combats with the dragon,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> andthe issue is much more doubtful, although the battle is foughtin the air. The dragon seeks the eggs of the eagle with amischievous avidity; while the eagle, in return, carries it offwhenever it happens to see it; upon these occasions, the dragoncoils itself about the wings of the bird in multiplied folds,until at last they fall to the earth together.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ordinem.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See Virgil, Æn.
