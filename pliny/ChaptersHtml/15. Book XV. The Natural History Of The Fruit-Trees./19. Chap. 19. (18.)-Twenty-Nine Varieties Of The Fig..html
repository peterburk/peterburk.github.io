<div2 type="chapter" n="19" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 19. (18.)—TWENTY-NINE VARIETIES OF THE FIG.</head><p>Of all the remaining fruits that are included under thename of "pomes," the fig<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> is the largest: some, indeed, equalthe pear, even, in size. We have already mentioned, whiletreating of the exotic fruits, the miraculous productions ofEgypt and Cyprus<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> in the way of figs. The fig of MountIda<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> is red, and the size of an olive, rounder however, andlike a medlar in flavour; they give it the name of Alexandrian in those parts. The stem is a cubit in thickness; it isbranchy, has a tough, pliant wood, is entirely destitute of allmilky juice,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and has a green bark, and leaves like those of thelinden tree, but soft to the touch. Onesicritus states that inHyrcania the figs are much sweeter than with us, and that thetrees are more prolific, seeing that a single tree will bear asmuch as two hundred and seventy modii<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> of fruit. The fighas been introduced into Italy from other countries, Chalcisand Chios, for instance, the varieties being very numerous:there are those from Lydia also, which are of a purple colour,and the kind known as the "mamillana,"<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> which is verysimilar to the Lydian. The callistruthiæ are very little superior to the last in flavour; they are the coldest by nature ofall the figs. As to the African fig, by many people preferredto any other, it has been made the subject of very considerable discussion, as it is a kind that has been introduced veryrecently into Africa, though it bears the name of that country.<pb n="3308" />As to the fig of Alexandria,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> it is a black variety, with thecleft inclining to white; it has had the name given to it ofthe "delicate"<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> fig: the Rhodian fig, too, and the Tiburtine,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>one of the early kinds, are black. Some of them, again, bearthe name of the persons who were the first to introduce them,such, for instance, as the Livian<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> and the Pompeian<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> figs: thislast variety is the best for drying in the sun and keeping foruse, from year to year; the same is the case, too, with themarisca,<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> and the kind which has a leaf spotted all over likethe reed.<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> There is also the Herculanean fig, the albicerata,<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>and the white aratia, a very large variety, with an extremelydiminutive stalk.</p><p>The earliest of them all is the porphyritis,<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> which has astalk of remarkable length: it is closely followed by the popularis,<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> one of the very smallest of the figs, and so called fromthe low esteem in which it is held: on the other hand, thechelidonia<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> is a kind that ripens the last of all, and to-wards the beginning of winter. In addition to these, there arefigs that are at the same time both late and early, as they beartwo crops in the year, one white and the other black,<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> ripening at harvest-time and vintage respectively. There is anotherlate fig also, that has received its name from the singularhardness of its skin; one of the Chalcidian varieties bears asmany as three times in the year. It is at Tarentum only thatthe remarkably sweet fig is grown which is known by thename of "ona."</p><p>Speaking of figs, Cato has the following remarks: "Plantthe fig called the 'marisca' on a chalky or open site, but forthe African variety, the Herculanean, the Saguntine,<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> the<pb n="3309" />winter fig and the black Telanian<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> with a long stalk, youmust select a richer soil, or else a ground well manured."Since his day there have so many names and kinds come up,that even on taking this subject into consideration, it must beapparent to every one how great are the changes which havetaken place in civilized life.</p><p>There are winter figs, too, in some of the provinces, theMœsian, for instance; but they are made so by artificial means,such not being in reality their nature. Being a smallvariety of the fig-tree, they cover it up with manure at the endof autumn, by which means the fruit on it is overtaken bywinter while still in a green state: then when the weather,becomes milder the fruit is uncovered along with the tree, andso restored to light. Just as though it had come into birthafresh, the fruit imbibes the heat of the new sun with thegreatest avidity—a different sun, in fact, to that<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> which originally gave it life—and so ripens along with the blossom ofthe coming crop; thus attaining maturity in a year not itsown, and this in a country,<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> too, where the greatest coldprevails.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There are about forty varieties now known.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">B. xiii. c. 14, 15.
