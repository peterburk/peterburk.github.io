It will duly salute an emperor, and pronounce the words it has heard spoken; it isrendered especially frolicsome under the influence of wine.Its head is as hard as its beak; and this, when it is beingtaught to talk, is beaten with a rod of iron, for otherwise itis quite insensible to blows. When it lights on the ground itfalls upon its beak, and by resting upon it makes itself allthe lighter for its feet, which are naturally weak.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hence the Latin name "psittacus." From this, Cuvier thinks thatthe first known among these birds to the Greeks and Romans, was thegreen perroquet with a ringed neck, the Psittacus Alexandri of Linnæus.</p></body>
