<div2 type="chapter" n="70" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 70.ÑFABULOUS BIRDS.</head><p>I look upon the birds as fabulous which are called "pegasi,"and are said to have a horse's head; as also the griffons, withlong ears and a hooked beak. The former are said to be natives of Scythia,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> the latter of ®thiopia. The same is myopinion, also, as to the tragopan;<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> many writers, however,assert that it is larger than the eagle, has curved horns on thetemples, and a plumage of iron colour, with the exception ofthe head, which is purple. Nor yet do the sirens<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> obtain anygreater credit with me, although Dinon, the father of Clearchus,a celebrated writer, asserts that they exist in India, and thatthey charm men by their song, and, having first lulled them tosleep, tear them to pieces. The person, however, who maythink fit to believe in these tales, may probably not refuse tobelieve also that dragons licked the ears of Melampodes, andbestowed upon him the power of understanding the languageof birds; as also what Democritus says, when he gives thenames of certain birds, by the mixture of whose blood a serpent is produced, the person who eats of which will be ableto understand the language of birds; as well as the statementswhich the same writer makes relative to one bird in particular,known as the "galerita,"<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>Ñindeed, the science of augury isalready too much involved in embarrassing questions, withoutthese fanciful reveries.</p><p>There is a kind of bird spoken of by Homer as the "scops:"<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>but I cannot very easily comprehend the grotesque movementswhich many persons have attributed to it, when the fowler is<pb n="2531" />laying snares for it; nor, indeed, is it a bird that is any longerknown to exist. It will be better, therefore, to confine my relation to those the existence of which is generally admitted.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Scythia and Ethiopia ought to be transposed here, as the griffonswere said to be monsters that guarded the gold in the mountains of Scythia,the Uralian chain, probably.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Literally, the "goat Pan." Cuvier thinks that the bird here alludedto actually existed, and identifies it with the napaul, or horned pheasant ofBuffon, the penelope satyra of Gmell, a bird of the north of India, andwhich answers the description here given by Pliny.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See Ovid, Met.
