In such cases the plant britannica<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>effects a cure, and the same is the case with the root of all thevarieties of panaces,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> administered in wine. The flower, too,and seed of panaces chironion are taken in drink, or appliedexternally with wine and oil: cunila bubula,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> too, is lookedupon as particularly useful for this purpose, and the root ofpolemonia or phileteris is taken in doses of four drachmæ inunmixed wine. Teucria,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> sideritis,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> and scordotis,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> are usedin wine, plants particularly good, all of them, for injuries inflicted by snakes; the juice or leaves, or else a decoction of<pb n="5119" />them, being taken in drink or applied to the wound. For asimilar purpose also, the root of the greater centaury is taken,in doses of one drachma to three cyathi of white wine. Gentian,too, is particularly good for the stings of snakes, taken eitherfresh or dried, in doses of two drachmæ, mixed with rue andpepper in six cyathi of wine. The odour, too, of lysimachia<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> puts serpents to flight.</p><p>Chelidonia<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> is also given in wine to persons who have beenstung; and betony in particular is used as an external application to the wound, a plant the virtues of which are so extraordinary, it is said, that if a circle of it is traced around aserpent, it will lash itself to death<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> with its tail. The seedof this plant is also administered in such cases, in doses of onedenarius to three cyathi of wine; or else it is dried and powdered, and applied to the wound, in the proportion of threedenarii of powder to one sextarius of water.</p><p>Cantabrica, dittany, and aristolochia, are also similarly used,one drachma of the root of this last plant being taken everynow and then in a semisextarius of wine. It is very usefultoo, rubbed in with vinegar, and the same is the case, also,with plistolochia:<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> indeed it will be quite sufficient to suspendthis last over the hearth, to make all serpents leave the house.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See c. 6 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See cc. 11, 12, 13, 14, of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xx. c. 61.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxiv. c. 80.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See c. 15 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See c. 27 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See c. 35 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See c. 50 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xvi. c. 24.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See c. 54 of this Book.
