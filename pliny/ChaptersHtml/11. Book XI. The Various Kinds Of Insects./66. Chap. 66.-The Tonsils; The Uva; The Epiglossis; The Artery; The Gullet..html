<div2 type="chapter" n="66" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 66.ÑTHE TONSILS; THE UVA; THE EPIGLOSSIS; THEARTERY; THE GULLET.</head><p>In man there are tonsils at the root of the tongue; these inswine are called the glandules. The uvula,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> which is suspendedbetween them at the extremity of the palate, is found onlyin man. Beneath this lies a smaller tongue, known by the<pb n="3063" />name of "epiglossis,"<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> but it is wanting in animals that areoviparous. Placed as it is between two passages, the functionsof the epiglottis are of a twofold nature. The one of thesepassages that lies more inward is called the [tracheal] artery,and leads to the lungs and the heart: the epiglottis covers itduring the action of eating, that the drink or food may not gothe wrong way, and so be productive of suffering, as it is bythis passage that the breath and the voice are conveyed. Theother or exterior passage is called the "gula,"<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and it is bythis passage that the victuals and drink pass: this leads to thebelly, while the former one communicates with the chest.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>The epiglottis covers the pharynx, in its turn, when only thebreath or the voice is passing, in order that the victuals maynot inopportunely pass upwards, and so disturb the breathingor articulation. The tracheal artery is composed of cartilageand flesh, while the gullet is formed of a sinewy substanceunited with flesh.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">" Uva, " or "grape."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">More generally " epiglottis."
