<div2 type="chapter" n="45" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 45.â€”VARIOUS OBSERVATIONS RESPECTINGWINDS.</head><p>But there is a great difference between a gale and a wind<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>.The former are uniform and appear to rush forth<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>; they arefelt, not in certain spots only, but over whole countries, notforming breezes or squalls, but violent storms<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>. Whetherthey be produced by the constant revolution of the worldand the opposite motion of the stars, or whether they bothof them depend on the generative spirit of the nature of<pb n="1072" />things, wandering, as it were, up and down in her womb, orwhether the air be scourged by the irregular strokes of thewandering stars<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, or the various projections of their rays, orwhether they, each of them, proceed from their own stars,among which are those that are nearest to us, or whetherthey descend from those that are fixed in the heavens, it ismanifest that they are all governed by a law of nature, whichis not altogether unknown, although it be not completelyascertained.</p><p>(46.) More than twenty old Greek writers have publishedtheir observations upon this subject. And this is the more remarkable, seeing that there is so much discord in the world,and that it is divided into different kingdoms, that is intoseparate members, that there should have been so many whohave paid attention to these subjects, which are so difficultto investigate. Especially when we consider the wars andthe treachery which everywhere prevail; while pirates, theenemies of the human race, have possession of all the modesof communication, so that, at this time, a person may acquiremore correct information about a country from the writingsof those who have never been there, than from the inhabitants themselves. Whereas, at this day, in the blessedpeace which we enjoy, under a prince who so greatly encourages the advancement of the arts, no new inquiries areset on foot, nor do we even make ourselves thoroughly mastersof the discoveries of the ancients. Not that there weregreater rewards held out, from the advantages being distributed to a greater number of persons, but that there weremore individuals who diligently scrutinized these matters,with no other prospect but that of benefiting posterity. Itis that the manners of men are degenerated, not that theadvantages are diminished. All the seas, as many as thereare, being laid open, and a hospitable reception being givenus at every shore, an immense number of people undertakevoyages; but it is for the sake of gain, not of science. Nordoes their understanding, which is blinded and bent only onavarice, perceive that this very thing might be more safelydone by means of science. Seeing, therefore, that there areso many thousands of persons on the seas, I will treat of the<pb n="1073" />winds with more minuteness than perhaps might otherwiseappear suitable to my undertaking.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The terms in the original are "flatus" and "ventus."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"illos (flatus) states atque perspirantes."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"qui non aura, non procella, sed mares appellatione quoque ipsa ventisunt."
