It is a species of hedgehog, but thequills of the porcupine are longer, and when it stretches theskin, it discharges them like so many missiles. With these itpierces the mouths of the dogs which are pressing hard uponit, and even sends its darts to some distance further<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> Itconceals itself during the winter months, which, indeed, is thenature of many animals, and more especially the bear.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is possible that the quills of the porcupine may be stuck into theskin of the dog so firmly, as to be detached from their natural situation;but there is no reason to believe that they can be darted out or projectedby any exertion of the animal. ®lian, Anim. Nat. B. i. c. 31, and B. xii.c. 26, describes the hystrix; see also Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. vi, c.30.ÑB.</p></body>
