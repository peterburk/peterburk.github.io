<div2 type="chapter" n="16" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 16.ÑTHE ANIMALS OF THE NORTH; THE ELK, THE ACHLIS, AND THE BONASUS.</head><p>The North, too, produces herds of wild horses, as Africa andAsia do of wild asses;<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> there is, also, the elk, which stronglyresembles our steers, except that it is distinguished by thelength of the ears and of the neck. There is also the achlis,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>which is produced in the island of Scandinavia;<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> it has neverbeen seen in this city, although we have had descriptions ofit from many persons; it is not unlike the elk, but has nojoints in the hind leg. Hence, it never lies down, but reclinesagainst a tree while it sleeps; it can only be taken by previously cutting into the tree, and thus laying a trap for it, asotherwise, it would escape through its swiftness. Its upper lipis so extremely large, for which reason it is obliged to go backwards when grazing; otherwise, by moving onwards, the lipwould get doubled up. In P¾onia, it is said, there is a wild<pb n="2264" />animal known as the bonasus;<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> it has the mane of the horse,but is, in other respects, like the bull, with horns, however, somuch bent inwards upon each other, as to be of no use for thepurposes of combat. It has therefore to depend upon itsflight, and, while in the act of flying, it sends forth its excrements, sometimes to a distance of even three jugera;<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> thecontact of which burns those who pursue the animal, just likea kind of fire.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We learn from various travellers, that there are troops of wild horsesand asses in many parts of Tartary and the neighbouring countries; butit is doubtful whether they have proceeded from an original wild stock, ormay not have been the produce of some individuals which had accidentallyescaped from the domestic state.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">No doubt Pliny has fallen into an error on this subject, and his elkand achlis are, in reality, the same animal. The description of the latter,for the most part, applies to the former, with the exception of the wantof joints in the legs, which is entirely without foundation. C¾sar's account of the elk, Bell. Gall. B. vi. c. 27, agrees generally with Pliny'saccount of the achlis; he also says, that the legs of the alces are "without articulations and joints."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Romans had but a very imperfect knowledge of the Scandinavianpeninsula. They supposed it to be surrounded by the ocean, and to be composed of many islands, which Ptolemy calls Scandi¾. Of these, the largestbore especially the name of Scandia or Scandinavia, by which name themodern Sweden was probably indicated. See B. iv. c. 30.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny's account is from Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. ix. c. 45, but, as isoften the case, with considerable exaggerations. Aristotle says, that theseanimals eject their excrements to a distance of four feet, and that it is ofso acrid a nature, as to cause the hair of the dog to fall off. The wordjugerum is generally used as a measure of superficial surface.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny here renders the Greek <foreign lang="greek">ple/qron,</foreign> by "jugerum," which isordinarily a measure of superficies. In the present case, therefore, it mustmean a measure of <hi rend="ital">length,</hi> of 100 Grecian, or 104 Roman feet.</p></body>
