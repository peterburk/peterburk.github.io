<div2 type="chapter" n="95" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 95. (74.)—ANTIPATHIES OF ANIMALS. PROOFS THAT THEYARE SENSIBLE OF FRIENDSHIP AND OTHER AFFECTIONS.</head><p>Hence there will be no difficulty in perceiving that animalsare possessed of other instincts besides those previously mentioned. In fact, there are certain antipathies and sympathiesamong them, which give rise to various affections besides thosewhich we have mentioned in relation to each species in itsappropriate place. The swan and the eagle are always at<pb n="2551" />variance, and the raven and the chloreus<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> seek each other'seggs by night. In a similar manner, also, the raven and thekite are perpetually at war with one another, the one carrying off the other's food. So, too, there are antipathies betweenthe crow and the owl, the eagle and the trochilus;<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>—Betweenthe last two, if we are to believe the story, because the latterhas received the title of the "king of the birds:" the same,again, with the owlet and all the smaller birds.</p><p>Again, in relation to the terrestrial animals, the weasel is atenmity with the crow, the turtle-dove with the pyrallis,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> theichneumon with the wasp, and the phalangium with otherspiders. Among aquatic animals, there is enmity between theduck and the sea-mew, the falcon known as the "harpe," andthe hawk called the "triorchis." In a similar manner, too, theshrew-mouse and the heron are ever on the watch for eachother's young; and the ægithus,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> so small a bird as it is, hasan antipathy to the ass; for the latter, when scratching itself,rubs its body against the brambles, and so crushes the bird'snest; a thing of which it stands in such dread, that if it onlyhears the voice of the ass when it brays, it will throw its eggsout of the nest, and the young ones themselves will sometimesfall to the ground in their fright; hence it is that it will fly atthe ass, and peck at its sores with its beak. The fox, too, is atwar with the nisus,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> and serpents with weasels and swine.Æsalon<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> is the name given to a small bird that breaks the eggsof the raven, and the young of which are anxiously sought bythe fox; while in its turn it will peck at the young of the fox,and even the parent itself. As soon as the ravens espy this,they come to its assistance, as though against a common enemy.The acanthis, too, lives among the brambles; hence it is thatit also has an antipathy to the ass, because it devours thebramble blossoms. The ægithus and the anthus,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> too, are atsuch mortal enmity with each other, that it is the commonbelief that their blood will not mingle; and it is for this reasonthat they have the bad repute of being employed in many magi-<pb n="2552" />cal incantations. The thos and the lion are at war with eachother; and, indeed, the smallest objects and the greatest justas much. Caterpillars will avoid a tree that is infested withants. The spider, poised in its web, will throw itself on thehead of a serpent as it lies stretched beneath the shade of thetree where it has built, and with its bite pierce its brain; suchis the shock, that the creature will hiss from time to time, andthen, seized with vertigo, coil round and round, while itfinds itself unable to take to flight, or so much as to break theweb of the spider, as it hangs suspended above; this sceneonly ends with its death.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably the chlorion of c. 45.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Supposed to be the golden-crested wren.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">An insect.
