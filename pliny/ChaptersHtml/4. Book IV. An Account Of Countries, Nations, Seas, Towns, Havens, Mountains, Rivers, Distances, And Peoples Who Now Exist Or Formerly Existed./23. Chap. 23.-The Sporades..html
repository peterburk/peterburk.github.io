<div2 type="chapter" n="23" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 23.—THE SPORADES.</head><p>The islands thus far are considered as belonging to theCyclades; the rest that follow are the Sporades<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>. Theseare, Helene<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>, Phacussa, Nicasia, Schinussa, Pholegandros,and, at a distance of thirty-eight miles from Naxos, Icaros<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>,which has given its name to the surrounding sea, and is thesame number of miles in length<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, with two cities, and athird now no longer in existence: this island used formerlyto be called Doliche, Macris, and Ichthyoëssa<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>. It is situatefifty miles to the north-east of Delos, and thirty-five from theisland of Samos. Between Eubœa and Andros, there is anarm of the sea ten miles in width, and from Icaros toGeræstus is a distance of 112 1/2 miles.<pb n="1321" /></p><p>After we pass these, no regular order can be well observed;the rest must therefore be mentioned indiscriminately.There is the island of Scyros<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>, and that of los<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>, eighteen milesdistant from Naxos, and deserving of all veneration for thetomb there of Homer; it is twenty-five miles in length, andwas formerly known by the name of Phœnice; also Odia,Oletandros, and Gyara<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>, with a city of the same name, theisland being twelve miles in circumference, and distant fromAndros sixty-two. At a distance of eighty miles fromGyara is Syrnos, then Cynæthus, Telos<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>, noted for itsunguents, and by Callimachus called Agathussa, Donusa<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>,Patmos<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>, thirty miles in circumference, the Corassiæ<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>, Le-<pb n="1322" />binthus<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>, Leros<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>, Cinara<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>; Sicinus<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span>,formerly called Œnoe<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span>;Hieracia, also called Onus; Casos<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span>, likewise called Astrabe;Cimolus<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span>, or Echinussa; and Melos<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span>, with a city of that name,which island Aristides calls Memblis, Aristotle Zephyria, Callimachus Mimallis, Heraclides Siphis and Acytos. This lastis the most circular<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> in form of all these islands. After thiscomes Machia, then Hypere, formerly Patage, or, as othershave it, Platage, but now called Amorgos<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span>, Polyægos<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span>,Phyle, and Thera<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span>, known as Calliste when it first sprangfrom the waves. From this, at a later period, the island of<pb n="1323" />Therasia<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span> was torn away, and between the two afterwardsarose Automate, also called Hiera, and Thia, which in ourown times came into existence in the vicinity of these islands.Ios is distant from Thera twenty-five miles.</p><p>Next to these follow Lea, Ascania<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span>, Anaphe<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span>, Hippuris,and Astypalæa<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span>, a free state. This island is eighty-eightmiles in circumference, and 125 miles distant from Cadistus,in Crete. From Astypalæa, Platea is distant sixty miles,and Caminia thirty-eight from this last. We then come tothe islands of Azibintha, Lanise, Tragæa, Pharmacussa,Techedia, Chalcia<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span>, Calymna<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span>, in which is the town of Coös,Calymna, at a distance of twenty-five miles from whichis Carpathum<span id="ref_31"><a href="#note_31">[31]</a></span>, which has given its name to the CarpathianSea. The distance thence to Rhodes<span id="ref_32"><a href="#note_32">[32]</a></span>, in the direction of thesouth-west wind, is fifty miles. From Carpathum to Casusis seven miles, and from Casus to Sammonium, the promontory of Crete,thirty<span id="ref_33"><a href="#note_33">[33]</a></span>. In the Euripus of Eubœa, almostat the very mouth of it, are the four islands called Petaliæ<span id="ref_34"><a href="#note_34">[34]</a></span>;<pb n="1324" />and, at its outlet, Atalante<span id="ref_35"><a href="#note_35">[35]</a></span>. The Cyclades and the Sporadesare bounded on the east by the Asiatic shores of the IcarianSea, on the west by the Attic shores of the Myrtoan Sea,on the north by the Ægean, and on the south by the Cretanand Carpathian seas, extending 700 miles in length, and 200in breadth.</p><p>The Gulf of Pagasa<span id="ref_36"><a href="#note_36">[36]</a></span> has in front of it Euthia<span id="ref_37"><a href="#note_37">[37]</a></span>,Cicynethus<span id="ref_38"><a href="#note_38">[38]</a></span>,Scyros, previously mentioned<span id="ref_39"><a href="#note_39">[39]</a></span>, and the very furthermostof the Cyclades and Sporades, Gerontia and Scandila<span id="ref_40"><a href="#note_40">[40]</a></span>; theGulf of Thermæ<span id="ref_41"><a href="#note_41">[41]</a></span>, Iræsia, Solimnia, Eudemia, and Nea, whichlast is sacred to Minerva. Athos has before it four islands;Peparethus<span id="ref_42"><a href="#note_42">[42]</a></span>, formerly called Evœnus, with a city of that name,at a distance from Athos of nine miles; Sciathus<span id="ref_43"><a href="#note_43">[43]</a></span>, at adistance of fifteen, and Imbros<span id="ref_44"><a href="#note_44">[44]</a></span>, with a city of the samename, at a distance of eighty-eight, miles. This last islandis distant from Mastusia, in the Chersonesus, twenty-fivemiles; it is sixty-two<span id="ref_45"><a href="#note_45">[45]</a></span> miles in circumference, and is washedby the river Ilisus. At a distance of twenty-two miles fromit is Lemnos<span id="ref_46"><a href="#note_46">[46]</a></span>, being distant from Mount Athos eighty-seven; it is 112 miles in circumference, and has the citiesof Hephæstia and Myrina<span id="ref_47"><a href="#note_47">[47]</a></span>; into the market-place of whichlast city Athos throws its shadow at the summer solstice.The island of Thasos<span id="ref_48"><a href="#note_48">[48]</a></span>, constituting a free state, is six miles<pb n="1325" />distant from Lemnos; it formerly had the name of Aëria,or Æthria. Abdera<span id="ref_49"><a href="#note_49">[49]</a></span>, on the mainland, is distant fromThasos twenty-two miles, Athos sixty-two<span id="ref_50"><a href="#note_50">[50]</a></span>. The island ofSamothrace<span id="ref_51"><a href="#note_51">[51]</a></span>, a free state, facing the river Hebrus, is thesame distance from Thasos, being also thirty-two<span id="ref_52"><a href="#note_52">[52]</a></span> milesfrom Imbros, twenty-two from Lemnos, and thirty-eight<span id="ref_53"><a href="#note_53">[53]</a></span>from the coast of Thrace; it is thirty-two miles in circumference,and in it rises Mount Saoce<span id="ref_54"><a href="#note_54">[54]</a></span>, ten miles in height.This island is the most inaccessible of them all. Callimachusmentions it by its ancient name of Dardania.</p><p>Between the Chersonesus and Samothrace, at a distanceof about fifteen miles from them both, is the island ofHalonnesos<span id="ref_55"><a href="#note_55">[55]</a></span>, and beyond it Gethone, Lamponia, andAlopeconnesus<span id="ref_56"><a href="#note_56">[56]</a></span>, not far from Cœlos, a port<span id="ref_57"><a href="#note_57">[57]</a></span> of theChersonesus,besides some others of no importance. The following namesmay be also mentioned, as those of uninhabited islands inthis gulf, of which we have been enabled to discover thenames:—Desticos, Sarnos, Cyssiros, Charbrusa, Calathusa,Scylla, Draconon, Arconnesus, Diethusa, Scapos, Capheris,Mesate, Æantion, Pateronnesos, Pateria, Calate, Neriphus,and Polendos<span id="ref_58"><a href="#note_58">[58]</a></span>.<pb n="1326" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">So called from lying scattered at random as it were,<foreign lang="greek">spora\s</foreign> "scattered."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Helene is supposed to be the modern Pira; Phacussa, Fecussa;Nicasia, Rachia; Schinussa, Schinusa; and Pholegandros, Policandro.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Nikaria, to the west of Samos. According to tradition, itderived its name from Icarus, the son of Dædalus, who was believed tohave fallen into the sea in its vicinity.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Its length is not so great as is here mentioned by Pliny. Its townswere Drepanum, or Dracanum, Œnoë, and Isti.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The first two names are from the Greek, in allusion to its long,narrow shape, and the last bears reference to the fact of its shoresabounding in fish.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Scyro, east of Eubœa, and one of the Sporades. Here Achilleswas said to have been concealed by his mother Thetis, in woman'sattire.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Nio, one of the Sporades, inaccurately called by Stephanus oneof the Cyclades. The modern town is built on the site of the ancientone, of which there are some remains. It was said that Homer diedhere, on his voyage from Smyrna to Athens, and that his mother,Clymene, was a native of this island. In <date value="1773" authname="1773">1773</date>, Van Krienen, a Dutchnobleman, asserted that he had discovered the tomb of Homer here, withcertain inscriptions relative to him; but they have been generallyregarded by the learned as forgeries. Odia and Oletandros seem not tohave been identified.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called Gioura, or Jura. It was little better than a barren rock,though inhabited; but so notorious for its poverty, that its micewere said to be able to gnaw through iron. It was used as a placeof banishment under the Roman emperors, whence the line of Juvenal,i. 73—<lb />"Aude aliquid brevibus Gyaris et carcere dignum."<lb />"Dare some deed deserving of the little Gyara and the gaol." It is nowuninhabited, except by a few shepherds in the summer.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Telos, or Piskopi, a small island in the Carpathian Sea, and oneof the Sporades. It lies off the coast of Caria. Syrnos appears not tohave been identified.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Near Naxos. Virgil calls it 'viridis,' or 'green,' whichServius explains by the colour of its marble. Like Gyara, it was usedas a placeof banishment under the Roman Empire. In C. 22, Pliny has mentionedCynæthus as one of the names of Delos.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Patmo, one of the Sporades, and west of the Promontory ofPosidium, in Caria. To this place St. John was banished, and here hewrote the Apocalypse.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A group between Icaria and Samos. They are now called Phurniand Krusi.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">One of the Sporades, now Lebitha.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Lero. Its inhabitants were of Milesian origin, and ofindifferent character. In its temple of Artemis, the sisters ofMeleager weresaid to have been changed into guinea-fowls. It was opposite the coastof Caria.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Zinari, N.E. of Amorgos. The artichoke (called <foreign lang="greek">ki/nara</foreign> inGreek) is said to have given name to it.</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Sikino; between Pholegandros and Ios.</p><p><span id="note_17"><a href="#ref_17">17. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">So called, according to Stephanus, from its cultivation of the vineand produce of wine, <foreign lang="greek">oi=/nos.</foreign> It was situate betweenPholegandros and Ios.It was said to have had the name of Sicinus from a son of Thoas andŒnoë. Hieracia seems to be unknown.</p><p><span id="note_18"><a href="#ref_18">18. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Still known by that name, and lying between Carpathus and Crete.The ruins of the ancient town of Casos are still to be seen at the villageof Polin. It is mentioned by Homer.</p><p><span id="note_19"><a href="#ref_19">19. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Kimoli, one of the Cyclades, between Siphnos and Melos. Ittook its name of Echinussa from the 'Echinus,' or Sea-urchin, of whichvarious fossil specimens are still found on the coast; but nowhere else inthese islands, except the opposite coast of Melos. There are considerableruins of its ancient town.</p><p><span id="note_20"><a href="#ref_20">20. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Milo, the most westerly of the Cyclades. It is remarkable forits extreme fertility. Its town, which, according to most authorities,was called Byblis, was situate on the north of the island.</p><p><span id="note_21"><a href="#ref_21">21. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ansart remarks, that our author is mistaken in this assertion, fornot only are many others of these islands more circular in form, buteven that of Kimolo, which stands next to it.</p><p><span id="note_22"><a href="#ref_22">22. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Amorgo, S.E. of Naxos. It was the birth-place of the Iambicpoet Simonides. It is noted for its fertility. Under the Romanemperors, it was used as a place of banishment.</p><p><span id="note_23"><a href="#ref_23">23. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Polybos, or Antimelos, an uninhabited island near Melos.Phyle seems not to have been identified.</p><p><span id="note_24"><a href="#ref_24">24. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Santorin, south of the island of Ios. The tradition was, thatit was formed from a clod of earth, thrown from the ship Argo. It isevidently of volcanic origin, and is covered with pumice-stone. It wascolonized by Lacedæmonians and Minyans of Lemnos, under the SpartanTheras, who gave his name to the island.</p><p><span id="note_25"><a href="#ref_25">25. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A small island to the west of Thera, still known by the same name.</p><p><span id="note_26"><a href="#ref_26">26. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In Lapie's map, Ascania is set down as the present Christiana.</p><p><span id="note_27"><a href="#ref_27">27. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Anaphe, Namfi, or Namphio, one of the Sporades. It wascelebrated for the temple of Apollo Ægletes, the foundation of whichwas ascribed to the Argonauts, and of which considerable remains stillexist. It abounds in partridges, as it did also in ancient times.</p><p><span id="note_28"><a href="#ref_28">28. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Astropalea, or Stamphalia. By Strabo it is called one of theSporades, by Stephanus one of the Cyclades. It probably was favouredby the Romans for the excellence and importance of its harbours. FromHegesander we learn that it was famous for its hares, and Pliny tells us,in B. viii. c. 59, that its mussels were (as they still are) verycelebrated.</p><p><span id="note_29"><a href="#ref_29">29. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">None of these islands can be now identified, except perhaps Chalcia,also mentioned by Strabo, and now known as Karki.</p><p><span id="note_30"><a href="#ref_30">30. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Kalymno, the principal island of the group, by Homer calledCalydne. According to most of the editions, Pliny mentions hereCalydna and Calymna, making this island, which had those two names, intotwo islands. Although Pliny here mentions only the town of Coös, still,in B. v. c. 36, he speaks of three others, Notium, Nisyrus, andMendeterus. There are still some remains of antiquity to be seenhere.</p><p><span id="note_31"><a href="#ref_31">31. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or Carpathus, now Skarpanto. It gave name to the sea betweenCrete and Rhodes.</p><p><span id="note_32"><a href="#ref_32">32. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It still preserves its ancient name, and presents some interestingremains of antiquity.</p><p><span id="note_33"><a href="#ref_33">33. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Brotier says that the distance is really fifty-two miles.</p><p><span id="note_34"><a href="#ref_34">34. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">So called from the town of Petalia, on the mainland. Ansart saysthat their present name is Spili.</p><p><span id="note_35"><a href="#ref_35">35. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Talanti, giving name to the Channel of Talanti.</p><p><span id="note_36"><a href="#ref_36">36. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The present Gulf of Volo, mentioned in C. 15 of the present Book.</p><p><span id="note_37"><a href="#ref_37">37. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ansart suggests that this may possibly be the small island nowcalled Agios Nicolaos.</p><p><span id="note_38"><a href="#ref_38">38. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Trikeri.</p><p><span id="note_39"><a href="#ref_39">39. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In the present Chapter.</p><p><span id="note_40"><a href="#ref_40">40. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Seangero, or Skantzoura, according to Ansart.</p><p><span id="note_41"><a href="#ref_41">41. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now the Gulf of Saloniki, mentioned in C. 17. The islands herementioned have apparently not been identified.</p><p><span id="note_42"><a href="#ref_42">42. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Off the coast of Thessaly, now Piperi.</p><p><span id="note_43"><a href="#ref_43">43. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Skiathos. It was famous for its wine.</p><p><span id="note_44"><a href="#ref_44">44. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called Embro, or Imru. Both the island and city of Imbrosare mentioned by Homer.</p><p><span id="note_45"><a href="#ref_45">45. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is double the actual circumference of the island.</p><p><span id="note_46"><a href="#ref_46">46. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called Stalimene.</p><p><span id="note_47"><a href="#ref_47">47. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Its site is now called Palæo Kastro.
