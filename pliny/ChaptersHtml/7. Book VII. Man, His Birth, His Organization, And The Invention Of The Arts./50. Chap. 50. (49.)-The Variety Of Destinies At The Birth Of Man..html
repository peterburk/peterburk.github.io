<div2 type="chapter" n="50" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 50. (49.)ÑTHE VARIETY OF DESTINIES AT THE BIRTH OF MAN.</head><p>The present conjuncture would appear to demand from me<pb n="2204" />some opinion upon the science of the stars. Epigenes<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> usedto maintain that human life could not be possibly prolonged toone hundred and twelve years, and Berosus<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> that it couldexceed one hundred and seventeen. The system is still inexistence which Petosiris and Necepsos<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> transmitted to us,and called by them "tartemorion,"<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> from the division of thesigns into four portions; from which it would appear, that life,in the region of Italy, may possibly be extended to one hundred and twenty-four years They maintain that, reckoningfrom the commencement of an ascending sign, no life can possibly exceed a period of ninety degrees from that point; whichperiods they call by the name of "anaphor¾;"<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> they say also,that these anaphor¾ may be intercepted by meeting with malign stars or their rays even, or those of the sun.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> To theirsthe school of ®sculapius succeeded, which admits that the allotted duration of life is regulated by the stars, but that it isquite uncertain what is the greatest extent of the period.These say that long life is uncommon, because a very great number of persons are born at critical moments in the hours of thelunar days; for example, in the seventh and the fifteenthhours, both by day and night; these individuals are subjectto the malign influence of that ascending scale of the yearswhich is termed the "climacteric,"<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> and never hardly, whenborn under these circumstances, exceed the fifty-fourth year.<pb n="2205" /></p><p>First of all, however, it must strike us that the variationswhich have taken place in this science prove its uncertainty;and to this consideration may be added the experience of thevery last census, which was made four years ago, under thedirection of the Emperors Vespasian, father and son.<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> I shallnot search through the registers;<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> I shall only cite some instances in the middle district that lies between the Apenninesand the river Padus. At Parma, three persons declared themselves to be one hundred and twenty years of age; at Brixellum,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> one was one hundred and twenty-five; at Parma, twowere one hundred and thirty; at Placentia, one was one hundred and thirty; at Faventia, one woman was one hundred andthirty-two; at Bononia, L. Terentius, the son of Marcus,and at Ariminum, M. Aponius, were one hundred and forty,and Tertulla, one hundred and thirty-seven. In the hillswhich lie around Placentia is the town of Veleiacium,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> inwhich six persons gave in their ages as one hundred and tenyears, and four one hundred and twenty, while one person, M.Mucius, the son of Marcus, surnamed Felix, and of the Galeriantribe,<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> was aged one hundred and forty. Not, however, todwell upon what is generally admitted, in the eighth region ofItaly, there appeared by the register, to be fifty-four persons of<pb n="2206" />one hundred years of age, fourteen of one hundred and ten, twoof one hundred and twenty-five, four of one hundred andthirty, the same number of one hundred and thirty-five to onehundred and thirty-seven, and three of one hundred and forty.</p><p>Again, we have another illustration of the uncertain tenureof human life. Homer informs us that Hector and Polydamas<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> were born on the same night,<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> and yet how differentwas their fate! M. C¾lius Rufus<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> and C. Licinius Calvuswere born on the same day, the fifth before the calends of June,in the consulship of C. Marius and Cn. Carbo; they both ofthem lived to be orators, it is true, but how different theirdestiny! The same thing, too, happens every day, and in everypart of the world, with respect to men that are born in theself-same hour; masters and slaves, kings and beggars, comeinto the world at the same moment.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We have an account of Epigenes, by Hardouin, Lemaire, vol. i.pp. 86, 87, where he is designated Rhodius.

Firmicus for an explanation of the differencewhich may exist in the length of the lives of individuals as depending ontheir natal day; Lemaire, vol. iii. p. 186. It appears to have been one ofthe leading tenets of the astrologers, that the favourable influence of theascending sign is diminished or counteracted by the rays of other planets,or of the sun, falling upon the sign in certain directions or at certainangles, and that the length of the life of the individual is shortened in proportion to this injurious effect.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This term means, literally, "increasing by a regular scale," or, "ac-cording to a proportional series of numbers;" the multiples of 7 havebeen generally supposed to be the critical periods of human life, and, moreespecially, 63, or 9 times 7, which was accordingly termed "the grandclimacteric."ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This census appears to have taken place A.D. <date value="74" authname="74">74</date>, under the fifth consulship of Vespasian, and the third of Titus; according to Censorinus, itwas the last of which we have any distinct account.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Vasaria;" it is said, by the commentators, to be a term of Germanorigin, derived from a word which signified the bark of a tree. It does notappear, however, from what cause it was appropriated to the sense in whichit is used by Pliny. The word is found in Cicero's oration against Piso,sec. 35; but is there applied to a totally different object.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Brigella or Brescella.

Filius, Galeria, Felix." It has been doubted bythe commentators, whether the word Galeria refers to the name of the mother of Mucius, or to the tribe to which he belonged. The latter is, perhaps,the more natural interpretation. Hardouin and Ajasson, however, adoptthe opinion, that Galeria was the mother of Marcus; Lemaire, vol. iii.pp. 191,192. We meet with a precisely similar construction of words inCicero, 9th Philip. sec. 7; "Ser. Sulpicius, Q. Filius, Lemonia Rufus."ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The son of Panthšus, and friend of Hector.

Lentulus Spinther and L. Metellus Nepos, and wasoppressed by Clodius. Pliny refers to C¾lius, and his accusation of Calpurnius, in a subsequent passage, B. xxvii. c. 2.ÑB. Licinius CalvusMacer was by some considered, as an orator, to rival even Cicero himself;and as a poet, is generally mentioned by the side of Catullus. He exhaustedhis constitution by his severe application, and died in his thirty-fifthor thirty-sixth year. He was remarkable for the extreme shortness of hisstature. C¾lius was a partisan of Pompey, and was eventually put todeath at Thurii.</p></body>
