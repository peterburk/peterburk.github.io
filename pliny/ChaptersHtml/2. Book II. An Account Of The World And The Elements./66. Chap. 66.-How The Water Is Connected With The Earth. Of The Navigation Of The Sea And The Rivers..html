<div2 type="chapter" n="66" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 66.—How THE WATER IS CONNECTED WITH THE EARTH.OF THE NAVIGATION OF THE SEA AND THE RIVERS.</head><p>We must believe, that the great artist, Nature, has soarranged it, that as the arid and dry earth cannot subsist byitself and without moisture, nor, on the other hand, can thewater subsist unless it be supported by the earth, they areconnected by a mutual union. The earth opens her harbours,while the water pervades the whole earth, within, without,and above; its veins running in all directions, like connecting links, and bursting out on even the highest ridges;where, forced up by the air, and pressed out by the weightof the earth, it shoots forth as from a pipe, and is so far frombeing in danger of falling, that it bounds up to the highestand most lofty places. Hence the reason is obvious, whythe seas are not increased by the daily accession of so manyrivers<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>.</p><p>(66.) The earth has, therefore, the whole of its globe girt,on every side, by the sea flowing round it. And this is not a<pb n="1098" />point to be investigated by arguments, but what has beenascertained by experience.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Alexandre remarks on this passage, "Nempe quod remotissimos etiamfontes alat oceanus. Sed omittit Plinius vaporationis intermedia opehoc fieri." Lemaire, i. 376. Aristotle has written at considerable lengthon the origin of springs, in his Meteor. i. 13. p. 543 <hi rend="ital">et seq.</hi> He arguesagainst the opinion of those who suppose that the water of springs isentirely derived from evaporation. Seneca's account of the origin ofsprings is found in his Nat. Quæst. iii. 1.</p></body>
