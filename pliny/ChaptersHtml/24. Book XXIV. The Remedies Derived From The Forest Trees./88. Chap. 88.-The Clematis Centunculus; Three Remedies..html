Bythe Greeks it is known as the "clematis," Taken in astringent wine it is wonderfully effectual for arresting<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> diarrhœa:beaten up, in doses of one denarius, in five cyathi of oxymelor of warm water, it arrests hæmorrhage, and facilitates theafter-birth.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Turner and C. Bauhin identify it with the Gnaphalium Germanicumof Lamarck, and Sprengel with the Polygonum convolvulus of Linnæus.If so, Fée says, the synonym here given by Pliny is erroneous; for theGreek clematis, there can be little doubt, is the Clematis cirrhosa of Lin-næus. See the account given of the Gnaphalion in B. xxvii. c. 61.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">All that Pliny states as to its medicinal properties, Fée says, iserroneous.</p></body>
