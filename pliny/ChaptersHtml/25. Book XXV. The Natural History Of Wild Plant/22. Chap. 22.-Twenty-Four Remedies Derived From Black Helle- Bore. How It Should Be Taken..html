<div2 type="chapter" n="22" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 22.—TWENTY-FOUR REMEDIES DERIVED FROM BLACK HELLE-BORE. HOW IT SHOULD BE TAKEN.</head><p>Black hellebore is administered for the cure of paralysis,insanity, dropsy—provided there is no fever—chronic gout,and diseases of the joints: it has the effect too, of carrying<pb n="5099" />off the bilious secretions and morbid humours by stool. It isgiven also in water as a gentle aperient, the proportion beingone drachma at the very utmost, and four oboli for a moderatedose. Some authorities have recommended mixing scammonywith it, but salt is looked upon as more safe. If given in anyconsiderable quantity in combination with a sweet substance,it is highly dangerous: used in the form of a fomentation, itdisperses films upon the eyes; and hence it is that some medicalmen have pounded it and used it for an eye-salve. It ripensand acts detergently upon scrofulous sores, suppurations, andindurated tumours, as also upon fistulas, but in this latter caseit must be removed at the end of a couple of days. In combination with copper filings<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and sandarach, it removes warts;and it is applied to the abdominal regions, with barley-mealand wine, in cases of dropsy.</p><p>This plant is employed for the cure of pituitous defluxionsin cattle and beasts of burden, a slip of it being passed<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>through the ear, and removed at the same hour on the fol-lowing day. With frankincense also, wax, and pitch, or elsepisselæon,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> it is used for the cure of itch in quadrupeds.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Squama sens."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See a similar statement as to Consiligo, in B. xxvi. c. 21.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xv. c. 7, and B. xxiv. c. 11.</p></body>
