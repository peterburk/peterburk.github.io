The sea-mouse<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> digs a hole in the earth,deposits its eggs there, and then covers them up.

This fish, Cuvier says, and ingeneral all of the same genus, has a channel situate under the tail, whichis opened by two moveable valves.

This circumstance, he says,gave rise to the notion mentioned in the text.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Mentioned in c. 35 of the present Book.
