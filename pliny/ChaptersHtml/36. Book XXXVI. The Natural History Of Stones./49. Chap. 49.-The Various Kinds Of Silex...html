There is a green silex, also, which offers a mostpowerful resistance to the action of fire, but is never found inany large quantities, and, in all cases, in an isolated form, andnot as a constituent part of solid rock. Of the other kinds,the pale silex is but rarely used for erections: being of globularform, it is not liable to injury, but at the same time it isinsecure for building purposes, unless it is well braced andtightly held together. Nor yet does river silex offer anygreater security, for it always has the appearance of beingwet.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A general name for Silica, Flint, or Quartz, and the several varieties.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. iii. c. 8.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. ii. c. 96, B. iii. c. 9, and B. xiv. c. 8.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ajasson thinks that Travertine is meant; a tufa, or carbonate of lime,which is common in Tuscany.</p></body>
