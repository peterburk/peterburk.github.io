Some medical men prescribe three roots of plantago, in three cyathi of water; andin a similar manner, four roots for quartan fevers. Whenbuglossos<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> is beginning to wither, if a person takes the pith outof the stem, and says while so doing, that it is for the cureof such and such a person suffering from fever, and thenattaches seven leaves to the patient, just before the paroxysmscome on, he will experience a cure, they say.</p><p>Fevers too, those which are attended with recurrent coldshiverings more particularly, are cured by administering onedrachma of betony, or else agaric, in three cyathi of hydromel.Some medical men recommend three leaves of cinquefoil fortertian, four for quartan, and an increased number for otherfevers; while others again prescribe in all cases three oboli ofcinquefoil, with pepper, in hydromel.</p><p>Vervain, administered in water, is curative of fever, in beasts<pb n="5198" />of burden even; but care must be taken, in cases of tertianfever, to cut the plant at the third joint, and of quartan feverat the fourth. The seed of either kind of hypericons<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> is takenalso for quartan fevers and cold shiverings.
