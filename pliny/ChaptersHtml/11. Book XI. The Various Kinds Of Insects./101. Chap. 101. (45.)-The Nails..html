All animals which have fingers have nails aswell. In the ape they are long and overlapping,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> like a tile,while in man they are broad: they will grow even after death.In the beasts of prey they are hooked, while in others, suchas the dog, for instance, they are straight, with the exception,indeed, of the one which is attached to the leg in most ofthem. All the animals which have feet [and not hoofs], havetoes as well, except the elephant; he, also, would appear tohave toes, five in number, but rudely developed, undivided,and hardly distinct from one another, bearing a nearer resem-blance, in fact, to hoofs than to claws. In the elephant thefore-feet are the largest, and in the hind-feet there are shortjoints. This animal is able, also, to bend the hams inwardlike a man, while in all the others the joints of the hinderlegs bend in a contrary direction to those of the fore ones.Those animals which are viviparous bend the fore-leg forward,while the joint of the hind-leg is directed backward.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This seems to be the meaning of "imbricatus."</p></body>
