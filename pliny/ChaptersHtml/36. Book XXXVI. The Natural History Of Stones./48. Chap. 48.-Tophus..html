Still, however,there are some localities which have no other, Carthage,in Africa, for example. It is eaten away by the emanationsfrom the sea, crumbled to dust by the wind, and shattered bythe pelting of the rain: but human industry has found themeans of protecting walls of houses built of it, with a coating ofpitch, as a plaster of lime would corrode it. Hence it is,that we have the well-known saying, "that the Carthaginiansuse pitch<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> for their houses and lime<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> for their wines," thislast being the method used by them in the preparation of theirmust.</p><p>In the territories of Fidenæ and Alba, in the vicinity ofRome, we find other soft kinds of stone; and, in Umbria andVenetia, there is a stone<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> which admits of being cut with theteeth of a saw. These stones are easy to be worked, and arecapable of supporting a considerable weight, if they are onlykept sheltered from the weather. Rain, however, frost, and dew,split them to pieces, nor can they resist the humidity of thesea-air. The stone<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> of Tibur can stand everything exceptheat, which makes it crack.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Identical, probably, with the Tufa of modern Mineralogy, whichthence derives its name, a Carbonate of lime.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Thus reversing the order of things with the Romans, who put thelime on their houses, and the pitch in their wines.
