<div2 type="chapter" n="32" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 32. (17.)ÑTHE LOTUS.</head><p>Africa, too, at least that part of it which looks towardsour shores, produces a remarkable tree, the lotus,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> by someknown as the "celtis," which has also been naturalized in Italy,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>though it has been somewhat modified by the change of soil.The finest quality of lotus is that found in the vicinity of theSyrtes and among the Nasamones. It is the same size as thepear-tree, although Cornelius Nepos states to the effect that itis but short. The leaves have numerous incisions, just as withthose of the holm-oak. There are many varieties of the lotus,which are characterized more particularly by the difference intheir respective fruits. The fruit is of about the size of abean, and its colour is that of saffron, though before it is ripeit is continually changing its tints, like the grape. It hasbranches thickly set with leaves, like the myrtle, and not,as with us in Italy, like the cherry. In the country towhich this tree is indigenous, the fruit of it is so remarkablysweet and luscious, that it has even given its name to a wholeterritory, and to a nation<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> who, by their singular hospitality,have even seduced strangers who have come among them, tolose all remembrance of their native country. It is said also,that those who eat this fruit are subject to no maladies of thestomach. The fruit which has no stone in the inside is thebest: this stone in the other kind seems to be of an osseousnature. A wine is also extracted from this fruit very similar<pb n="3199" />to honied wine; according to Nepos, however, it will not lastabove ten days; he states also that the berries are chopped upwith alica,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and then put away in casks for the table. Indeed, we read that armies have been fed upon this food whenmarching to and fro through the territory of Africa. Thewood is of a black colour, and is held in high esteem for makingflutes; from the root also they manufacture handles for knives,and various other small articles.</p><p>Such is the nature of the tree that is so called in Africa; thesame name being also given to a certain<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> herb, and to a stalk<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>that grows in Egypt belonging to the marsh plants. This lastplant springs up when the waters of the Nile have retired afterits overflow: its stalk is similar to that of the bean, and itsleaves are numerous and grow in thick clusters, but are shorterand more slender than those of the bean. The fruit grows onthe head of the plant, and is similar in appearance to a poppyin its indentations<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> and all its other characteristics; withinthere are small grains, similar to those of millet.<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> The inhabitants lay these heads in large heaps, and there let themrot, after which they separate the grain from the residue bywashing, and then dry it; when this is done they pound it,and then use it as flour for making a kind of bread. What isstated in addition to these particulars, is a very singular<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> fact;it is said that when the sun sets, these poppy-heads shut andcover themselves in the leaves, and at sun-rise they openagain; an alternation which continues until the fruit is perfectly ripe, and the flower, which is white, falls off.</p><p>(18.) Even more than this, of the lotus of the Euphrates,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>it is said that the head and flower of the plant, at nightfall,sink into the water, and there remain till midnight, so deep inthe water, that on thrusting in one's arm, the head cannot bereached: after midnight it commences to return upwards, andgradually becomes more and more erect till sunrise, when it<pb n="3200" />emerges entirely from the water and opens its flower; afterwhich it still continues to rise, until at last it is to be seenraised quite aloft, high above the level of the water. Thislotus has a root about the size of a quince, enveloped in a blackskin, similar to that with which the chesnut is covered. Thesubstance that lies within this skin is white, and forms verypleasant food, but is better cooked, either in water or uponhot ashes, then in a raw state. Swine fatten upon nothingbetter than the peelings of this root.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Rhamnus lotus of Linn¾us; the Zizyphus lotus of Desfontaines.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Celtis australis of Linn¾us.
