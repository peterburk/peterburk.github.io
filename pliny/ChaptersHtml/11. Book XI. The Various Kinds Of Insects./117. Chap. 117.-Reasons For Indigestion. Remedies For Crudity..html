Anaccumulation of flavours is injurious, and still more so, ifheightened by sauces. All acrid elements are difficult of digestion, and the same is the case if food is devoured greedily,or in too large quantities. Food is also less easily digested insummer than in winter, and in old age than in youth. Thevomits which man has invented, by way of remedy for thisevil, render the body more cold, and are more particularly injurious to the eyes and teeth.</p></div2></body>
