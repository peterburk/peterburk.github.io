<div2 type="chapter" n="45" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 45.—MADDENING HONEY.</head><p>In the country of the Sanni, in the same part of Pontus,there is another kind of honey, which, from the madness itproduces, has received the name of "mænomenon."<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> Thisevil effect is generally attributed to the flowers of the rhododendron,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> with which the woods there abound; and that people,though it pays a tribute to the Romans in wax, derives noprofit whatever from its honey, in consequence of these dangerous properties. In Persis, too, and in Gætulia, a district<pb n="4343" />of Mauritania Cœsariensis, bordering on the country of theMassæsyli, there are poisonous honeycombs found; and some,too, only partly so,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> one of the most insidious things thatpossibly could happen, were it not that the livid colour of thehoney gives timely notice of its noxious qualities. What canwe suppose to have possibly been the intention of Nature inthus laying these traps in our way, giving us honey that ispoisonous in some years and good in others, poisonous in someparts of the combs and not in others, and that, too, the producein all cases of the self-same bees? It was not enough, forsooth,to have produced a substance in which poison might be administered without the slightest difficulty, but must she herselfadminister it as well in the honey, to fall in the way of somany animated beings? What, in fact, can have been hermotive, except to render mankind a little more cautious andsomewhat less greedy?</p><p>And has she not provided the very bees, too, with pointedweapons, and those weapons poisoned to boot? So it is, andI shall, therefore, without delay, set forth the remedies tocounteract the effects of their stings. It will be found a veryexcellent plan to foment the part stung with the juice of mallows<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> or of ivy leaves, or else for the person who has been stungto take these juices in drink. It is a very astonishing thing,however, that the insects which thus carry these poisons intheir mouths and secrete them, should never die themselvesin consequence; unless it is that Nature, that mistress of allthings, has given to bees the same immunity from the effectsof poison which she has granted against the attacks of serpentsto the Psylli<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> and the Marsi among men.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot"><foreign lang="greek">Maino/menon,</foreign> "maddening."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The ægolethron of the preceding Chapter, Fée thinks.
