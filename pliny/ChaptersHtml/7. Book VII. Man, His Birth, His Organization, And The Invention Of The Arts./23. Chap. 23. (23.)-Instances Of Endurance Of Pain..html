(23.)ÑINSTANCES OF ENDURANCE OF PAIN.</head><p>Of patience in enduring pain, that being too frequently thelot of our calamitous fate, we have innumerable instances related. One of the most remarkable instances among the femalesex is that of the courtesan Le¾na, who, although put to thetorture, refused to betray the tyrant-slayers, Harmodius andAristogiton.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> Among those of men, we have that of Anaxarchus, who, when put to the torture for a similar reason, bitoff his tongue and spit it into the face of the tyrant, thusdestroying the only hope<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> of his making any betrayal.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This circumstance is mentioned by Pausanias, in his Attica. She wasan Athenian het¾ra, or courtesan, beloved by Aristogiton, or, according toAthen¾us, by Harmodius. On the murder of Hipparchus, the son of Pisistratus, she was put to the torture, being supposed to have been privyto the conspiracy; but she died under her sufferings without making anydisclosure, and, according to one account, bit off her tongue, that no secretmight be betrayed by her. The Athenians erected in her honour a bronzestatue of a lioness (in reference to her name), without a tongue, in thevestibule of the Acropolis.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This story is related by Val. Maximus, B. iii. c. 3, it is also alludedto by Cicero, Tus. Qu¾st. B. ii. c. 22, and De Nat. Deor. B. ii. c. 33; buthe only speaks of his tortures, without mentioning what Pliny states of hisbiting off his tongue.ÑB. He was a philosopher of Abdera, of the schoolof Democritus, and flourished about B.C. <date value="-340" authname="-340">340</date>. Towards Alexander theGreat, whom he accompanied into Asia, he acted the part of a baseflatterer. He was pounded to death in a mortar, by order of Nicocreon,king of Cyprus.</p></body>
