<div2 type="chapter" n="15" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 15. (15.)—THE ANIMALS OF SCYTHIA; THE BISON.</head><p>Scythia produces but very few animals, in consequence ofthe scarcity of shrubs. Germany, which lies close adjoiningit, has not many animals, though it has some very fine kindsof wild oxen: the bison, which has a mane, and the urus,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span><pb n="2263" />possessed of remarkable strength and swiftness. To these, thevulgar, in their ignorance, have given the name of bubalus<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>whereas, that animal is really produced in Africa, and ratherbears a resemblance to the calf and the stag.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier remarks upon the two animals here mentioned, the bison andthe urus, that Europe, at the present time, contains only one species of wildox, the bison, or aurochs of the Germans, which still exists, although insmall numbers only, in the forests of Lithuania. There are, however, fossilremains, in different parts of the north of Europe, of other animals of thesame genus, which may have been the urus of Pliny, and not extinct whenhe wrote. Ajasson, vol. vi. pp. 413, 414; Lemaire, vol. iii. p. 365. Thedescription by Cæsar of the urus of Gaul, Bell. Gall. B. vi. c. 26, seemsto agree with the remains of the fossil animal, and may, therefore, be con-sidered as confirming the opinion, that both animals were in existence whenPliny wrote.—B.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This appears to have been a species of antelope, the Antelope bubalusof Linnæus. Cuvier observes, that Strabo places it among the gazelles,and Aristotle associates it with the stag and the deer, while Oppian's description of the urus, agrees with those of the gazelle.—B.</p></body>
