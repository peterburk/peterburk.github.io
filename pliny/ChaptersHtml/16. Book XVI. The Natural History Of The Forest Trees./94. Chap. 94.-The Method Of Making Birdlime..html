They are then dried,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> andwhen brought to a state of perfect aridity, are first pounded,and then put in water, in which they are left to rot for twelvedays; this being, in fact, the only thing that finds improve-ment in decay. After this, they are again beaten in runningwater with a mallet, and after losing the outer coat there isonly the viscous inner pulp remaining. This substance isbirdlime; and after it has been thinned by the addition ofwalnut oil, it is found particularly useful for catching birds,it being quite sufficient if they only touch it with the wings.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The method used in Italy for making bird-lime is very similar at thepresent day.</p></body>
