<div2 type="chapter" n="61" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 61. (40.)—THE QUALITIES OF THE DOG; EXAMPLES OF TS ATTACHMENT TO ITS MASTER; NATIONS WHICH HAVE KEPT DOGS FOR THE PURPOSES OF WAR.</head><p>Among the animals, also, that are domesticated with mankind,there are many circumstances that are far from undeservingof being known: among these, there are more particularlythat most faithful friend of man, the dog, and the horse. Wehave an account of a dog that fought against a band of robbers,in defending its master; and although it was pierced withwounds, still it would not leave the body, from which it droveaway all birds and beasts. Another dog, again, in Epirus,recognized the murderer of its master, in the midst of an assemblage of people, and, by biting and barking at him, extorted from him a confession of his crime. A king of theGaramantes also was brought back from exile by two hundreddogs, which maintained the combat against all his opponents.The people of Colophon<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and Castabala<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> kept troops of dogs,for the purposes of war; and these used to fight in the frontrank, and never retreat; they were the most faithful of auxiliaries, and yet required no pay. After the defeat of theCimbri, their dogs defended their moveable houses, which werecarried upon waggons. Jason, the Lycian, having been slain,<pb n="2313" />his dog refused to take food, and died of famine. A dog, towhich Darius gives the name of Hyrcanus, upon the funeralpile of King Lysimachus being lighted, threw itself into theflames,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and the dog of King Hiero did the same. Philistusalso gives a similar account of Pyrrhus, the dog of the tyrantGelon: and it is said, also, that the dog of Nicomedes, king ofBithynia, tore Consingis,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> the wife of that king, in consequenceof her wanton behaviour, when toying with her husband.</p><p>Among ourselves, Volcatius, a man of rank, who instructedCascellius in the civil law,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> as he was riding on his Asturianjennet, towards evening, from his country-house, was attackedby a robber, and was only saved by his dog. The senatorCælius,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> too, while lying sick at Placentia, was surprised byarmed men, but received not a wound from them until theyhad first killed his dog. But a more extraordinary fact thanall, is what took place in our own times, and is testified by thepublic register of the Roman people. In the consulship ofAppius Junius and P. Silius, when Titius Sabinus<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> was put to<pb n="2314" />death, together with his slaves, for the affair of Nero, the son ofGermanicus, it was found impossible to drive away a dog whichbelonged to one of them from the prison; nor could it be forcedaway from the body, which had been cast down the Gemitoriansteps;<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> but there it stood howling, in the presence of vastmultitudes of people; and when some one threw a piece of breadto it, the animal carried it to the mouth of its master. Afterwards, when the body was thrown into the Tiber, the dogswam into the river, and endeavoured to raise it out of thewater; quite a throng of people being collected to witness thisinstance of an animal's fidelity.</p><p>Dogs are the only animals that are sure to know their masters;and if they suddenly meet him as a stranger, they will instantlyrecognize him. They are the only animals that will answerto their names, and recognize the voices of the family. Theyrecollect a road along which they have passed, however longit may be. Next to man, there is no living creature whosememory is so retentive. By sitting down on the ground, wemay arrest their most impetuous attack, even when promptedby the most violent rage.</p><p>In daily life we have discovered many other valuable qualities in this animal; but its intelligence and sagacity are moreespecially shown in the chase. It discovers and traces out thetracks of the animal, leading by the leash<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> the sportsman whoaccompanies it straight up to the prey; and as soon as ever ithas perceived it, how silent it is, and how secret but significantis the indication which it gives, first by the tail and afterwardsby the nose!<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> Hence it is, that even when worn out withold age, blind, and feeble, they are carried by the huntsmanin his arms, being still able to point out the coverts wherethe game is concealed, by snuffing with their muzzles at thewind. The Indians raise a breed between the dog and thetiger,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> and for this purpose tie up the females in the forests<pb n="2315" />when in heat. The first two litters they look upon as too savageto be reared, but they bring up the third.</p><p>The Gauls do the same with the wolf and the dog;<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> andtheir packs of hounds have, each of them, one of these dogs,which acts as their guide and leader. This dog they followin the chase, and him they carefully obey; for these animalshave even a notion of subordination among themselves. It isasserted that the dogs keep running when they drink at theNile, for fear of becoming a prey to the voracity of thecrocodile.<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> When Alexander the Great was on his Indianexpedition, he was presented by the king of Albania with adog of unusual size; being greatly delighted with its nobleappearance, he ordered bears, and after them wild boars, andthen deer, to be let loose before it; but the dog lay down, andregarded them with a kind of immoveable contempt. Thenoble spirit of the general became irritated by the sluggishness thus manifested by an animal of such vast bulk, and heordered it to be killed. The report of this reached the king,who accordingly sent another dog, and at the same time sentword that its powers were to be tried, not upon small animals,but upon the lion or the elephant; adding, that he had hadoriginally but two, and that if this one were put to death, therace would be extinct. Alexander, without delay, procured alion, which in his presence was instantly torn to pieces. Hethen ordered an elephant to be brought, and never was hemore delighted with any spectacle; for the dog, bristling upits hair all over the body, began by thundering forth a loudbarking, and then attacked the animal, leaping at it first onone side and then on the other, attacking it in the most skilfulmanner, and then again retreating at the opportune moment,until at last the elephant, being rendered quite giddy by turning round and round, fell to the earth, and made it quite reecho with his fall.<pb n="2316" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. v. c. 31.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. v. c. 22, and B. vi. c. 3.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This anecdote is referred to by Ælian, Anim.

Cascellius was an eminent Roman jurist, but nothing seems to beknown of his preceptor, Volcatius, whose prænomen is thought to have beenMucius. Cascellius was noted for his great eloquence and his stern republican principles; and of Cæsar's conduct and government he spoke withthe greatest freedom. He never advanced in civic honours beyond thequæstorship, though he was offered the consulship by Augustus; which hedeclined. He is frequently quoted in the Digest. Horace, in his Art ofPoetry, 11. 371, 372, pays a compliment to the legal reputation ofCascellius, who is also mentioned by Valerius Maximus and Macrobius.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From Ælian, Hist.
