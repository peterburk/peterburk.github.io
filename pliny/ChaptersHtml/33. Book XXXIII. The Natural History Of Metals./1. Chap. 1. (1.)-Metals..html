In oneplace, for instance, we undermine it for the purpose of obtainingriches, to supply the exigencies of life, searching for eithergold or silver, electrum<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> or copper.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> In another place, tosatisfy the requirements of luxury, our researches extend togems and pigments, with which to adorn our fingers<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and thewalls of our houses: while in a third place, we gratify ourrash propensities by a search for iron, which, amid wars andcarnage, is deemed more acceptable even than gold. We traceout all the veins of the earth, and yet, living upon it, underminedas it is beneath our feet, are astonished that it should occasionallycleave asunder or tremble: as though, forsooth, these<pb n="6069" />signs could be any other than expressions of the indignationfelt by our sacred parent! We penetrate into her entrails, andseek for treasures in the abodes even of the Manes,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> as thougheach spot we tread upon were not sufficiently bounteous andfertile for us!</p><p>And yet, amid all this, we are far from making remedies theobject of our researches: and how few in thus delving into theearth have in view the promotion of medicinal knowledge! Forit is upon her surface, in fact, that she has presented us withthese substances, equally with the cereals, bounteous and everready, as she is, in supplying us with all things for our benefit!It is what is concealed from our view, what is sunk far beneathher surface, objects, in fact, of no rapid formation,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> thaturge us to our ruin, that send us to the very depths of hell.As the mind ranges in vague speculation, let us only consider,proceeding through all ages, as these operations are, when willbe the end of thus exhausting the earth, and to what pointwill avarice finally penetrate! How innocent, how happy, howtruly delightful even would life be, if we were to desire nothingbut what is to be found upon the face of the earth; in aword, nothing but what is provided ready to our hands!</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Ips¾ opes." The metals were looked upon by the ancients as theonly <hi rend="ital">true</hi> riches. It is in this sense that Ovid says, Metam. B. i.: "Effodiunturopes, irritamenta malorum." Pliny applies the term "pretia rerum"to metals, as forming the unit of value.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Electrum is described in c. 23, as gold mixed with a certain quantityof silver.

According to the analysis of Klaproth, theÏs of the ancients, when employed in works of art, cutting instruments,statues, vases, &amp;c., was the "bronze" of the moderns, a mixture of copperand tin, in which the proportion of tin varied, from a little more than 2to 1.14 per cent. according as the object was to procure a flexible or ahard substance. Agricola speaks of "¾s" as synonymous with "cuprum,"and Pliny will be found several times in the present Book, speaking of"¾s Cyprium," meaning probably the finest kind of copper, and that withoutalloy.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny has already referred to this topic in B. ii. c. 63.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or shades below.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Illa qu¾ non nascuntur repente."</p></body>
