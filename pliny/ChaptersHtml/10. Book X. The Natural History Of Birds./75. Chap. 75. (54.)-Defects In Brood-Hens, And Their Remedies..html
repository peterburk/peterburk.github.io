(54.)ÑDEFECTS IN BROOD-HENS, AND THEIR REMEDIES.</head><p>Those eggs which have been laid within the last ten days, arethe best for putting under the hen; old ones, or those whichhave just been laid, will be unfruitful; an uneven number<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>also ought to be placed. On the fourth day after the hen hasbegun to sit, if, upon taking an egg with one hand by the twoends and holding it up to the light, it is found to be clear andof one uniform colour, it is most likely to be barren, and another should be substituted in its place. There is also a wayof testing them by means of water; an empty egg will floaton the surface, while those that fall to the bottom, or, in otherwords, are full, should be placed under the hen. Care mustbe taken, however, not to make trial by shaking them, for ifthe organs which are necessary for life become confused, theywill come to nothing.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> Incubation ought to begin just afterthe new moon; for, if commenced before, the eggs will be unproductive. The chickens are hatched sooner if the weatheris warm: hence it is that in summer they break the shell onthe nineteenth day, but in winter on the twenty-fifth only.If it happens to thunder during the time of incubation, theeggs are addled, and if the cry of a hawk is heard they arespoilt. The best remedy against the effects of thunder, is toput an iron nail beneath the straw on which the eggs are laid,or else some earth from off a ploughshare. Some eggs, however, are hatched by the spontaneous action of Nature, withoutthe process of incubation, as is the case in the dung-hills ofEgypt. There is a well-known story related about a man atSyracuse, who was in the habit of covering eggs with earth,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>and then continuing his drinking bout till they were hatched.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">To secure their being more equably covered.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or rather, will produce chickens hideously deformed.
