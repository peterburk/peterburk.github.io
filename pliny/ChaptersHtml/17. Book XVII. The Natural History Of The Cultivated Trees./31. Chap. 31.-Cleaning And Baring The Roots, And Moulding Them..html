These trenches, however, in a moist,watery soil, should be neither wide nor deep; while the contrary is the case where the ground is hot and dry; it being theobject, in the latter instance, to let them receive and retain asmuch water as possible. This rule is applicable to the cultureof old trees as well; for in very hot places the roots are wellmoulded in summer, and carefully covered up, to prevent theheat of the sun from parching them. In other places, again,the ground is cleared away from the roots, in order to give freeaccess to the air, while in winter they are carefully mouldedto protect them from the frost. The contrary is the case, however, in hot climates, for there they bare the roots in winter<pb n="3492" />for the purpose of ensuring a supply of moisture to theparched fibres.</p><p>In all places the rule is to make a circular trench threefeet in width at the foot of the tree; this, however, it is notpossible to do in meadows, where the roots, in their fondnessfor the sun and showers, range near the surface far and wide.Such, then, are the general observations that we have to makein reference to the planting and grafting of trees that we valuefor their fruits.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">At the precepts given in this Chapter have been already given in cc.3 and 4 of the present Book.</p></body>
