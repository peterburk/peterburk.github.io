(61.)â€”THE ONLY WINGED ANIMAL THAT IS VIVIPAROUS,AND NURTURES ITS YOUNG WITH ITS MILK.</head><p>Among the winged animals, the only one that is viviparousis the bat; it is the only one, too, that has wings formed of amembrane. This is, also, the only winged creature that feedsits young with milk from the breast. The mother clasps hertwo young ones as she flies, and so carries them along withher. This animal, too, is said to have but one joint in thehaunch, and to be particularly fond of gnats.</p></div2></body>
