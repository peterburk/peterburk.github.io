All ashes of this description, we mayhere remark once for all, are prepared in the same method;the substance being placed in a new earthen vessel well coveredwith potter's clay, and put into a furnace. These ashes, too,are very good, taken in drink, and hence some recommend thehead itself to be eaten in such cases. Others, again, attach to thebody of the patient a maggot, taken from the carcase of a deaddog; or else place the menstruous blood of a bitch, in a linencloth, beneath his cup, or insert in the wound ashes of hairsfrom the tail of the dog that inflicted the bite. Dogs will flyfrom any one who has a dog's heart about him, and they willnever bark at a person who carries a dog's tongue in his shoe,beneath the great toe, or the tail of a weasel which has beenset at liberty after being deprived of it. There is beneath thetongue of a mad dog a certain slimy spittle, which, taken indrink, is a preventive of hydrophobia: but much the mostuseful plan is, to take the liver of the dog that has inflictedthe injury, and eat it raw, if possible; should that not be thecase, it must be cooked in some way or other, or else a brothmust be taken, prepared from the flesh.<pb n="5406" /></p><p>There is a small worm<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> in a dog's tongue, known as "lytta"<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>to the Greeks: if this is removed from the animal while apup, it will never become mad or lose its appetite. This worm,after being carried thrice round a fire, is given to persons whohave been bitten by a mad dog, to prevent them from becoming mad. This madness, too, is prevented by eating a cock'sbrains; but the virtue of these brains lasts for one year only,and no more. They say, too, that a cock's comb, pounded, ishighly efficacious as an application to the wound; as also,goose-grease, mixed with honey. The flesh also of a maddog is sometimes salted, and taken with the food, as a remedyfor this disease. In addition to this, young puppies of thesame sex as the dog that has inflicted the injury, are drownedin water, and the person who has been bitten eats their liverraw. The dung of poultry, provided it is of a red colour, isvery useful, applied with vinegar; the ashes, too, of the tailof a shrew-mouse, if the animal has survived and been set atliberty; a clod from a swallow's nest, applied with vinegar;the young of a swallow, reduced to ashes; or the skin or oldslough of a serpent that has been cast in spring, beaten upwith a male crab in wine: this slough, I would remark, putaway by itself in chests and drawers, destroys moths.</p><p>So virulent is the poison of the mad dog, that its very urineeven, if trod upon, is injurious, more particularly if the personhas any ulcerous sores about him. The proper remedy in suchcase is to apply horse-dung, sprinkled with vinegar, and warmedin a fig. These marvellous properties of the poison will occasion the less surprise, when we remember that, "a stone bittenby a dog" has become a proverbial expression for discord andvariance.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> Whoever makes water where a dog has previously watered, will be sensible of numbness in the loins, theysay.<pb n="5407" /></p><p>The lizard known by some persons as the "seps,"<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and byothers as the "chalcidice," taken in wine, is a cure for itsown bite.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is still the vulgar notion; but in reality there is no worm, butcertain white pustules beneath the tongue, which break spontaneously atthe end of twelve days after birth. Puppies are still "wormed," as it iscalled, as a preventive of hydrophobia, it is said, and of a propensity tognaw objects which come in their way. The "worming "consists in thebreaking of these pustules.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Rage" or "madness."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"For the manner of a dog is to bee angrie with the stone that isthrown at him, without regard to the partie that flung it, whereupon grewthe proverb in Greeke, <foreign lang="greek">ku/wn e)is to\n li/qon a\ganakto=usa</foreign> ('A dog ventinghis rage upon a stone.')"—<hi rend="ital">Holland.</hi></p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xx. cc. 6, 20.
