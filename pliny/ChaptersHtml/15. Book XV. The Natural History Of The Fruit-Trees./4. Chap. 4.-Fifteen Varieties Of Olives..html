<div2 type="chapter" n="4" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 4.ÑFIFTEEN VARIETIES OF OLIVES.</head><p>The first olive that is gathered after the autumn is that<pb n="3282" />known as the "posia,"<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> the berry of which, owing to a viciousmethod of cultivation, and not any fault on the part of Nature, has the most flesh upon it. Next to this is the orchites,which contains the greatest quantity of oil, and then, afterthat, the radius. As these are of a peculiarly delicate nature,the heat very rapidly takes effect upon them, and the amurcathey contain causes them to fall. On the other hand, thegathering of the tough, hard-skinned olive is put off so late asthe month of March, it being well able to resist the effects ofmoisture, and, consequently, very small. Those varieties knownas the Licinian, the Cominian, the Contian, and the Sergian,by the Sabines called the "royal"<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> olive, do not turn blackbefore the west winds prevail, or, in other words, before thesixth day before<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> the ides of February. At this period it isgenerally thought that they begin to ripen, and as a most excellent oil is extracted from them, experience would seem togive its support to a theory which, in reality, is altogetherwrong. The growers say that in the same degree that colddiminishes the oil, the ripeness of the berry augments it;whereas, in reality, the goodness of the oil is owing, not tothe period at which the olives are gathered, but to the naturalproperties of this peculiarvariety, in which the oil is remarkably slow in turning to amurca.</p><p>A similar error, too, is committed by those who keep theolives, when gathered, upon a layer of boards, and do notpress the fruit till it has thrown out a sweat; it being thefact that every hour lost tends to diminish the oil and increasethe amurca: the consequence is, that, according to the ordinary computation, a modius of olives yields no more than sixpounds of oil. No one, however, ever takes account of thequantity of amurca to ascertain, in reference to the samekind of berry, to what extent it increases daily in amount.Then, again, it is a very general error<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> among practical persons to suppose that the oil increases proportionably to theincreased size of the berry; and more particularly so when itis so clearly proved that such is not the case, with reference to<pb n="3283" />the variety known as the royal olive, by some called majorina,and by others phaulia;<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> this berry being of the very largestsize, and yet yielding a minimum of juice. In Egypt,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> too,the berries, which are remarkably meaty, are found to producebut very little oil; while those of Decapolis, in Syria, are soextremely small, that they are no bigger than a caper; andyet they are highly esteemed for their flesh.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> It is for thisreason that the olives from the parts beyond sea are preferredfor table to those of Italy, though, at the same time, they arevery inferior to them for making oil.</p><p>In Italy, those of Picenum and of Sidicina<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> are consideredthe best for table. These are kept apart from the others andsteeped in salt, after which, like other olives, they are put inamurca, or else boiled wine; indeed, some of them are left tofloat solely in their own oil,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> without any adventitious modeof preparation, and are then known as colymbades: sometimesthe berry is crushed, and then seasoned with green herbs toflavour it. Even in an unripe state the olive is rendered fitfor eating by being sprinkled with boiling water; it is quitesurprising, too, how readily it will imbibe sweet juices, andretain an adventitious flavour from foreign substances. Withthis fruit, as with the grape, there are purple<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> varieties, andthe posia is of a complexion approaching to black. Besidesthose already mentioned, there are the superba<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> and a remarkably luscious kind, which dries of itself, and is even sweeterthan the raisin: this last variety is extremely rare, and is to<pb n="3284" />be found in Africa and in the vicinity of Emerita<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> in Lusi-tania.The oil of the olive is prevented from getting<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> thick andrancid by the admixture of salt. By making an incision inthe bark of the tree, an aromatic odour may be imparted<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> tothe oil. Any other mode of seasoning, such, for instance, asthose used with reference to wine, is not at all gratifying tothe palate; nor do we find so many varieties in oil as thereare in the produce of the grape, there being, in general, butthree different degrees of goodness. In fine oil the odour ismore penetrating, but even in the very best it is but short-lived.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">More commonly spelt "pausia."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Regia."
