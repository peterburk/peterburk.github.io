<div2 type="chapter" n="37" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 37. (25.)ÑTHE CROCODILE.</head><p>The Nile produces the crocodile also,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> a destructive quadruped, and equally dangerous on land and in the water. Thisis the only land animal that does not enjoy the use of itstongue,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and the only one that has the upper jaw moveable,and is capable of biting with it; and terrible is its bite, for therows of its teeth fit into each other, like those of a comb.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> Itslength mostly exceeds eighteen cubits. It produces eggs aboutthe size of those of the goose, and, by a kind of instinctiveforesight, always deposits them beyond the limit to whichthe river Nile rises, when at its greatest height.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> There isno animal that arrives at so great a bulk as this, from so smalla beginning.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> It is armed also with claws, and has a skin,<pb n="2288" />that is proof against all blows. It passes the day on land, andthe night in the water, in both instances on account of thewarmth.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> When it has glutted itself with fish, it goes tosleep on the banks of the river, a portion of the food alwaysremaining in its mouth; upon which, a little bird, which inEgypt is known as the trochilus, and, in Italy, as the king ofthe birds, for the purpose of obtaining food, invites the crocodile to open its jaws; then, hopping to and fro, it firstcleans the outside of its mouth, next the teeth, and then theinside, while the animal opens its jaws as wide as possible,in consequence of the pleasure which it experiences from thetitillation.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> It is at these moments that the ichneumon, seeingit fast asleep in consequence of the agreeable sensation thusproduced, darts down its throat like an arrow, and eats awayits intestines.<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Many of the ancients have described the crocodile; of these, the mostimportant, for the correctness of the description, are Herodotus, B. ii. c.68; Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. ii. c. 10, <hi rend="ital">et alibi;</hi> and Diodorus Siculus,B. i.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The tongue of the crocodile is flat, and, as afterwards stated, B. xi.c. 65, adheres to the lower jaw, so as to be incapable of motion.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This account was first given by Herodotus, <hi rend="ital">ubi supra;</hi> and, from theform of the head and the neighbouring parts, depicts what would naturallyoccur to the observer; but it is not correct. The actual state of the parts,and their connection with each other, as Cuvier informs us, were firstsatisfactorily explained by Geoffroi Saint Hilaire.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">®lian, Anim. Nat. B. v. c. 52, observes, that this is the case withthe tortoise, and similar animals.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier says, that when it leaves the egg, the young animal is onlysix inches long, and that it ultimately attains a size of from thirty toforty feet.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Herodotus says, that it remains all night in the water, as beingwarmer than the external air. So also Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. ii. c.10.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The water of the Nile abounds with small leeches, which attach tothe throat of the crocodile, and, as it has no means of removing them, itallows a little bird to enter its mouth for this purpose; this is describedby Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. ix. c. 6, and by Julian, Anim. Nat. B. iii. c,2.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Although this account is sanctioned by all the ancient naturalists, itis called in question by Cuvier; Ajasson, vol. vi. p. 441; Lemaire, vol. iii.p. 421.ÑB.</p></body>
