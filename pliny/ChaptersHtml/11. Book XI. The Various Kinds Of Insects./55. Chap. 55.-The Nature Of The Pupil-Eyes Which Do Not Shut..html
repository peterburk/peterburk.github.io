<div2 type="chapter" n="55" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 55.ÑTHE NATURE OF THE PUPIL-EYES WHICH DO NOTSHUT.</head><p>In the midst of the cornea of the eye Nature has formed awindow in the pupil, the small dimensions of which do notpermit the sight to wander at hazard and with uncertainty,hut direct it as straight as though it were through a tube,and at the same time ensure its avoidance of all shocks communicated by foreign bodies. The pupils are surrounded by ablack circle in some persons, while it is of a yellowish cast withothers, and azure again with others. By this happy combination the light is received by the eye upon the white that liesaround the pupil, and its reflection being thus tempered, itfails to impede or confuse the sight by its harshness. Socomplete a mirror, too, does the eye form, that the pupil,<pb n="3053" />small as it is, is able to reflect the entire image of a man.This<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> is the reason why most birds, when held in the handof a person, will more particularly peck at his eyes; for seeingtheir own likeness reflected in the pupils, they are attracted toit by what seem to be the objects of their natural affection.</p><p>It is only some few beasts of burden that are subject tomaladies of the eyes towards the increase of the moon: but itis man alone that is rescued from blindness by the dischargeof the humours<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> that have caused it. Many persons havehad their sight restored after being blind for twenty years;while others, again, have been denied this blessing from theirvery birth, without there being any blemish in the eyes. Manypersons, again, have suddenly lost their sight from no apparentcause, and without any preceding injury. The most learnedauthors say that there are veins which communicate from theeye to the brain, but I am inclined to think that the communication is with the stomach; for it is quite certain that a personnever loses the eye without feeling sickness at the stomach. Itis an important and sacred duty, of high sanction among theRomans, to close<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> the eyes of the dead, and then again to openthem when the body is laid on the funeral pile, the usagehaving taken its rise in the notion of its being improper thatthe eyes of the dead should be beheld by man, while it is anequally great offence to hide them from the view of heaven.Man is the only living creature the eyes of which are subjectto deformities, from which, in fact, arose the family names of" Strabo" <span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and "P¾tus." <span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> The ancients used to call a manwho was born with only one eye, "cocles," and "ocella," aperson whose eyes were remarkably small. " Luscinus" wasthe surname given to one who happened to have lost one eveby an accident.</p><p>The eyes of animals that see at night in the dark, cats, forinstance, are shining and radiant, so much so, that it is impossible to look upon them; those of the she-goat, too, and thewolf are resplendent, and emit a light like fire. The eyes ofthe sea-calf and the hyena change successively to a thousand<pb n="3054" />colours; and the eyes, when dried, of most of the fishes willgive out light in the dark, just in the same way as the trunkof the oak when it has become rotten with extreme old age.We have already mentioned<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> the fact, that animals which turn,not the eyes but the head, for the purpose of looking round,are never known to wink. It is said,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> too, that the chameleon is able to roll the eye-balls completely round. Crabs looksideways, and have the eves enclosed beneath a thin crust.Those of craw-fish and shrimps are very hard and prominent,and lie in a great measure beneath a defence of a similarnature. Those animals, however, the eyes of which are hard,have worse sight than those of which the eyes are formed of ahumid substance. It is said that if the eyes are taken awayfrom the young of serpents and of the swallow,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> they will growagain. In all insects and in animals covered with a shell, theeyes move just in the same way as the ears of quadrupeds do;those among them which have a brittle<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> covering have theeyes hard. All animals of this nature, as well as fishes andinsects, are destitute of eye-lids, and their eyes have no covering; but in all there is a membrane that is transparent likeglass, spread over them.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hardouin with justice doubts the soundness of this alleged reason.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He alludes, probably, to some method of curing cataract; perhapssomewhat similar to that mentioned by him in B. xx. c. 20.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This was done by the nearest relatives.
