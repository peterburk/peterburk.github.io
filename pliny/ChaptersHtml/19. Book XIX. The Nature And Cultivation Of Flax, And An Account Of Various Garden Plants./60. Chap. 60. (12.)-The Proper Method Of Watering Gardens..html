<div2 type="chapter" n="60" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 60. (12.)—THE PROPER METHOD OF WATERING GARDENS.</head><p>The proper times<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> for watering are the morning and theevening, to prevent the water from being heated<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> by the sunwith the sole exception, however, of ocimum, which requiresto be watered at midday; indeed, this plant, it is generallythought, will grow with additional rapidity, if it is wateredwith boiling water when sown. All plants, when trans-<pb n="4202" />planted, grow all the better and larger for it, leeks and turnipsmore particularly. Transplanting, too, is attended with certainremedial effects, and acts as a preservative to certain plants,such as scallions, for instance, leeks, radishes, parsley, lettuces,rape, and cucumbers. All the wild plants<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> are generallysmaller in the leaf and stalk than the cultivated ones, and havemore acrid juices, cunila, wild marjoram, and rue, for example.Indeed, it is only the lapathum<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> that is better in a wild statethan cultivated: in its cultivated state it is the same plantthat is known to us as the "rumix," being the most vigorous<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>by far of all the plants that are grown; so much so, indeed,that it is said that when it has once taken root, it will last forever, and can never be extirpated from the soil, more particu-larly if water happens to be near at hand. Its juices, whichare employed only in ptisans,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> as an article of food, have theeffect of imparting to them a softer and more exquisite flavour.The wild variety<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> is employed for many medicinal purposes.</p><p>So true it is, that the careful research of man has omittednothing, that I have even met with a poem,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> in which I findit stated, that if pellets of goats' dung, the size of a bean, arehollowed out, and the seed of leeks, rocket, lettuces, parsley,endive, and cresses is inserted in them, and then sown, theplants will thrive in a marvellous degree. Plants<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> in a wildstate, it is generally thought, are more dry and acrid than whencultivated.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From Theophrastus, B. vii. c. 5.
