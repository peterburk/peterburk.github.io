GORGONIA.GONIAÆA.</head><p>Galaxias,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> by some called "galactitis,"<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> is a stone that closelyresembles those next mentioned, but is interspersed withveins of blood-red or white. Galactitis<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> is of the uniformcolour of milk; other names given to it are, leucogæa,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> leucographitis,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>and synnephitis,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> and, when pounded in water,both in taste and colour it marvellously resembles milk. Thisstone promotes the secretion of the milk in nursing women, itis said; in addition to which, attached to the neck of infants, itproduces saliva, and it dissolves when put into the mouth.They say, too, that it deprives persons of their memory: it isin the rivers Nilus and Acheloüs that it is produced. Somepersons give the name of "galactitis" to a smaragdus surroundedwith veins of white. Gallaica is a stone like argyrodamas,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>but of a somewhat more soiled appearance; these stones arefound in twos and threes clustered together. The people ofMedia send us gassinade,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> a stone like orobus in colour, andsprinkled with flowers, as it were: it is found at Arbela.This stone, too, conceives,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> it is said; a fact which it admitswhen shaken; the conception lasting for a period of threemonths. Glossopetra,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> which resembles the human tongue, isnot engendered, it is said, in the earth, but falls from theheavens during the moon's eclipse; it is considered highly necessaryfor the purposes of selenomancy.<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> To render all this<pb n="6450" />however, still more incredible, we have the evident untruthfulnessof one assertion made about it, that it has the property ofsilencing the winds. Gorgonia<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> is nothing but a coral, whichhas been thus named from the circumstance that, though softin the sea, it afterwards assumes the hardness of stone: it hasthe property of counteracting fascinations,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> it is said. Goniæa,<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>it is asserted, and with the same degree of untruthfulness,ensures vengeance upon our enemies.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Galaxy stone."
