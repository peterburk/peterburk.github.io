The flocks, forming a point,move along with great impetus, much, indeed, after the mannerof our Liburnian beaked galleys; and it is by doing so thatthey are enabled to cleave the air more easily than if theypresented to it a broad front. The flight gradually enlarges<pb n="2503" />in the rear, much in the form of a wedge, presenting a vastsurface to the breeze, as it impels them onward; those thatfollow place their necks on those that go before, while theleading birds, as they become weary, fall to the rear. Storksreturn to their former nests, and the young, in their turn, supporttheir parents when old. It is stated that at the moment ofthe swan's death, it gives utterance to a mournful song;<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> butthis is an error, in my opinion, at least I have tested the truthof the story on several occasions. These birds will eat theflesh of one another.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">M. Mauduit has a learned discussion in Panckouke's Translation, vol.viii., many pages in length; in which he satisfactorily shows that this isnot entirely fabulous, but that the wild swan of the northern climates reallyis possessed of a tuneful note or cadence. Of course, the statement that itonly sings just before its death, must be rejected as fabulous.</p></body>
