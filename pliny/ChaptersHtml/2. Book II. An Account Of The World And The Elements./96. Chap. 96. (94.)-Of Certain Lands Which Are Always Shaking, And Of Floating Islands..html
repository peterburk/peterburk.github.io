<div2 type="chapter" n="96" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 96. (94.)—OF CERTAIN LANDS WHICH ARE ALWAYSSHAKING, AND OF FLOATING ISLANDS.</head><p>There are certain lands which shake when any one passesover them<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>; as in the territory of the Gabii, not far from thecity of Rome, there are about 200 acres which shake whencavalry passes over it: the same thing takes place at Reate.</p><p>(95.) There are certain islands which are always floating<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>,as in the territory of the Cæcubum<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>, and of the above-mentionedReate, of Mutina, and of Statonia. In the lake ofVadimonis and the waters of Cutiliæ there is a dark wood,which is never seen in the same place for a day and a nighttogether. In Lydia, the islands named Calaminæ are not<pb n="1123" />only driven about by the wind, but may be even pushed atpleasure from place to place, by poles: many citizens savedthemselves by this means in the Mithridatic war. There aresome small islands in the Nymphæus, called the Dancers<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>,because, when choruses are sung, they are moved by themotions of those who beat time. In the great Italian lake ofTarquinii, there are two islands with groves on them, whichare driven about by the wind, so as at one time to exhibitthe figure of a triangle and at another of a circle; but theynever form a square<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Ad ingressum ambulantium, et equorum cursus, terræ quoquetremere sentiuntur in Brabantino agro, quæ Belgii pars, etcirca S.Audomari fanum."

There are frequentlysmall portions of land detached from the edges of lakes, by floods orrapid currents, held together and rendered buoyant by a mass of rootsand vegetable matter. In the lake of Keswick, in the county of Cumberland, there are two small floating islands, of a few yards in circumference, which are moved about by the wind or by currents; they appearto consist, principally, of a mass of vegetable fibres.</p></body>
