<div2 type="chapter" n="23" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 23.ÑTHE MODE OF GRINDING CORN.</head><p>All the grains ar¾ not easily broken. In Etruria they first<pb n="4037" />parch the spelt in the ear, and then pound it with a pestleshod with iron at the end. In this instrument the iron isnotched<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> at the bottom, sharp ridges running out like theedge of a knife, and concentrating in the form of a star; sothat if care is not taken to hold the pestle perpendicularlywhile pounding, the grains will only be splintered and the ironteeth broken. Throughout the greater part of Italy, however,they employ a pestle that is only rough<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> at the end, andwheels turned by water, by means of which the corn is gradually ground. I shall here set forth the opinions given byMago as to the best method of pounding corn. He says thatthe wheat should be steeped first of all in water, and thencleaned from the husk; after which it should be dried in thesun, and then pounded with the pestle; the same plan, hesays, should be adopted in the preparation of barley. In thelatter case, however, twenty sextarii of grain require only twosextarii of water. When lentils are used, they should be firstparched, and then lightly pounded with, the bran; or else,adopting another method, a piece of unbaked brick and half amodius of sand<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> should be added to every twenty sextarii oflentils.</p><p>Ervilia should be treated in the same way as lentils. Sesameshould be first steeped in warm water, and then laid out todry, after which it should be rubbed out briskly, and thenthrown into cold water, so that the chaff may be disengagedby floating to the surface. After this is done, the grain shouldagain be spread out in the sun, upon linen cloths, to dry. Care,however, should be taken to lose no time in doing this, as it isapt to turn musty, and assume a dull, livid colour. The grains,too, which are just cleaned from the husk, require variousmethods of pounding. When the beard is ground by itself,without the grain, the result is known as "acus,"<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> but it isonly used by goldsmiths.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> If, on the other hand, it is beaten<pb n="4038" />out on the threshing-floor, together with the straw, the chaffhas the name of "palea," * * * * and in most parts ofthe world is employed as fodder for beasts of burden. Theresidue of millet, panic, and sesame, is known to us as"apluda;" but in other countries it is called by various othernames.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This would rather <hi rend="ital">grate</hi> the grain than <hi rend="ital">pound</hi> it, as Beckmann observes.
