It is in thisway that many of the trees are reproduced, and the fig moreparticularly; which may be propagated also by all the methodspreviously stated, with the exception, indeed, of that by cuttings.<pb n="3486" />The best plan, however, is to take a pretty large branch, and,after sharpening it like a stake,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> to drive it to a considerabledepth in the earth, taking care to leave only a small portionabove ground, and then to cover it over with sand. The pomegranate, too, may be planted in a similar manner, the holebeing first widened with a stake; the same, too, with the myrtle.For all trees of this nature a branch is required three feet inlength, and not quite the thickness of the arm, care beingtaken to keep the bark on, and to sharpen the branch to apoint at the lower end.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See c. 29 of this Book.</p></body>
