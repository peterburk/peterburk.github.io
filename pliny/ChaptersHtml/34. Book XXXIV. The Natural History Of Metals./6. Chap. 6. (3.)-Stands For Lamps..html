(3.)—STANDS FOR LAMPS.</head><p>Ægina was particularly famous for the manufacture ofsockets only for lamp-stands, as Tarentum was for that of thebranches;<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> the most complete articles were, therefore, producedby the union of the two. There are persons, too, whoare not ashamed to give for one a sum equal to the salary ofa military tribune,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> although, as its name indicates, its onlyuse is to hold a lighted candle. On the sale of one of theselamp-stands, Theon the public crier announced, that the purchasermust also take, as part of the lot, one Clesippus, afuller, who was hump-backed, and in other respects, of ahideous aspect. The purchase was made by a female named<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>Gegania, for fifty thousand sesterces. Upon her exhibitingthese purchases at an entertainment which she gave, theslave, for the amusement of her guests, was brought in naked.Conceiving an infamous passion for him, she first admittedhim to her bed, and finally left him all her estate. Havingthus become excessively rich, he adored the lamp-stand asmuch as any divinity, and the story became a sort of pendantto the celebrity of the Corinthian lamp-stands. Still, however,good morals were vindicated in the end, for he erected asplendid monument to her memory, and so kept alive the eternalremembrance of the misconduct of Gegania. But althoughit is well known that there are no lamp-stands in existencemade of the Corinthian metal, yet this name is very generallyattached to them, because, in consequence of the victory of<pb n="6153" />Mummius,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> Corinth was destroyed: at the same time, however,it should be remembered that this victory dispersed a numberof bronzes which originally came from many other cities ofAchaia.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The words in the original are, respectively <hi rend="ital">candelabra, superficics,</hi>and <hi rend="ital">scapi.</hi>—B.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably a proverbial expression at Rome, as it is employed by Juvenal,in an analogous manner, upon another occasion; Sat. iii. 1. 132.—B.33 Plutarch speaks of the Geganii as an ancient noble family at Rome.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pultarch speaks of the Geganii as an ancient noble family at Rome.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxxiii. c. 53.</p></body>
