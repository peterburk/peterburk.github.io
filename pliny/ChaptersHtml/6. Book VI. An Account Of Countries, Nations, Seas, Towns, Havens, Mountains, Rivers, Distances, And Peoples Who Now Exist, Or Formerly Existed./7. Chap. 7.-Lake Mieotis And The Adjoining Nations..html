We then come to the river Tanais,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> which discharges<pb n="2015" />itself into the sea by two mouths, and the banks of which areinhabited by the Sarmatæ, the descendants of the Medi, it issaid, a people divided into numerous tribes. The first of theseare the Sauromatæ Gynæcocratumeni,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> the husbands of theAmazons. Next to them are the Ævazæ,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> the Coitæ,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> the Cicimeni, the Messeniani, the Costobocci, the Choatræ, the Zigæ,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> the Dandarii, the Thyssagetæ, and theIyrcæ,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> as far ascertain rugged deserts and densely wooded vallies, beyond whichagain are the Arimphæi,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> who extend as far as the RiphæanMountains.<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> The Scythians call the river Tanais by the nameof Silis, and the Mæotis the Temarunda, meaning the "motherof the sea." There is<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> a city also at the mouth of the Ta-<pb n="2016" />nais. The neighbouring country was inhabited first by theCarians, then by the Clazomenii and Mæones, and after themby the Panticapenses.<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span></p><p>There are some writers who state that there are the following nations dwelling around the Mæotis, as far as the Ceraunian mountains;<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> at a short distance from the shore, the Napitæ, and beyond them, the Essedones, who join up to the Colchians, and dwell upon the summits of the mountains: afterthese again, the Camacæ, the Orani, the Autacæ, the Mazacasi, the Cantiocæ, the Agamathæ, the Pici, the Rimosoli,the Acascomarci, and, upon the ridges of the Caucasus, theItacalæ, the Imadochi, the Rami, the Anclacæ, the Tydii, theCarastasei, and the Anthiandæ. The river Lagoüs runs from theCathæan<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> mountains, and into it flows the Opharus. Uponit are the tribes of the Cauthadæ, and the Opharitæ. Nextto these are the rivers Menotharus and Imityes, which flowfrom the Cissian mountains, among the peoples called the Acdei,the Carnæ, the Oscardei, the Accisi, the Gabri, the Gogari,and, around the source of the Imityes, the Imityi, and theApatræi. Some writers say that the Auchetæ, the Athernei,and the Asampatæ, Scythian tribes, have made inroads uponthis territory, and have destroyed the Tanaitæ and the Inapæito a man. Others again represent the Ocharius as runningthrough the Cantici and the Sapæi, and the Tanais as passingthrough the territories of the Sarcharcei, the Herticei, theSpondolici, the Synhietæ, the Anasi, the Issi, the Catetæ, theTagoræ, the Caroni, the Neripi, the Agandei, the Mandarei,the Satarchei, and the Spalei.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">That lying on the east of the Sea of Azof. It seems impossible to identify the spot inhabited by each of these savage tribes.

He remarks, that most of these names appear to have been greatly mutilated, through the ignorance or carelessness of the transcribers, no two of the manuscripts agreeing as to the mode in which they should be spelt.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or Don.

It isnot improbable that this name was given by some geographer to these Sarmatian tribes on finding them, at the period of his visit, in subjection to therule of a queen. Parisot remarks, that this passage affords an instance ofthe little care bestowed by Pliny upon procuring the best and most correctinformation, for that the Roman writers had long repudiated the use of theterm "Sauromatæ." He also takes Pliny to task for his allusion to thesetribes as coupling with the Amazons, the existence of such a people beingin his time generally disbelieved.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hardouin suggests from <foreign lang="greek">eu(a/zw,</foreign> "to celebrate the orgies of Bacchus."</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Perhaps from <foreign lang="greek">koi/tn,</foreign> a "den" or "cavern," their habitation.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Parisot suggests that they may have been a Caucasian or Circassiantribe, because in the Circassian language the word <hi rend="ital">zig</hi> has the meaning of "man." He also suggests that they were probably a distinct race from the Zingi previously mentioned, whom he identifies with the ancestors of the Zingari or Bohemians, the modern Gypsies.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The more common reading is "Tureæ" a tribe also mentioned by Mela, and which gave name to modern Turkistan.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Argippæi of Herodotus and other ancient authors. These people were bald, flat-nosed, and long-chinned. They are again mentioned by Pliny in C. 14, who calls them a race not unlike the Hyperborei, and then, like Mela, abridges the description given by Herodotus. By different writers these people have been identified with the Chinese, the Brahmins or Lamas, and the Calmucks. The last is thought to be the most probable opinion, or else that the description of Herodotus, borrowed by other writers, may be applied to the Mongols in general. The mountains, at the foot of which they have been placed, are identified with either the Ural, the western extremity of the Altai chain, or the eastern part of the Altai.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Generally regarded as the western branch of the Ural Mountains.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The former editions mostly have "there <hi rend="ital">was,"</hi> implying that in the time of Pliny it no longer existed. The name of this place was Tanais; its ruins are still to be seen in the vicinity of Kassatchei. It was founded by a colony from Miletus, and became a flourishing seat of trade.
