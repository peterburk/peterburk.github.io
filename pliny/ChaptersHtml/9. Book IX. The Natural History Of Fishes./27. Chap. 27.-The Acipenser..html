<div2 type="chapter" n="27" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 27.ÑTHE ACIPENSER.</head><p>Among the ancients, the acipenser<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> was esteemed the most<pb n="2399" />noble fish of all; it is the only one that has the scales turnedtowards the head, and in a contrary direction to that in whichit swims. At the present day, however, it is held in no esteem,which I am the more surprised at, it being so very rarely found.Some writers call this fish the elops.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier says, that the peculiarity in the scales here mentioned is notfound in any fish; but that the sturgeon genus has, in place of scales,lamin¾ disposed in longitudinal lines in such a way, that the one doesnot lap over the other, as is the case with fish in general. It wasthis fact, misstated probably, that gave rise to the story; and it is mostlikely this that has led Rondelet, and most of the modern naturalists, tolook upon the acipenser as the common sturgeon, and to give that nameto the sturgeon genus. Athen¾us reckons it among the cartilaginousfishes, and in the family of the squali; but Pliny here speaks of it as veryrare, and Martial and Cicero say the same, which cannot be so accuratelysaid of the sturgeon. Archestratus, in Athen¾us, speaks of it as small,having a sharp-pointed muzzle, and of triangular shape, and tells us thata very inferior one was valued at 1000 Attic drachm¾. The sturgeon, onthe other hand, is often ten or twelve feet in length. The acipenser wasnot always in vogue with the Romans, but when it was, it was most highlyesteemed; and according to Athen¾us, B. vii., and Sammonicus Severus,as quoted by Macrobius, B. ii. c. 12, it was brought to table by servantscrowned with flowers and preceded by a piper. All these circumstanceslead Cuvier to be of opinion that under this name is meant a kind of smallsturgeon with a sharp muzzle, greatly esteemed by the Russians, and bythem known as the sterlet, the Acipenser Ruthenus of Linn¾us, the Acipenser Pygm¾us of Pallas. It is found in the Black Sea, and in therivers that fall into it; and has been carried with success to Lake Ladoga,as also Lake Meler, in Sweden. This is the smallest and most delicate ofthe sturgeon genus, and Professor Pallas says that they are sold at St.Petersburgh at "insane prices," when more than two feet in length. itis not improbable that it was found in the rivers of Asia Minor, and thencecarried to Rome occasionally. Pliny, indeed, B. xxxiii. c. 11, says that itis not a stranger to Italy; if so, it would seem to be different from the"elops," of which Ovid says, Halieut. 1. 96, "and the precious elops,unknown in our waters," though he also says of the "acipenser," in 1.132, "and thou, acipenser, famed in distant waters." Still, however,Cuvier says, the use of names was not so accurate among the ancients, butwhat that of "acipenser" may have been given to the sturgeon in general;and this may have given rise to the present assertions of Pliny. Oppian,in Athen¾us, B. vii., says, like Pliny, that the elops was the same as theacipenser, and we find no characteristics given of the elops to make us conclude that the two were not synonymous. Indeed, we find that Varro,De Re Rustica, B. ii. c. 6, and Pliny in c. 54 of the present Book, speakof the elops as being most excellent at Rhodes, while we find Archestratusin Athen¾us, B. vii., speaking of the same as being the locality of theacipenser; and Columella, B. viii. c. 16, and ®lian, B. viii. c. 28, placeit in the Pamphylian Sea, which is not far distant from Rhodes. Pliny,B. xxxii. c. 11, states, that the palm of fine flavour was by many accordedto the elops; while Matron Parodus, in Athen¾us, calls it the "most nobleof all fishes, food worthy of the gods." From the immense sums thatwere given for it, as we learn from Varro, quoted by Nonius Marcellus, itwas called the "multum munus," or "multinummus," the "much-moneyfish." ®lian says, B. viii. c. 28, that the fishermen who were fortunateenough to take an elops, were in the habit of crowning themselves andtheir vessel with garlands, and announcing it, on entering harbour, by thesound of the trumpet. Professor Pallas, in his work on the Russian Zoography, takes the elops to be a kind of sturgeon, more spiny than the rest,which is represented by Marsigli under the name of "Huso sextus." Hedoes not, however, give his reason for fixing on this as the elops of theancients. It has been also suggested that the elops was the same as thesword-fish.</p></body>
