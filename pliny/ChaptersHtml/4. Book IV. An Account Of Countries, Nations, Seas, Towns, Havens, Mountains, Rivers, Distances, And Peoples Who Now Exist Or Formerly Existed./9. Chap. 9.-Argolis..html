The rivers are theInachus<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> and the Erasinus, between which lies Argos, surnamedHippium<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>, situate beyond the place called Lerna<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>, andat a distance of two miles from the sea. Nine miles farther isMycenæ<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>, and the place where, it is said, Tiryns<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> stood; thesite, too, of Mantinea<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>. The mountains are, Artemius,Apesantus<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>, Asterion<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>, Parparus, and some others,eleven innumber. The fountains are those of Niobe<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>, Amymone, andPsamathe.</p><p>From Scyllæum to the Isthmus of Corinth is a distanceof 177 miles. We find here the towns of Hermione<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>,Trœzen<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span>, Coryphasium<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span>, and Argos, sometimes called "Ina-<pb n="1285" />chian," sometimes "Dipsian"<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> Argos. Then comes the portof Schœnites<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span>, and the Saronic Gulf, which was formerlyencircled with a grove of oaks<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span>, from which it derives itspresent name, oaks in ancient Greece having been so called.Upon this gulf is the town of Epidaurus, famous for itstemple of Æsculapius<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span>, the Promontory of Spiræum<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span>, the portof Anthedus<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span>, Bucephalus<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span>, and then Cenchreæ, previouslymentioned, on this side of the Isthmus, with its temple ofNeptune<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span>, famous for the games celebrated there every fiveyears. So many are the gulfs which penetrate the shores ofthe Peloponnesus, so many the seas which howl around it.Invaded by the Ionian on the north, it is beaten by theSicilian on the west, buffeted by the Cretan on the south,by the Ægean on the S.E., and by the Myrtoan on the N.E.;which last sea begins at the Gulf of Megara, and washes allthe coast of Attica.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Capo Skillo.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or Bœæ.

Its ruins are numerous,and of great magnificence.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Its ruins are of the most interesting nature, presenting enormousmasses of stone, of Cyclopian architecture. The spot is at the present daycalled Palæ-Nauplia.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It must not be confounded with the place in Arcadia, whereEpaminondas fell.

Therewas a promontory of that name in Messenia; but it cannot be the placehere spoken of.</p><p><span id="note_18"><a href="#ref_18">18. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is supposed that Pliny here alludes to Argos Hippium, which hehas previously mentioned; but only in connection with the rivers Inachusand Erasinus, and not as included in the list of the towns of Argolis.The origin of the term "Dipsian" is probably unknown. It could hardlyallude to drought, as Argos was abundantly supplied with water. Butsee B. vii. c. 57.</p><p><span id="note_19"><a href="#ref_19">19. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ansart says that this is the modern Porto Estremo, at the mouth ofthe Saronic Gulf.</p><p><span id="note_20"><a href="#ref_20">20. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hesychius says that oaks were called <foreign lang="greek">sarwnide\s</foreign> inthe language ofancient Greece.

The ruins of this templeare still to be seen, and those of the theatre at Epidaurus are veryextensive. The village of Pidharvo stands in the midst of the ruins.</p><p><span id="note_22"><a href="#ref_22">22. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The modern Capo Franco.</p><p><span id="note_23"><a href="#ref_23">23. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Lapie takes Anthedus, or Anthedon, to be the place now calledPorto d'Athene.</p><p><span id="note_24"><a href="#ref_24">24. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This appears to have been a port of Corinth, on a promontory of thesame name, meaning, probably from its shape, the "Bull's Head Point."</p><p><span id="note_25"><a href="#ref_25">25. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Called the 'Posideium'; in its vicinity the games were celebrated.The Isthmian Sanctuary was especially famous as a place of refuge.</p></body>
