A slip also torn away from the root will producea sucker with vitality, and the same may be obtained from themore tender among the branches. In Assyria, the tree itself<pb n="3173" />is sometimes laid level, and then covered over in a moist soil;upon which it will throw out roots all over, but it will growonly to be a number of shrubs, and never a tree: hence it isthat they plant nurseries, and transplant the young trees whena year old, and again when two years old, as they thrive allthe better for being transplanted; this is done in the springseason in other countries, but in Assyria about the rising of theDog-star. In those parts they do not touch the young treeswith the knife, but merely tie up the foliage that they mayshoot upwards, and so attain considerable height. Whenthey are strong they prune them, in order to increase theirthickness, but in so doing leave the branches for about half afoot; indeed, if they were cut off at any other place, the operation would kill the parent tree. We have already<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> mentioned that they thrive particularly well in a saltish soil;hence, when the soil is not of that nature, it is the custom toscatter salt, not exactly about the roots, but at a little distanceoff. There are palm-trees in Syria and in Egypt which divideinto two trunks, and some in Crete into three and as many asfive even.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> Some of these trees bear immediately at the end ofthree years, and in Cyprus, Syria, and Egypt, when they arefour years old; others again at the end of five years: at whichperiod the tree is about the height of a man. So long as thetree is quite young the fruit has no seed within, from whichcircumstance it has received the nickname of the "eunuch."<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The same methods of propagating the palm are still followed in theEast, and in the countries near the tropics.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In c. 7 of the present Book.
