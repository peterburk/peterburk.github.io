The most ancient instance of this practice, so far as Iknow of, is found in the palace of Mausolus, at Halicarnassus,the walls of which, in brick, are covered with marble of Proconnesus.Mausolus died in the second year of the hundredand seventh<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> Olympiad, being the year of Rome, 403.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This date does not agree with that given to Scopas, one of the artistswho worked at the Mausoleum, in the early part of B. xxxiv. c. 19. Sillig,however, is inclined to think that there were <hi rend="ital">two</hi> artists named Scopas,and would thus account for the diversity of about seventy years betweenthe dates.</p></body>
