<div2 type="chapter" n="47" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 47. (16.)ÑTHE ORES OF LEAD.</head><p>The nature of lead next comes to be considered. Thereare two kinds of it, the black and the white.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> The white isthe most valuable: it was called by the Greeks "cassiteros,"<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>and there is a fabulous story told of their going in quest ofit to the islands of the Atlantic, and of its being brought inbarks made of osiers, covered with hides.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> It is now knownthat it is a production of Lusitania and Gall¾cia.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> It is asand found on the surface of the earth, and of a black colour,and is only to be detected by its weight. It is mingled withsmall pebbles, particularly in the dried beds of rivers. Theminers wash this sand, and calcine the deposit in the furnace.It is also found in the gold mines that are known as "aluti¾,"<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span><pb n="6213" />the stream of water which is passed through them detachingcertain black pebbles, mottled with small white spots and ofthe same weight<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> as gold. Hence it is that they remain withthe gold in the baskets in which it is collected; and beingseparated in the furnace, are then melted, and become convertedinto white lead.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span></p><p>Black lead is not procured in Gall¾cia, although it is sogreatly abundant in the neighbouring province of Cantabria;nor is silver procured from white lead, although it is fromblack.<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> Pieces of black lead cannot be soldered without theintervention of white lead, nor can this be done without employingoil;<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> nor can white lead, on the other hand, be unitedwithout the aid of black lead. White lead was held in estimationin the days even of the Trojan War, a fact that is attestedby Homer, who calls it "cassiteros."<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> There are twodifferent sources of black lead: it being procured either fromits own native ore, where it is produced without the intermixtureof any other substance, or else from an ore which containsit in common with silver, the two metals being fused together.The metal which first becomes liquid in the furnace,is called "stannum;"<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> the next that melts is silver; and themetal that remains behind is galena,<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> the third constituentpart of the mineral. On this last being again submitted tofusion black lead is produced, with a deduction of two-ninths.<pb n="6214" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is most probable that the "black lead" of Pliny was our lead, andthe "white lead" our tin.

Small boats, corresponding to thedescription here given, were very lately still in use among the inhabitantsof some parts of the south-west coast of England [and on the Severn].Pliny has already spoken of these boats in B. vii. c. 57.ÑB.
