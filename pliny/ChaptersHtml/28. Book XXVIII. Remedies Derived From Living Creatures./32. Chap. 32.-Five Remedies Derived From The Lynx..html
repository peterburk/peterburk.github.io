It is saidthat in the Isle of Carpathus a most powerful medicament isobtained by reducing to ashes the nails of the lynx, togetherwith the hide; that these ashes, taken in drink, have theeffect of checking abominable desires in men; and that, if theyare sprinkled upon women, all libidinous thoughts will berestrained. They are good too for the removal of itchingsensations in any part of the body. The urine of the lynx isa remedy for strangury; for which reason the animal, it issaid, is in the habit of rooting up the ground and covering itthe moment it is voided.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> It is mentioned, too, that this urineis an effectual remedy for pains in the throat. Thus muchwith reference to foreign animals.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. viii. c. 57.</p></body>
