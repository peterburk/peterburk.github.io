They say, too, that it should be kept about theperson as an antidote to poison, and that to keep serpents away itshould be strewed beneath the bed, burnt, or else carried on theperson; decoctions of it in wine, either fresh-gathered or dried,should be used too as a liniment for the body. Medical menprescribe it in vinegar for affections of the spleen, and in winefor the jaundice; a decoction of it in wine is recommendedalso for incipient dropsy; and in this way too, it is employed as aliniment for wounds. This plant has the effect of bringingaway the after-birth and the dead fœtus, and of dispellingpains in various parts of the body: it empties the bladder also,and is employed in liniments for defluxions of the eyes. In-<pb n="4373" />deed, there is no plant known that better deserves to form aningredient in the medicament known to us as the "alexipharmacon:"<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> though there are some who say that it is injurious tothe stomach and is apt to stuff the head, and that it producesabortion—assertions which<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> others, again, totally deny.</p><p>There is a superstitious observance also, to the effect that,for cataract, it ought to be attached to the neck the momentit is found, every precaution being taken not to let it touch theground. The same persons state too that the leaves of it aresimilar to those of thyme, except that they are softer and morewhite and downy. Beaten up with wild rue in rain water, itis said to assuage the pain of the sting of the asp; it is quiteas astringent too as the flower<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> of the pomegranate, and asefficacious for closing wounds and preventing them fromspreading.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See c. 21 of this Book.
