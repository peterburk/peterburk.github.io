<div2 type="chapter" n="56" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 56.—THE PROPER TIMES FOR SOWING.</head><p>We now come to a subject which has been hitherto deferredby us, and which requires our most careful attention—theproper times for sowing. This is a question that depends ina very great degree upon the stars; and I shall therefore makeit my first care to set forth all the opinions that have beenwritten in reference to the subject. Hesiod, the first writerwho has given any precepts upon agriculture, speaks of oneperiod only for sowing—the setting of the Vergiliæ: but thenhe wrote in Bœotia, a country of Hellas, where, as we havealready stated,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> they are still in the habit of sowing at thatperiod.</p><p>It is generally agreed by the most correct writers, that withthe earth, as with the birds and quadrupeds, there are certainimpulses for reproduction; and the epoch for this is fixed bythe Greeks at the time when the earth is warm and moist.Virgil<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> says that wheat and spelt should be sown at the settingof the Vergiliæ, barley between the autumnal equinox andthe winter solstice, and vetches,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> kidney-beans, and lentils atthe setting of Boötes:<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> it is of great importance, therefore,to ascertain the exact days of the rising and setting of theseconstellations, as well as of the others. There are some, again,who recommend the sowing to be done before the setting ofthe Vergiliæ, but only in a dry soil, and in those provinceswhere the weather is hot; for the seed, they say,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> if put in theground will keep, there being no moisture to spoil it, andwithin a single day after the next fall of rain, will make itsappearance above ground. Others, again, are of opinion thatsowing should begin about seven days after the setting of theVergiliæ, a period which is mostly followed by rain. Somethink that cold soils should be sown immediately after theautumnal equinox, and a warm soil later, so that the blademay not put forth too luxuriantly before winter.</p><p>It is universally agreed, however, that the sowing should<pb n="4073" />not be done about the period of the winter solstice; for thisvery good reason—the winter seeds, if put in before thewinter solstice, will make their appearance above ground onthe seventh day, whereas, if they are sown just after it, theywill hardly appear by the fortieth. There are some, however,who begin very early, and have a saying to justify their doingso, to the effect that if seed sown too early often disappoints,seed put in too late always does so. On the other hand, again,there are some who maintain that it is better to sow inspring than in a bad autumn; and they say that if they findthemselves obliged to sow in spring, they would choose theperiod that intervenes between the prevalence of the westwinds<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> and the vernal equinox. Some persons, however, takeno notice of the celestial phenomena, and only regulate theirmovements by the months. In spring they put in flax, theoat, and the poppy, up to the feast of the Quinquatria,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> as wefind done at the present day by the people of Italy beyond thePadus. There, too, they sow beans and winter-wheat in themonth of November, and spelt at the end of September, upto the ides of October:<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> others, however, sow this last afterthe ides of October, as late as the calends of November.<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span></p><p>The persons who do this take no notice, consequently, of thephænomena of Nature, while others, again, lay too much stressupon them, and hence, by these refined subtleties and distinctions,only add to their blindness; for here are ignorantrustics, not only dealing with a branch of learning, but thatbranch astronomy! It must still, however, be admitted thatthe observation of the heavens plays a very important part inthe operations of agriculture; and Virgil,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> we find, gives it ashis advice, that before any thing else, we should learn thetheory of the winds, and the revolutions of the stars; for, as hesays, the agriculturist, no less than the mariner, should regulatehis movements thereby. It is an arduous attempt, andalmost beyond all hope of success, to make an endeavour to introducethe divine science of the heavens to the uninformed<pb n="4074" />mind of the rustic; still, however, with a view to such vastpractical results as must be derived from this kind of knowledge, Ishall make the attempt. There are some astronomicaldifficulties, however, which have been experienced by thelearned even, that ought to be first submitted for consideration,in order that the mind may feel some encouragement on abandoning thestudy of the heavens, and may be acquainted withfacts at least, even though it is still unable to see into futurity.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In c. 8 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Georg. i. 208.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Georg. i. 227.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See c. 74 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Columella, B. ii. e. 8.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Favonius.
