Pains in those organs are allayed by injecting a bitch'smilk; and hardness of hearing is removed by using dogs' fat,with wormwood and old oil, or else goose-grease. Some persons add juice of onions and of garlic,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> in equal proportions.The eggs, too, of ants are used, by themselves, for this purpose;these insects being possessed, in fact, of certain medicinal properties, and bears, it is well known, curing themselves whensick, by eating<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> them as food. Goose-grease, and indeed thatof all birds, is prepared by removing all the veins and leavingthe fat, in a new, shallow, earthen vessel, well covered, to meltin the sun, some boiling water being placed beneath it; whichdone, it is passed through linen strainers, and is then put byin a cool spot, in a new earthen vessel, for keeping: with theaddition of honey it is less liable to turn rancid. Ashes ofburnt mice, injected with honey or boiled with oil of roses,allay pains in the ears. In cases where an insect has got intothe ears, a most excellent remedy is found in an injection ofmouse gall, diluted with vinegar; where, too, water has madeits way into the passages of the ear, goose-grease is used, in combination with juice of onions. Some persons skin a dormouse,and after removing the intestines boil the body in a new vesselwith honey. Medical men, however, prefer boiling it downto one-third with nard, and recommend it to be kept in thatstate, and to be warmed when wanted, and injected with asyringe. It is a well-known fact, that this preparation is an<pb n="5417" />effectual remedy for the most desperate maladies of the earsthe same, too, with an injection of earth-worms boiled withgoose-grease. The red worms, also, that are found upon trees,beaten up with oil, are a most excellent remedy for ulcerationsand ruptures of the ears. Lizards, which have been suspendedfor some time and dried, with salt in the mouth, are curativeof contusions of the ears, and of injuries inflicted by blows:the most efficacious for this purpose are those which have ironcoloured spots upon the skin,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and are streaked with linesalong the tail.</p><p>Millepedes, known also as "centipedes" or "multipedes,"are insects belonging to the earth-worm genus, hairy, withnumerous feet, forming curves as they crawl, and contractingthemselves when touched: the Greeks give to this insect thename of "oniscos,"<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> others, again, that of "tylos." Boiledwith leek-juice in a pomegranate rind, it is highly efficacious,they say, for pains in the ears; oil of roses being added tothe preparation, and the mixture injected into the ear oppositeto the one affected. As for that kind which does not describe acurve when moving, the Greeks give it the name of "seps,"while others, again, call it "scolopendra;" it is smaller than theformer one, and is injurious.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> The snails which are commonlyused as food, are applied to the ears with myrrh or powderedfrankincense; and those with a small, broad, shell are employedwith honey as a liniment for fractured ears. Old sloughs ofserpents, burnt in a heated potsherd and mixed with oil ofroses, are used as an injection for the ears, which is consideredhighly efficacious for all affections of those organs, and foroffensive odours arising there from in particular. In caseswhere there is suppuration of the ears, vinegar is used, and itis still better if goat's gall, ox-gall, or that of the sea tortoise, isadded. This slough, however, is good for nothing when morethan a year old; the same, too, when it has been drenched with<pb n="5418" />rain, as some think. The thick pulp of a spider's body, mixedwith oil of roses, is also used for the ears; or else the pulp appliedby itself with saffron or in wool: a cricket, too, is dug up withsome of its earth, and applied. Nigidius attributes great<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>virtues to this insect, and the magicians still greater, and allbecause it walks backwards, pierces the earth, and chirrups bynight! The mode of catching it is by throwing an ant,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> madefast with a hair, into its hole, the dust being first blown awayto prevent it from concealing itself: the moment it seizes theant, it is drawn out.</p><p>The dried craw of poultry, a part that is generally thrownaway, is beaten up in wine, and injected warm, for suppurations of the ears; the same, too, with the grease of poultry.</p><p>On pulling off the head of a black beetle,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> it yields a sortof greasy substance, which, beaten up with rose oil, is marvellously good, they say, for affections of the ears: care must betaken, however, to remove the wool very soon, or else this substance will be speedily transformed into an animal, in theshape of a small grub. Some writers assert that two or threeof these insects, boiled in oil, are extremely efficacious for theears; and that they are good, beaten up and applied in linen,for contusions of those organs.</p><p>This insect, also, is one of those that are of a disgustingcharacter; but I am obliged, by the admiration which I feel forthe operations of Nature, and for the careful researches. of theancients, to enter somewhat more at large upon it on the present occasion. Their writers have described several varietiesof it; the soft beetle, for instance, which, boiled in oil, hasbeen found by experience to be a very useful liniment forwarts. Another kind, to which they have given the name of"mylœcon,"<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> is generally found in the vicinity of mills: deprived of the head, it has been found to be curative of leprosy—at least Musa<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> and Picton<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> have cited instances to that effect.<pb n="5419" />There is a third kind, again, odious for its abominable smell,and tapering at the posterior extremities. Used in combination with pisselæon,<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> it is curative, they say, of ulcers of adesperate nature, and, if kept applied for one-and-twenty days,for scrofulous sores and inflamed tumours. The legs and wingsbeing first removed, it is employed for the cure of bruises, contusions, cancerous sores, itch-scabs, and boils—remedies, all ofthem, quite disgusting even to hear of. And yet, by Hercules!Diodorus<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> tells us that he has administered this remedy internally, with resin and honey, for jaundice and hardness ofbreathing; such unlimited power has the medical art to prescribe as a remedy whatever it thinks fit!</p><p>Physicians who keep more within bounds, recommend theashes of these insects to be kept for these various purposes in abox made of horn; or else that they should be bruised and injectedin a lavement for hardness of breathing and catarrhs. At allevents, that, applied externally, they extract foreign substancesadhering to the flesh, is a fact well known.</p><p>Honey, too, in which the bees have died, is remarkably useful for affections of the ears. Pigeons' dung, applied by itself,or with barley-meal or oat-meal, reduces imposthumes of theparotid glands; a result which is equally obtained by injectinginto the ear an owlet's brains or liver, mixed with oil, or byapplying the mixture to the parotid glands; also, by applyingmillepedes with one-third part of resin; by using crickets in theform of a liniment; or by wearing crickets attached to the bodyas an amulet. The other kinds of maladies, and the severalremedies for them, derived from the same animals or from othersof the same class, we shall describe in the succeeding Book.</p><p>SUMMARY.—Remedies, narratives, and observations, sixhundred and twenty-one.</p><p>ROMAN AUTHORS QUOTED.—M.
