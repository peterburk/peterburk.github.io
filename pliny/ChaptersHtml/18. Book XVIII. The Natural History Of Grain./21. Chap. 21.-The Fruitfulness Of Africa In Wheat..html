<div2 type="chapter" n="21" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 21.—THE FRUITFULNESS OF AFRICA IN WHEAT.</head><p>There is no grain more prolific than wheat, Nature havingbestowed upon it this quality, as being the substance which shedestined for the principal nutriment of man. A modius of<pb n="4036" />wheat, if the soil is favourable, as at Byzacium,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> a champaigndistrict of Africa, will yield as much as one hundred and fifty<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>modii of grain. The procurator of the late Emperor Augustussent him from that place—a fact almost beyond belief—littleshort of four hundred shoots all springing from a single grain;and we have still in existence his letters on the subject. Ina similar manner, too, the procurator of Nero sent him threehundred and sixty stalks all issuing from a single grain.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> Theplains of Leontium in Sicily, and other places in that island,as well as the whole of Bætica, and Egypt more particularly,yield produce a hundred-fold. The most prolific kinds ofwheat are the ramose wheat,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and that known as the "hun-dred-grain"<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> wheat. Before now, as many as one hundredbeans, too, have been found on a single stalk.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xvii. c. 3.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We know of no such fruitfulness as this in the wheat of Europe.Fiüeen-fold, as Fée remarks, is the utmost amount of produce that can beanticipated.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Fée mentions instances of 150, 92, and 63 stalks arising from a singlegrain; but all these fall far short of the marvæls here mentioned byPliny.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Triticum composition of Linnæus; supposed to have originallycome from Egypt or Barbary.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Centigranium."
