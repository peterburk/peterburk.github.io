<div2 type="chapter" n="9" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 9. (4.)—WHICH WAS THE FIRST STATUE OF A GOD MADE OFBRASS AT ROME. THE ORIGIN OF STATUES, AND THE RESPECTPAID TO THEM.</head><p>But after some time the artists everywhere applied themselvesto representations of the gods. I find that the firstbrass image, which was made at Rome, was that of Ceres;and that the expenses were defrayed out of the property thatbelonged to Spurius Cassius, who was put to death by his ownfather, for aspiring to the regal office.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> The practice, however,soon passed from the gods to the statues and representationsof men, and this in various forms. The ancients stainedtheir statues with bitumen, which makes it the more remarkablethat they were afterwards fond of covering them withgold. I do not know whether this was a Roman invention;but it certainly has the repute of being an ancient practice atRome.</p><p>It was not the custom in former times to give the likenessof individuals, except of such as deserved to be held in lastingremembrance on account of some illustrious deed; in the firstinstance, for a victory at the sacred games, and more particularlythe Olympic Games, where it was the usage for the victorsalways to have their statues consecrated. And if any one wasso fortunate as to obtain the prize there three times, his statue<pb n="6155" />was made with the exact resemblance of every individuallimb; from which circumstance they were called "iconicæ."<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>I do not know whether the first public statues were not erectedby the Athenians, and in honour of Harmodius and Aristogiton,who slew the tyrant;<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> an event which took place inthe same year in which the kings were expelled from Rome.This custom, from a most praiseworthy emulation, was afterwardsadopted by all other nations; so that statues wereerected as ornaments in the public places of municipal towns,and the memory of individuals was thus preserved, theirvarious honours being inscribed on the pedestals, to be readthere by posterity, and not on their tombs alone. After sometime, a kind of forum or public place came to be made in privatehouses and in our halls, the clients adopting this methodof doing honour to their patrons.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We have an account of this event in Livy, B. ii. c. 41, in ValeriusMaximus, and in Dionysius of Halicarnassus.—B.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Iconicæ," "portrait statues," from <foreign lang="greek">e)/ikwn</foreign>, of the same meaning.This term is employed by Suetonius, in speaking of a statue of Caligula,c. 22.—B.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pisistratus.
