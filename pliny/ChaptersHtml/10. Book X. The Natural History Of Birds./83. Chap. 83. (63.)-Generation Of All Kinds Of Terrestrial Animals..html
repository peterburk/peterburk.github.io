<div2 type="chapter" n="83" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 83. (63.)—GENERATION OF ALL KINDS OF TERRESTRIALANIMALS.</head><p>The only one among the bipeds that is viviparous is man.Man is the only animal that repents of his first embraces; sadaugury, indeed, of life, that its very origin should thus causerepentance! Other animals have stated times in the year fortheir embraces; but man, as we have already<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> observed, em-<pb n="2541" />ploys for this purpose all hours both of day and night; otheranimals become sated with venereal pleasures, man hardlyknows any satiety. Messalina,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> the wife of Claudius Cæsar,thinking this a palm quite worthy of an empress, selected, forthe purpose of deciding the question, one of the most notoriousof the women who followed the profession of a hired prostitute; and the empress outdid her, after continuous intercourse,night and day, at the twenty-fifth embrace. In the humanrace also, the men have devised various substitutes for the morelegitimate exercise of passion, all of which outrage Nature;while the females have recourse to abortion. How much moreguilty than the brute beasts are we in this respect! Hesiodhas stated that men are more lustful in winter, women insummer.</p><p>Coupling is performed back to back by the elephant, thecamel, the tiger, the lynx, the rhinoceros, the lion, the dasy-pus, and the rabbit, the genital parts of all which animals liefar back. Camels even seek desert places, or, at all events,spots of a retired nature; and to come upon them on such anoccasion is not unattended with danger. Coupling, with them,lasts a whole day; the only animal, indeed, of all those withsolid hoofs, with which such is the case. Among the quadrupeds, it is the smell that excites the passions of the male. Inthis act, dogs also, seals, and wolves turn back to back, andremain attached, though greatly against their will. In thegreater part of the animals above mentioned, the femalessolicit the males; in some, however, the males the females.As to bears, they lie down, like the human race, as previously<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> mentioned by us; while hedgehogs embrace standingupright. In cats, the male stands above, while the femaleassumes a crouching posture; foxes lie on the side, the femaleembracing the male. In the case of the cow and the hind,the female is unable to endure the violence of the male, consequently she keeps in motion during the time of coupling.The buck goes from one hind to another in turn, and thencomes back to the first. Lizards couple entwined around eachother, like the animals without feet.</p><p>All animals, the larger they are in bulk, are proportionablyless prolific: the elephant, the camel, and the horse produce<pb n="2542" />but one, while the acanthis,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> a very small bird, producestwelve. Those animals, also, which are the most prolific, arethe shortest time in breeding. The larger an animal is, thelonger is the time required for its formation in the womb;those, also, which are the longest-lived, require the longestgestation; the growing age, too, is not suitable for the purposesof generation. Those animals which have solid hoofs bear buta single young one, while those which have cloven hoofs beartwo. Those, again, whose feet are divided into toes, have astill more numerous offspring; but, while the others bringforth their young perfect, these last bear them in an unformedstate, such, for instance, as the lioness and the she—Bear. Thefox also brings forth its young in an even more imperfect statethan these; it is a very uncommon thing, however, to find itwhelping. After the birth, these animals warm their youngby licking them, and thereby give them their proper shape;they mostly produce four at a birth.</p><p>The dog, the wolf, the panther, and the jackal produce theiryoung blind. There are several kinds of dogs; those ofLaconia,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> of both sexes, are ready for breeding in the eighthmonth, and the females carry their young sixty or sixty-threedays at most; other dogs are fit for breeding when only sixmonths old; the female, in all cases, becomes pregnant at thefirst congress. Those which have conceived before the properage, bear pups which are longer blind, though not all thesame number of days. It is thought that dogs, in general,lift the leg when they water at six months old; this, too, islooked upon as a sign that they have attained their full growthand strength; when doing this, the female squats. The mostnumerous litters known consist of twelve, but more generallyfive or six is the number; sometimes, indeed, only one is pro-dued, but then it is looked upon as a prodigy, and the sameis the case, too, when all the pups are of one sex. In the dog, themales come into the world first, but in other animals, the twosexes are born alternately. The female admits the male againsix months after she has littered. Those of the Laconian breedbear eight young ones. It is a peculiarity in this kind, thatafter undergoing great labour, the males are remarkable fortheir salacity. In the Laconian breed the male lives ten<pb n="2543" />years, the female twelve; while other kinds, again, live fifteenyears, and sometimes as much as twenty; but they are notfit for breeding to the end of their life, as they generally ceaseat about the twelfth year. The cat and the ichneumonare, in other respects,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> like the dog; but they only live sixyears.</p><p>The dasypus<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> brings forth every month in the year, and issubject to superfœtation, like the hare. It conceives immediately after it has littered, even though it is still suckling itsyoung, which are blind at their birth. The elephant, as wehave already<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> stated, produces but one, and that the size of acalf three months old. The gestation of the camel lasts twelvemonths; the female conceives when three years old, andbrings forth in the spring; at the end of a year from thattime, she is ready to conceive again. It is thought advisableto have the mare covered so soon as three days, and indeed,sometimes, only one, after she has foaled; and, however unwilling she may be, means are taken to compel her. It is believed also, that it is by no means an uncommon thing for awoman to conceive on the seventh day after her delivery. Itis recommended that the manes of mares should be cut, so as tohumble their pride, in order to make them submit to be coveredby the male ass; for when the mane is long, they are liable tobe proud and vain. This is the only animal, the female ofwhich, after covering, runs, facing the north or the south, according as she has conceived a male or a female. They changetheir colour immediately after, and the hair becomes of aredder hue, and deeper, whatever the colour may naturally be;it is this that indicates that they must no longer be covered,and they, themselves, will even resist it. Gestation does not,however, preclude some of them from being worked, and theyare often with foal long before it is known. We read thatthe mare of Echecrates, the Thessalian, conquered at theOlympic games, while with foal.</p><p>Those who are more careful enquirers into these matters, tellus that in the horse, the dog, and the swine, the males aremost ardent for sexual intercourse in the morning, while thefemale seeks the society of the male after mid-day. They say<pb n="2544" />also, that mares in harness desire the horse sixty days soonerthan those that live in herds; that it is swine only that foamat the mouth during the time of coupling; and that a boar, ifit hears the voice of a sow in heat, will refuse to take its food,—to such a degree, indeed, as to starve itself, if it is not allowed to cover—while the female is reduced to such a state offrantic madness, as to attack and tear a man, more especially ifwearing a white garment. This frenzy, however, is appeasedby sprinkling vinegar on the sexual parts. It is supposed alsothat salacity is promoted by certain aliments; the herb rocket,for instance, in the case of man, and onions in that of cattle.Wild animals that have been tamed, do not conceive, the goose,for instance; the wild boar and the stag will only produce latein life, and even then they must have been taken and tamedwhen very young; a singular fact. The pregnant females,among the quadrupeds, refuse the male, with the exception,indeed, of the mare and the sow; superfœtation, however,takes place in none but the dasypus and the hare.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">B. vii. c. 4.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Justly called by Juvenal, "meretricem Augustam," Sat. vi. 1. 118.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">B. viii. c. 54.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably the goldfinch.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A kind of large hound.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The number that they hear.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. vii. c. 81.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">B. viii. c. 10, and in the present Chapter.</p></body>
