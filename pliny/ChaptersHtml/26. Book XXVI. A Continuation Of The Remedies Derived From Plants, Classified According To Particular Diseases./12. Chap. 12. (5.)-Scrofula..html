(5.)—SCROFULA.</head><p>For the cure of scrofula<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> plantago is employed, chelidonia<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>mixed with honey and axle-grease, cinquefoil, and root of per-<pb n="5162" />solata<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>—this last being applied topically, and covered with theleaf of the plant—artemisia,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> also, and an infusion of theroot of mandragora<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> in water. The large-leaved sideritis,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>cleft by the left hand with a nail, is worn attached as anamulet: but after the cure has been effected, due care must betaken to preserve the plant, in order that it may not be setagain, to promote the wicked designs of the herbalists and socause the disease to break out afresh; as sometimes happens inthe cases already mentioned,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> and others which I find stated,in reference to persons cured by the agency of artemisia orplantago.</p><p>Damasonion,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> also known as alcea, is gathered at the summersolstice, and applied with rain-water, the leaves being beatenup, or the root pounded, with axle-grease, so as to admit, whenapplied, of being covered with a leaf of the plant. The sameplan is adopted also for the cure of all pains in the neck, andtumours on all parts of the body.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Fée remarks that none of the plants here mentioned are of any utilityfor the cure of scrofula.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxv. c. 50.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxv. c. 66.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxv. c. 36.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxv. c. 94.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxv. c. 19, where our author has confused the Achillea with the Sideritis; also c. 15, where he describes the Heraclion siderion. Féeidentifies the Sideritis mentioned in B. xxv. c. 19, as having a square stemand leaves like those of the quercus, with the Stachys heraclea of modernbotany. That mentioned in the same Chapter, as having a fetid smell, heidentifies with the Phellandrium mutellina of Linnæus. The large-leavedSideritis is, no doubt, the one mentioned as having leaves like those ofthe quercus.
