<div2 type="chapter" n="5" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 5.—THE QUANTITY OF GOLD POSSESSED BY THE ANCIENTS.</head><p>At Rome, for a long period of time, the quantity of goldwas but very small. At all events, after the capture of theCity by the Gauls, when peace was about to be purchased, notmore than one thousand pounds' weight of gold could be collected.I am by no means unaware of the fact that in thethird<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> consulship of Pompeius there was lost from the throneof Jupiter Capitolinus two thousand pounds' weight of gold,originally placed there by Camillus; a circumstance which hasled most persons to suppose, that two thousand pounds' weightwas the quantity then collected. But in reality, this excessof one thousand pounds was contributed from the spoil takenfrom the Gauls, amplified as it was by the gold of which theyhad stripped the temples, in that part of the City which theyhad captured.</p><p>The story of Torquatus,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> too, is a proof that the Gauls werein the habit of wearing ornaments of gold when engaged incombat;<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> from which it would appear that the sum takenfrom the Gauls themselves, and the amount of which they hadpillaged the temples, were only equal to the amount of goldcollected for the ransom, and no more; and this is what wasreally meant by the response given by the augurs, that JupiterCapitolinus had rendered again the ransom twofold.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> As we<pb n="6076" />were just now speaking on the subject of rings, it may be aswell to add, by way of passing remark, that upon the officer<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>in charge of the Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus being arrested,he broke the stone of his ring between his teeth,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> and expiredupon the spot, thus putting an end to all possibility of discoveringthe perpetrator of the theft.</p><p>It appears, therefore, that in the year of the City 364, whenRome was captured by the Gauls, there was but two thousandpounds' weight of gold, at the very most; and this, too, at aperiod when, according to the returns of the census, there werealready one hundred and fifty-two thousand five hundred andseventy-three free citizens in it. In this same city, too, threehundred and seven years later, the gold which C. Marius theyounger<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> conveyed to Præneste from the Temple of the Capitolwhen in flames, and all the other shrines, amounted to thirteenthousand pounds' weight, such being the sum that figured in theinscriptions at the triumph of Sylla; on which occasion it wasdisplayed in the procession, as well as six thousand pounds'weight of silver. The same Sylla had, the day before, displayedin his triumph fifteen thousand pounds' weight of gold,and one hundred and fifteen thousand pounds' weight of silver,the fruit of all his other victories.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The reading in most MSS. is the "fourth consulship." This, however,is an error which has been rectified by the Bamberg and some otherMSS. Pompey was but <hi rend="ital">thrice</hi> consul. M. Crassus was the person generallyaccused of the act of robbery here alluded to.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Who took the golden tore (torques) from the Gaul whom he slew;whence his name.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Cum auro pugnare solitos."</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Quod equidem in augurio intellectum est, cum Capitolinus duplumreddidisset." The meaning of this passage is obscure, and cannot withcertainty be ascertained. Holland renders it, "To the light and knowledgewhereof we come by means of revelation from Augurie, which gaveus to understand, that Jupiter Capitolinus had rendered again the foresaidsumme in duple proportion." Littré gives a similar translation. Ajassontranslates it, "This, at least, is what we may presume, from the fact ofthere being discovered double the amount expected;" following the explanationgiven by Hardouin.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The "ædituus," or "temple keeper."
