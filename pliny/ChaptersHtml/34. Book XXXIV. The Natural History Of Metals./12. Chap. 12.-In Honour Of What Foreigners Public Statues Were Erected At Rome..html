It is wonderful that thesenate should then have preferred Pythagoras to Socrates, who,in consequence of his wisdom, had been preferred to all othermen<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> by the god himself; as, also, that they should have preferredAlcibiades for valour to so many other heroes; or, indeed,any one to Themistocles, who so greatly excelled in both qualities.The reason of the statues being raised on columns, was,that the persons represented might be elevated above othermortals; the same thing being signified by the use of arches,a new invention which had its origin among the Greeks. Iam of opinion that there is no one to whom more statues wereerected than to Demetrius Phalereus<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> at Athens: for therewere three hundred and sixty erected in his honour, therebeing reckoned at that period no more days in the year: these,however, were soon broken to pieces. The different tribeserected statues, in all the quarters of Rome, in honour ofMarius Gratidianus, as already stated;<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> but they were allthrown down by Sylla, when he entered Rome.<pb n="6160" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A.U.C. 441.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. vii. c. 31.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">His life has been written by Diogenes Laertius, and he is mentionedby Cicero, de Fin.
