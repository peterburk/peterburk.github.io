<div2 type="chapter" n="54" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 54.—OTHER PLANTS WHICH REQUIRE TO BE SOWN AT THEAUTUMNAL EQUINOX.</head><p>There are some other plants, again, which require to besown together at the time of the autumnal equinox; coriander,for instance, anise, orage, mallows, lapathum, chervil, known tothe Greeks as "pæderos,"<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and mustard,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> which has so pun-gent a flavour, that it burns like fire, though at the same timeit is remarkably wholesome for the body. This last, thoughit will grow without cultivation, is considerably improved bybeing transplanted; though, on the other hand, it is extremelydifficult to rid the soil of it when once sown there, the seedwhen it falls germinating immediately. This seed, whencooked in the saucepan,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> is employed even for making ragouts,its pungency being rendered imperceptible by boiling; theleaves, too, are boiled just the same way as those of othervegetables.</p><p>There are three different kinds of mustard,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> the first of athin, slender form, the second, with a leaf like that of therape, and the third, with that of rocket: the best seed comesfrom Egypt. The Athenians have given mustard the name of"napy,"<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> others, "thapsi,"<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> and others, again, "saurion."<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Lad's love."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Black mustard, Fée thinks.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He can hardly mean a pottage made of boiled mustard-seed alone,as Fée seems to think.
