The stone that is known as "porus,"<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> issimilar to Parian marble in hardness and whiteness, but is notso heavy. Theophrastus mentions also a transparent stonethat is found in Egypt, and is similar to stone of Chios inappearance; it is by no means improbable that it may haveexisted in his time, for stones, we know, disappear, and newkinds are discovered. The stone of Assos,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> which is saltishto the taste, modifies the attacks of gout, the feet being placedin a vessel made of it for the purpose; in addition to which,<pb n="6358" />in the quarries of this stone, all maladies of the legs disappear,whereas, in mines in general, the legs become affected withdisease. "Flower of stone of Assos" is the name given toa soft stone which crumbles into dust, and is found very efficaciousin some cases; it resembles red pumice in appearance.In combination with Cyprian wax, this stone is curative of affectionsof the mamill¾; and, employed with pitch or resin, itdisperses scrofulous sores and inflammatory tumours. Used inthe form of an electuary, it is good for phthisis, and, with honey,it causes old sores to cicatrize, and consumes proud flesh. Itis used, also, for the cure of wounds of an obstinate natureinflicted by animals, and acts as a desiccative upon suppurations.Plaisters, too, are made of it for gout, bean-meal beingincorporated with it for the purpose.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Both of them varieties of calcareous tufa, Ajasson thinks.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Both of them varieties of calcareous tufa, Ajasson thinks.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or Sarcophagus: see the preceding Chapter.</p></body>
