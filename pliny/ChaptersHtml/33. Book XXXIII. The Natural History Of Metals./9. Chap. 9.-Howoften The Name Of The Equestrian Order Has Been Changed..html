<div2 type="chapter" n="9" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 9.—HOWOFTEN THE NAME OF THE EQUESTRIAN ORDERHAS BEEN CHANGED.</head><p>Indeed, the name itself of the equites even, has been frequently changed, and that too, in the case of those who onlyowed their name to the fact of their service on horseback.Under Romulus and the other kings, the equites were knownas "Celeres,"<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> then again as "Flexuntes,"<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and after thatas "Trossuli,"<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> from the fact of their having taken a certaintown of Etruria, situate nine miles on this side of Volsinii,without any assistance from the infantry; a name too whichsurvived till after the death of C. Gracchus.<pb n="6086" /></p><p>At all events, in the writings left by Junius, who, from hisaffection for C. Gracchus, took the name of Gracchanus,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> wefind the following words—"As regards the equestrian order,its members were formerly called 'Trossuli,' but at thepresent day they have the name of 'Equites;' because it isnot understood what the appellation 'Trossuli' really means,and many feel ashamed at being called by that name."<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>—He<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>then goes on to explain the reason, as above mentioned, andadds that, though much against their will, those persons arestill called "Trossuli."</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">According to Livy, B. i. c. 15, the Celeres were three hundred Romanknights whom Romulus established as a body-guard. Their name, probably,was derived from the Greek <foreign lang="greek">ke/lhs</foreign>, a "war-horse," or "charger,"and the body consisted, no doubt, of the patricians in general, or such ofthem as could keep horses. Another origin assigned to the appellation is"Celer," the name of a chieftain, who was a favourite of Romulus. Theadjective "celer," "swift," owes its origin, probably, to the title of thesehorsemen.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A title derived, possibly, as Delafosse suggests, "a flectendis habenis,"from "managing the reins."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Called "Trossum" or "Trossulum," it is supposed. The remainsof a town are still to be seen at Trosso, two miles from Montefiascone inTuscany. The Greek word <foreign lang="greek">trwcalli\s</foreign>, a "cricket," and the Latin "torosulus,""muscular," have been suggested as the origin of this name.Ajasson suggests the Latin verb "truso," to "push on," as its origin.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See the end of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From the ambiguous nature of the name, it being in later times anexpression of contempt, like our word "fop," or "beau." In this lattersense, Salmasius derives it from the Greek <foreign lang="greek">trusso\s</foreign>, "effeminate."</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This concluding passage is omitted in most editions.</p></body>
