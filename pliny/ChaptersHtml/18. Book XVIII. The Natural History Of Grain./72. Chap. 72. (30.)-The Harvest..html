<div2 type="chapter" n="72" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 72. (30.)—THE HARVEST.</head><p>The mode of getting in the harvest varies considerably. Inthe vast domains of the provinces of Gaul a large hollowframe,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> armed with teeth and supported on two wheels, isdriven through the standing corn, the beasts being yoked<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>behind it; the result being, that the ears are torn off andfall within the frame. In other countries the stalks are cutwith the sickle in the middle, and the ears are separated bythe aid of paddle-forks.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> In some places, again, the corn istorn up by the roots; and it is asserted by those who adoptthis plan, that it is as good as a light turning up for the ground,whereas, in reality, they deprive it of its juices.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> There aredifferences in other respects also: in places where they thatchtheir houses with straw, they keep the longest haulms for thatpurpose; and where hay is scarce, they employ the straw forlitter. The straw of panic is never used for thatching, andthat of millet is mostly burnt; barley-straw, however, isalways preserved, as being the most agreeable of all as a foodfor oxen. In the Gallic provinces panic and millet are gathered,ear by ear, with the aid of a comb carried in the hand.</p><p>In some places the corn is beaten out by machines<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> uponthe threshing-floor, in others by the feet of mares, and in<pb n="4104" />others with flails. The later wheat is cut, the more prolific<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>it is; but it is got in early, the grain is finer and stronger.The best rule is to cut it before the grain hardens, and justas it is changing colour:<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> though the oracles on husbandrysay that it is better to begin the harvest two days too soonthan two days too late. Winter and other wheat must betreated exactly the same way both on the threshing-floor andin the granary. Spelt, as it is difficult to be threshed, shouldbe stored with the chaff on, being only disengaged of the strawand the beard.</p><p>Many countries make use of chaff<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> for hay: the smootherand thinner it is, and the more nearly resembling dust, thebetter; hence it is that the chaff<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> of millet is considered thebest, that of barley being the next best, and that of wheat theworst of all, except for beasts that are hard worked. In stonyplaces they break the haulms, when dry, with staves, for thecattle to lie upon: if there is a deficiency of chaff, the strawas well is ground for food. The following is the method employed inpreparing it: it is cut early and sprinkled with baysalt,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> after which it is dried and rolled up in trusses, and givento the oxen as wanted, instead of hay. Some persons set fireto the stubble in the fields, a plan that has been greatly extolledby Virgil:<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> the chief merit of it is that the seed of theweeds is effectually destroyed. The diversity of the methodsemployed in harvesting mainly depends upon the extent of thecrops and the price of labour.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Palladius gives a long description of this contrivance, which seems tohave been pushed forward by the ox; the teeth, which were sharp at theedge and fine at the point, catching the ears and tearing them off. But,as Fée says, the use of it must have been very disadvantageous, inconsequence of the unequal height of the stalks. The straw, too, wassacrificed by the employment of it.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In contrarium juncto.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Merges." Supposed to be the same as the "batillum" of Varro.Its form is unknown, and, indeed, the manner in which it was used. It isnot improbable that it was a fork, sharp at the edge, and similar to anopen pair of scissars, with which the heads of corn were driven off, as itwere; this, however, is only a mere conjecture. By the use of "atque,"it would almost appear that the "merges" was employed after the sicklehad been used; but it is more probable that he refers to twodifferent methods of gathering the ears of corn.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The roots and the stubble are, in reality, as good as a manure to theland.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Called "tribulum;" a threshing-machine moved by oxen. Varro,De Re Rust. i. 52, gives a description of it.
