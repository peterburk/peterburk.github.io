<div2 type="chapter" n="17" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 17.—THE EGYPTIAN SPHINX.</head><p>In front of these pyramids is the Sphinx,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> a still morewondrous object of art, but one upon which silence has beenobserved, as it is looked upon as a divinity by the people ofthe neighbourhood. It is their belief that King Harmaïs wasburied in it, and they will have it that it was brought therefrom a distance. The truth is, however, that it was hewnfrom the solid rock; and, from a feeling of veneration, the faceof the monster is coloured red. The circumference of the head,measured round the forehead, is one hundred and two feet, thelength of the feet being one hundred and forty-three, and the<pb n="6337" />height, from the belly to the summit of the asp on the head,sixty-two.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span></p><p>The largest<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> Pyramid is built of stone quarried in Arabia:three hundred and sixty thousand men, it is said, were employedupon it twenty years, and the three were completed inseventy-eight years and four months. They are described bythe following writers: Herodotus,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> Euhemerus, Duris ofSamos, Aristagoras, Dionysius, Artemidorus, Alexander Polyhistor,Butoridas, Antisthenes, Demetrius, Demoteles, andApion. These authors, however, are disagreed as to the personsby whom they were constructed; accident having, with veryconsiderable justice, consigned to oblivion the names of thosewho erected such stupendous memorials of their vanity. Someof these writers inform us that fifteen hundred talents wereexpended upon radishes, garlic, and onions<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> alone.</p><p>The largest Pyramid occupies seven<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> jugera of ground, andthe four angles are equidistant, the face of each side being eighthundred and thirty-three<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> feet in length. The total heightfrom the ground to the summit is seven hundred and twenty-fivefeet, and the platform on the summit is sixteen feet anda-half in circuit. Of the second Pyramid, the faces of the foursides are each seven hundred and fifty-seven feet and a-half inlength.<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> The third is smaller than the others, but far moreprepossessing in appearance: it is built of Æthiopian stone,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span><pb n="6338" />and the face between the four corners is three hundred andsixty-three feet in extent. In the vicinity of these erections,there are no vestiges of any buildings left. Far and widethere is nothing but sand to be seen, of a grain somewhat likea lentil in appearance, similar to that of the greater part ofAfrica, in fact.</p><p>The most difficult problem is, to know how the materialsfor construction could possibly be carried to so vast a height.According to some authorities, as the building gradually advanced,they heaped up against it vast mounds of nitre<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> andsalt; which piles were melted after its completion, by introducingbeneath them the waters of the river. Others, again,maintain, that bridges were constructed, of bricks of clay, andthat, when the pyramid was completed, these bricks were distributedfor erecting the houses of private individuals. For<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>the level of the river, they say, being so much lower, watercould never by any possibility have been brought there by themedium of canals. In the interior of the largest Pyramidthere is a well, eighty-six cubits deep, which communicateswith the river, it is thought. The method of ascertaining theheight of the Pyramids and all similar edifices was discovered<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>by Thales of Miletus; he measuring the shadow at the hour ofthe day at which it is equal in length to the body projecting it.</p><p>Such are the marvellous Pyramids; but the crowning marvelof all is, that the smallest, but most admired of them—that wemay feel no surprise at the opulence of the kings—was built byRhodopis,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> a courtesan! This woman was once the fellow-slaveof Æsopus the philosopher and fabulist, and the sharer<pb n="6339" />of his bed; but what is much more surprising is, that a courtesanshould have been enabled, by her vocation, to amass suchenormous wealth.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It still exists, though the face is mutilated. It was disinterred fromthe sand by Belzoni, but is now again nearly covered. According to Cavaglia,the signature of the Historian Arrian was found inscribed on oneof the fore-paws, when it was disinterred.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This reading is, perhaps, preferable to the LXI. s, (61 1/2) of the BambergMS.
