<div2 type="chapter" n="5" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 5. (5.)—THE ONLY PERSONS THAT HAVE BEEN PRESENTED WITH THIS CROWN.</head><p>L. Siccius Dentatus<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> was presented with this crown butonce, though he gained as many as fourteen civic crowns, andfought one hundred and twenty battles, in all of which he wasvictorious—so rarely is it that an army has to thank a singleindividual only for its preservation! Some generals, however, have been presented with more than one of these crowns,P. Decius Mus,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> the military tribune, for example, who received one from his own army, and another from the troopswhich he had rescued<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> when surrounded. He testified by anact of devoutness in what high esteem he held such an honouras this, for, adorned with these insignia, he sacrificed a whiteox to Mars, together with one hundred red oxen, which hadbeen presented to him by the beleaguered troops as the recompense of his valour: it was this same Decius, who afterwards,when consul, with Imperiosus<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> for his colleague, devoted hislife to secure victory to his fellow-citizens.</p><p>This crown was presented also by the senate and people ofRome—a distinction than which I know of nothing in existence more glorious—to that same Fabius<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> who restored thefortunes of Rome by avoiding a battle; not, however, on theoccasion when he preserved the master of the horse<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> and hisarmy; for then it was deemed preferable by those who wereindebted to him for their preservation to present him with acrown under a new title, that of "father." The crown ofgrass was, however, awarded to him, with that unanimitywhich I have mentioned, after Hannibal had been expelledfrom Italy; being the only crown, in fact, that has hithertobeen placed upon the head of a citizen by the hands of thestate itself, and, another remarkable distinction, the only onethat has ever been conferred by the whole of Italy united.<pb n="4394" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. vii. c. 29.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xvi. c. <hi rend="ital">5.</hi></p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In the Samnite war.
