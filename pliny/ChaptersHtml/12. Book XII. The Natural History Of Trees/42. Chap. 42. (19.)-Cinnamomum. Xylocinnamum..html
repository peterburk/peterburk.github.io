<div2 type="chapter" n="42" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 42. (19.)—CINNAMOMUM.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> XYLOCINNAMUM.</head><p>Fabulous antiquity, and Herodotus<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> more particularly, haverelated that cinnamomum and cassia are found in the nests ofcertain birds, and principally that of the phœnix, in the districts where Father Liber was brought up; and that these substances either fall from the inaccessible rocks and trees inwhich the nests are built, in consequence of the weight of thepieces of flesh which the birds carry up, or else are broughtdown by the aid of arrows loaded with lead. It is said, also,<pb n="3138" />that cassia grows around certain marshes, but is protected bya frightful kind of bat armed with claws, and by winged serpents as well. All these tales, however, have been evidentlyinvented for the purpose of enhancing the prices of thesecommodities. Another story, too, bears them company, to theeffect that under the rays of the noon-day sun, the entirepeninsula exhales a certain indescribable perfume composed ofits numerous odours; that the breezes, as they blow from it,are impregnated with these odours, and, indeed, were the firstto announce the vicinity of Arabia to the fleets of Alexanderthe Great, while still far out at sea. All this, however, isfalse; for cinnamomum, or cinnamum, which is the same thing,grows in the country of the Æthiopians,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> who are united byintermarriages with the Troglodytæ. These last, after buyingit of their neighbours, carry it over vast tracts of sea, uponrafts, which are neither steered by rudder, nor drawn orimpelled by oars or sails. Nor yet are they aided by any of theresources of art, man alone, and his daring boldness, standingin place of all these; in addition to which, they choose thewinter season, about the time of the equinox, for their voyage,for then a south easterly wind is blowing; these winds guidethem in a straight course from gulf to gulf, and after theyhave doubled the promonotory of Arabia, the north east windcarries them to a port of the Gebanitæ, known by the name ofOcilia.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> Hence it is that they steer for this port in preference;and they say that it is almost five years before the merchants are able to effect their return, while many perish onthe voyage. In return for their wares, they bring back articles of glass and copper, cloths, buckles, bracelets, and necklaces; hence it is that this traffic depends more particularlyupon the capricious tastes and inclinations of the female sex.The cinnamon shrub<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> is only two cubits in height, at themost, the lowest being no more than a palm in height. It isabout four fingers in breadth, and hardly has it risen sixfingers from the ground, before it begins to put forth shoots and<pb n="3139" />suckers. It has then all the appearance of being dry andwithered, and while it is green it has no odour at all. The leaf islike that of wild marjoram, and it thrives best in dry localities,being not so prolific in rainy weather; it requires, also, to bekept constantly clipped. Though it grows on level ground, itthrives best among tangled brakes and brambles, and henceit is extremely difficult to be gathered. It is never gatheredunless with the permission of the god, by whom some supposeJupiter to be meant; the Æthiopians, however, call himAssabinus.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> They offer the entrails of forty-four oxen, goats,and rams, when they implore his permission to do so, but afterall, they are not allowed to work at it before sunrise or aftersunset. A priest divides the branches with a spear, and setsaside one portion of them for the god; after which, the dealerstores away the rest in lumps. There is another account given,which states that a division is made between the gatherers andthe sun, and that it is divided into three portions, after whichlots are twice drawn, and the share which falls to the sun isleft there, and forthwith ignites spontaneously.</p><p>The thinnest parts in the sticks, for about a palm in length,are looked upon as producing the finest cinnamon; the partthat comes next, though not quite so long, is the next best,and so on downwards. The worst of all is that which isnearest the roots, from the circumstance that in that partthere is the least bark, the portion that is the most esteemed:hence it is that the upper part of the tree is preferred, therebeing the greatest proportion of bark there. As for the wood,it is held in no esteem at all, on account of the acrid tastewhich it has, like that of wild marjoram; it is known asxylocinnamum.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> The price of cinnamomum is ten denarii perpound. Some writers make mention of two kinds of cinnamon, the white and the black: the white was the one that wasformerly preferred, but now, on the contrary, the black is heldin the highest estimation, and the mottled, even, is preferred tothe white. The most certain test, however, of the goodness ofcinnamon is its not being rough, and the fact that the pieceswhen rubbed together do not readily crumble to powder. Thatwhich is soft is more particularly rejected, which is the case,also, when the outer bark too readily falls off.<pb n="3140" /></p><p>The right of regulating the sale of the cinnamon belongssolely to the king of the Gebanitæ, who opens the market for itby public proclamation. The price of it was formerly as muchas a thousand denarii per pound; which was afterwards increasedto half as much again, in consequence, it is said, of the forestshaving been set on fire by the barbarians, from motives ofresentment; whether this took place through any injusticeexercised by those in power, or only by accident, has not beenhitherto exactly ascertained. Indeed, we find it stated bysome authors, that the south winds that prevail in these partsare sometimes so hot as to set the forests on fire. The Emperor Vespasianus Augustus was the first to dedicate in thetemples of the Capitol and the goddess Peace chaplets of cinnamon inserted in embossed<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> gold. I, myself, once saw in thetemple of the Palatium, which his wife Augusta<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> dedicated toher husband the late emperor Augustus, a root of cinnamonof great weight, placed in a patera of gold: from it drops usedto distil every year, which congealed in hard grains. It remained there until the temple was accidentally destroyed by fire.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The bark of the Cinnamomum Zeylanicum of the modern naturalists,the cinnamon-tree of Ceylon.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">B. iii.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. vi. c. 34.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. vi. c. 26.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">As Fée observes, this description does not at all resemble that of thecinnamon-tree of Ceylon, as known to us.
