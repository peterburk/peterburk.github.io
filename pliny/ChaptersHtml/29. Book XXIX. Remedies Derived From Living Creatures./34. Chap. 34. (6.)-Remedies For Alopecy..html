(6.)—REMEDIES FOR ALOPECY.</head><p>Where the hair has been lost through alopecy,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> it is madeto grow again by using ashes of burnt sheep's dung, with oil ofcyprus<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and honey; or else the hoof of a mule of either sex,burnt to ashes and mixed with oil of myrtle. In addition to thesesubstances, we find our own writer, Varro, mentioning mousedung, which he calls "muscerda,"<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and the heads of flies,applied fresh, the part being first rubbed with a fig-leaf.Some recommend the blood of flies, while others, again, applyashes of burnt flies for ten days, in the proportion of one partof the ashes to two of ashes of papyrus or of nuts. In othercases, again, we find ashes of burnt flies kneaded up withwoman's milk and cabbage, or, in some instances, with honeyonly. It is generally believed that there is no creature lessdocile or less intelligent than the fly; a circumstance whichmakes it all the more marvellous that at the sacred games atOlympia, immediately after the immolation of the bull inhonour of the god called "Myiodes,"<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> whole clouds of themtake their departure from that territory. A mouse's head ortail, or, indeed, the whole of the body, reduced to ashes, is acure for alopecy, more particularly when the loss of the hair hasbeen the result of some noxious preparation. The ashes of ahedge-hog, mixed with honey, or of its skin, applied with tar,are productive of a similar effect. The head, too, of this lastanimal, reduced to ashes, restores the hair to scars upon thebody; the place being first prepared, when this cure is madeuse of, with a razor and an application of mustard: somepersons, however, prefer vinegar for the purpose. All theproperties attributed to the hedge-hog are found in the porcupine in a still higher degree.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span></p><p>A lizard burnt, as already<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> mentioned, with the fresh rootof a reed, cut as fine as possible, to facilitate its being re-<pb n="5409" />duced to ashes, and then mixed with oil of myrtle, willprevent the hair from coming off. For all these purposesgreen lizards are still more efficacious, and the remedy is rendered most effectual, when salt is added, bears' grease, andpounded onions. Some persons boil ten green lizards in tensextarii of oil, and content themselves with rubbing the placewith the mixture once a month. Alopecy is also cured veryspeedily with the ashes of a viper's skin, or by an applicationof fresh poultry dung. A raven's egg, beaten up in a coppervessel and applied to the head, previously shaved, imparts ablack colour to the hair; care must be taken, however, to keepsome oil in the mouth till the application is quite dry, or elsethe teeth will turn black as well. The operation must be performed also in the shade, and the liniment must not be washedoff before the end of three days. Some persons employ theblood and brains of a raven, in combination with red wine;while others, again, boil down the bird, and put it, at bedtime,in a vessel made of lead. With some it is the practice, forthe cure of alopecy, to apply bruised cantharides with tar, theskin being first prepared with an application of nitre:—itshould be remembered, however, that cantharides are possessedof caustic properties, and due care must be taken not to letthem eat too deep into the skin. For the ulcerations thus produced, it is recommended to use applications made of the heads,gall, and dung of mice, mixed with hellebore and pepper.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">So called from <foreign lang="greek">a)lwph\c,</foreign> "a fox," an animal very subject to the lessof its hair.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xii. c. 51.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">So swine's dung was called "sucerda," and cowdung "bucerda."</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or Maagrus, the "fly catcher," the name of a hero, invoked at Aliphera, at the festivals of Athena, as the protector against flies.
