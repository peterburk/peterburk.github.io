(1.)ÑTHE OSTRICH.</head><p>THE history of the birds<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> follows next, the very largest ofwhich, and indeed almost approaching to the nature of quad-rupeds, is the ostrich<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> of Africa or<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> ®thiopia. This bird exceedsin height a man sitting on horseback, and can surpass him inswiftness, as wings have been given to aid it in running; inother respects ostriches cannot be considered as birds, and donot raise themselves from the earth. They have cloven talons,very similar to the hoof<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> of the stag; with these they fight, andthey also employ them in seizing stones for the purpose of<pb n="2479" />throwing<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> at those who pursue them. They have the marvellous property of being able to digest<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> every substance withoutdistinction, but their stupidity<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> is no less remarkable; for although the rest of their body is so large, they imagine, whenthey have thrust their head and neck into a bush, that the wholeof the body is concealed. Their eggs<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> are prized on accountof their large size, and are employed as vessels for certain purposes, while the feathers of the wing and tail are used as ornaments for the crest and helmet of the warrior.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier remarks, that the accounts given by the ancients of birds, areenveloped in greater obscurity than their information on quadrupeds, orfishes. The quadrupeds, he says, are not so numerous, and are known fromtheir characteristics. The fishes also, which the ancients so highly esteemedas an article of food, were well known to them in general, and they haverepeated occasions to speak of them: but as to the birds, the augurs weretheir principal informants. Pliny, in fact, often quotes their testimony;and we find, from what he says, that these men had not come to any agreement among themselves as to what were the names of divers species ofbirds, the movements of which announced, according to them, the success ormisfortune of states equally with individuals. This portion, in fact, of theworks of Pliny, Cuvier remarks, is an excellent commentary on the remarkof Cicero, who, an augur himself, asked the question, how two augurs couldlook each other in the face without laughing. There are also several passages from Aristotle, who has, however, given but very little attention tothe exterior characteristics of birds: it is only from the similarity of theirhabits and present names that we are able, in many cases, to guess whatbird it is that is meant.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Struthiocamelus:" from the Greek, signifying a "little sparrow,"and a "camel." Cuvier remarks, that Pliny's description is correct, andthat he is only mistaken in a few slight particulars.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny perhaps here uses the conjunction "vel" in the explanatorysense of "otherwise;" intending to distinguish ®thiopian Africa from theRoman province of that name.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier remarks, that there is some truth in this, so far as that theostrich has only two toes, like the stag and other ruminating animals; butthen they are unequal in size, and not covered with hoofs.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Father Lobo, in his account of Abyssinia, says that when the ostrichis running at great speed, it throws the stones behind with such violence,that they would almost seem to be thrown at those in pursuit.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">An ostrich, Cuvier says, will swallow anything, but it is by no meansable to digest everything. He says, that he has seen ostriches with thestomach ruptured by nails which they have swallowed, or dreadfully tornby pieces of glass.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It has been remarked by Diodorus Siculus, B. ii., that so far from displaying stupidity in acting thus, it adopts a wise precaution, its head beingits most weak and defenceless part.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier states that its egg is equal to twenty-four to twenty-eightfowls' eggs, and that he had frequently eaten of them, and found them verydelicate.</p></body>
