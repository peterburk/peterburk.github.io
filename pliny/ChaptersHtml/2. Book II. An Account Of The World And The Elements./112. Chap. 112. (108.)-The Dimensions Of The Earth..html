<div2 type="chapter" n="112" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 112. (108.)ÑTHE DIMENSIONS OF THE EARTH.</head><p>Our part of the earth, of which I propose to give an account, floating as it were in the ocean which surrounds it(as I have mentioned above<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>), stretches out to the greatestextent from east to west, viz. from India to the Pillars consecrated to Hercules at Gades, being a distance of 8568miles<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>, according to the statement of Artemidorus<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>, or ac-<pb n="1144" />cording to that of Isidorus<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, 9818 miles. Artemidorus addsto this 491 miles, from Gades, going round by the SacredPromontory, to the promontory of Artabrum<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>, which is themost projecting part of Spain.</p><p>This measurement may be taken in two directions. Fromthe Ganges, at its mouth, where it discharges itself into theEastern ocean, passing through India and Parthyene, toMyriandrus<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>, a city of Syria, in the bay of Issus, is a distance of 5215 miles<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>. Thence, going directly by sea, by theisland of Cyprus, Patara in Lycia, Rhodes, and Astypal¾a,islands in the Carpathian sea, by T¾narum in Laconia,Lilyb¾um in Sicily and Calaris in Sardinia, is 2103 miles.Thence to Gades is 1250 miles, making the whole distancefrom the Eastern ocean 8568 miles<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>.</p><p>The other way, which is more certain, is chiefly by land.From the Ganges to the Euphrates is 5169 miles; thence toMazaca, a town in Cappadocia, is 319 miles; thence, throughPhrygia and Caria, to Ephesus is 415 miles; from Ephesus,across the ®gean sea to Delos, is 200 miles; to the Isthmusis 212 1/2 miles; thence, first by land and afterwards by thesea of Lech¾um and the gulf of Corinth, to Patr¾ in Peloponnesus, 90 miles; to the promontory of Leucate 87 1/2 miles;as much more to Corcyra; to the Acroceraunian mountains132 1/2, to Brundisium 87 1/2, and to Rome 360 miles. To theAlps, at the village of Scingomagum<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>, is 519 miles; throughGaul to Illiberis at the Pyrenees, 927; to the ocean and the<pb n="1145" />coast of Spain, 331 miles; across the passage of Gades 7 1/2miles; which distances, according to the estimate of Artemidorus, make altogether 8945 miles.</p><p>The breadth of the earth, from south to north, is commonlysupposed to be about one-half only of its length, viz. 4490miles; hence it is evident how much the heat has stolen fromit on one side and the cold on the other: for I do not suppose that the land is actually wanting, or that the earth hasnot the form of a globe; but that, on each side, the uninhabitable parts have not been discovered. This measurethen extends from the coast of the ®thiopian ocean, themost distant part which is habitable, to Mero‘, 1000 miles<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>;thence to Alexandria 1250; to Rhodes 562; to Cnidos 87 1/2;to Cos 25; to Samos 100; to Chios 94; to Mitylene 65; toTenedos 44; to the promontory of Sig¾um 12 1/2; to the entrance of the Euxine 312 1/2; to the promontory of Carambis350; to the entrance of the Palus M¾otis 312 1/2; and to themouth of the Tanais 275 miles, which distance, if we wentby sea, might be shortened 89 miles. Beyond the Tanaisthe most diligent authors have not been able to obtain anyaccurate measurement. Artemidorus supposes that everything beyond is undiscovered, since he confesses that, aboutthe Tanais, the tribes of the Sarmat¾ dwell, who extendtowards the north pole. Isidorus adds 1250 miles, as thedistance to Thule<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>; but this is mere conjecture. For mypart, I believe that the boundaries of Sarmatia really extendto as great a distance as that mentioned above: for if itwere not very extensive, how could it contain the innumerable tribes that are always changing their residence ? Andindeed I consider the uninhabitable portion of the world tobe still greater; for it is well known that there are innu-<pb n="1146" />merable islands lying off the coast of Germany<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>, which havebeen only lately discovered.</p><p>The above is all that I consider worth relating about thelength and the breadth of the earth<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>. But Eratosthenes<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>,a man who was peculiarly well skilled in all the more subtleparts of learning, and in this above everything else, and aperson whom I perceive to be approved by every one, hasstated the whole of this circuit to be 252,000 stadia, which,according to the Roman estimate, makes 31,500 miles. Theattempt is presumptuous, but it is supported by such subtlearguments that we cannot refuse our assent. Hipparchus<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>,whom we must admire, both for the ability with which hecontroverts Eratosthenes, as well as for his diligence in everything else, has added to the above number not much lessthan 25,000 stadia.</p><p>(109.) Dionysodorus is certainly less worthy of confidence<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span>; but I cannot omit this most remarkable instance ofGrecian vanity. He was a native of Melos, and was celebrated for his knowledge of geometry; he died of old age inhis native country. His female relations, who inherited hisproperty, attended his funeral, and when they had for severalsuccessive days performed the usual rites, they are said tohave found in his tomb an epistle written in his own nameto those left above; it stated that he had descended fromhis tomb to the lowest part of the earth, and that it was adistance of 42,000 stadia. There were not wanting certaingeometricians, who interpreted this epistle as if it had beensent from the middle of the globe, the point which is at thegreatest distance from the surface, and which must necessarilybe the centre of the sphere. Hence the estimate has beenmade that it is 252,000 stadia in circumference.<pb n="1147" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In the 66th chapter of this book.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In the estimate of distances I have given the numbers as they occurin the text of Lemaire, although, in many cases, there is considerabledoubt as to their accuracy.
