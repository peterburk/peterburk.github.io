<div2 type="chapter" n="6" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 6.—JEWELS DISPLAYED AT ROME IN THE TRIUMPH OFPOMPEIUS MAGNUS.</head><p>But it was this conquest by Pompeius Magnus that firstintroduced so general a taste for pearls and precious stones;just as the victories, gained by L. Scipio<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and Cneius Manlius,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>had first turned the public attention to chased silver,Attalic tissues, and banquetting-couches decorated with bronze;and the conquests of L. Mummius had brought Corinthianbronzes and pictures into notice.</p><p>(2.) To prove more fully that this was the case, I will heregive the very words of the public Registers<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> with referenceto the triumphs of Pompeius Magnus. On the occasion of histhird triumph, over the Pirates and over the Kings and nationsof Asia and Pontus that have been already enumerated in theSeventh Book<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> of this work, M. Piso and M. Messala being<pb n="6391" />consuls,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> on the day before<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> the calends of October, the anniversaryof his birth, he displayed in public, with its pieces,a chess-board,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> made of two precious stones, three feet inwidth by two in length—and to leave no doubt that the resourcesof Nature do become exhausted, I will here observe,that no precious stones are to be found at the present day, at allapproaching such dimensions as these; as also that there wasupon this board a moon of solid gold, thirty pounds in weight!—three banquetting-couches; vessels for nine waiters, ingold and precious stones; three golden statues of Minerva,Mars, and Apollo; thirty-three crowns adorned with pearls;a square mountain of gold, with stags upon it, lions, and allkinds of fruit, and surrounded with a vine of gold; as also amusæum,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> adorned with pearls, with an horologe<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> upon thetop of it.</p><p>There was a likeness also in pearls of Pompeius himself, hisnoble countenance, with the hair thrown back from the forehead,delighting the eye. Yes, I say, those frank features, sovenerated throughout all nations, were here displayed in pearls!the severity of our ancient manners being thus subdued, andthe display being more the triumph of luxury than the triumphof conquest. Never, most assuredly, would Pompeius have solong maintained his surname of "Magnus" among the men ofthat day, if on the occasion of his first<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> conquest his triumphhad been such as this. Thy portrait in pearls, O Magnus! thoseresources of prodigality, that have been discovered for thesake of females only! Thy portrait in pearls, refinements inluxury, which the Roman laws would not have allowed thee towear even! And was it in this way that thy value must be appreciated?Would not that trophy have given a more truthful likenessof thee which thou hadst erst erected upon the Pyrenæan<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>mountain heights? Assuredly such a portrait as this had beenno less than a downright ignominy and disgrace, were we notbound to behold in it a menacing presage of the anger of thegods, and to see foreshadowed thereby the time when that head,now laden with the wealth of the East, was to be displayed,severed from the body.<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span><pb n="6392" /></p><p>But in other respects, how truly befitting the hero was thistriumph! To the state, he presented two thousand millions ofsesterces; to the legati and quæstors who had exerted themselvesin defence of the sea coast, he gave one thousand millionsof sesterces; and to each individual soldier, six thousand sesterces.He has rendered, however, comparatively excusablethe Emperor Caius,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> who, in addition to other femmine luxuries,used to wear shoes adorned with pearls; as also theEmperor Nero, who used to adorn his sceptres with masksworked in pearls, and had the couches, destined for his pleasures,made of the same costly materials. Nay, we have no longer anyright, it would seem, to censure the employment of drinking-cupsadorned with precious stones, of various other articles indaily use that are similarly enriched, and of rings that sparklewith gems: for what species of luxury can there be thought of,that was not more innocent in its results than this on the part ofPompeius?</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxxiii c. 53.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxxiv. c. 8.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Acta."</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Chapter 7.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A.U.C. 693.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">30th of September</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Alveum lusorium."</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably meaning a shrine dedicated to the Muses.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. ii. c. 78, and B. vii. c. 60.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">That of Africa.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. vii. c. 27.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">As was the case, after the murder of Pompey in Egypt.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Caligula.</p></body>
