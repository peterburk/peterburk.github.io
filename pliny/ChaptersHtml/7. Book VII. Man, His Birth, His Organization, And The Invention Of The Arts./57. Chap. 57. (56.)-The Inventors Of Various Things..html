<div2 type="chapter" n="57" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 57. (56.)—THE INVENTORS OF VARIOUS THINGS.</head><p>Before we quit the consideration of the nature of man, itappears only proper to point out those persons who have beenthe authors of different inventions. Father Liber<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> was the firstto establish the practice of buying and selling; he also invented<pb n="2220" />the diadem, the emblem of royalty, and the triumphal procession. Ceres<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> introduced corn, the acorn having been previously used by man for food; it was she, also, who introducedinto Attica the art of grinding corn<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and of making bread,and other similar arts into Sicily; and it was from these circumstances that she came to be regarded as a divinity. Shewas the first also to establish laws;<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> though, according tosome, it was Rhadamanthus. I have always been of opinion,that letters were of Assyrian origin, but other writers, Gellius,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>for instance, suppose that they were invented in Egypt byMercury: others, again, will have it that they were discoveredby the Syrians; and that Cadmus brought from Phœnicia sixteen letters into Greece. To these, Palamedes, it is said, at thetime of the Trojan war, added these four, <foreign lang="greek">Q, C, F,</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">X.</foreign>Simonides,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> the lyric poet, afterwards added a like number,<foreign lang="greek">Z, H, Y,</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">W;</foreign> the sounds denoted by all of which are nowreceived into our alphabet.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span><pb n="2221" /></p><p>Aristotle, on the other hand, is rather of opinion, that therewere originally eighteen letters,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> <foreign lang="greek">A B G D E Z I K L M N O P R S T U F,</foreign>and that two, <foreign lang="greek">Q</foreign> namely and <foreign lang="greek">X,</foreign> were introducedby Epicharmus,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> and not by Palamedes. Aristides says, thata certain person of the name of Menos, in Egypt, invented letters fifteen years before the reign of Phoroneus,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> the most ancient of all the kings of Greece, and this he attempts to prove bythe monuments there. On the other hand, Epigenes,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> a writerof very great authority, informs us that the Babylonians havea series of observations on the stars, for a period of seven hundred and twenty thousand years, inscribed on baked bricks.Berosus and Critodemus, who make the period the shortest,give it as four hundred and ninety thousand years.<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> From<pb n="2222" />this statement, it would appear that letters have been in usefrom all eternity. The Pelasgi were the first to introduce theminto Latium.</p><p>The brothers Euryalus and Hyperbius,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> were the first whoconstructed brick-kilns and houses at Athens; before which,caves in the ground served for houses. Gellius<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> is inclined tothink that Toxius, the son of Cælus, was the first inventor ofmortar, it having been suggested to him by the nest of theswallow. Cecrops<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> gave to a town the name of Cecropia,after himself; this is now the citadel of Athens. Some persons will have it, that Argos had been founded before thisperiod by King Phoroneus; others, again, that Sicyon hadbeen previously built; while the Egyptians declare that theirown city, Diospolis, had been in existence long before them.Cinyra,<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> the son of Agriopas,<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> invented tiles and discovered<pb n="2223" />copper-mines,<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> both of them in the island of Cyprus; he alsoinvented the tongs, the hammer, the lever, and the anvil.Wells were invented by Danaus,<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> who came from Egypt intothat part of Greece which had been previously known as ArgosDipsion.</p><p>The first stone-quarries were opened by Cadmus at Thebes,or else, according to Theophrastus, in Phœnicia. Walls werefirst built by Thrason;<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> according to Aristotle, towers werefirst erected by the Cyclopes,<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> but according to Theophrastus,by the Tirynthii. The Egyptians invented weaving;<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> the<pb n="2224" />Lydians of Sardis the art of dyeing wool.<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span> Closter, the sonof Arachne, invented the spindle for spinning wool;<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span> Arachneherself, linen cloth and nets;<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span> Nicias of Megara, the art offulling cloth;<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span> and Tychius, the Bœotian, the art of makingshoes.<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span> The Egyptians will have it that the medical art wasfirst discovered among them, while others attribute it to Arabus,the son of Babylonis and Apollo; botany and pharmacy areascribed to Chiron, the son of Saturn and Philyra.<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span></p><p>Aristotle supposes that Scythes, the Lydian, was the firstto fuse and temper copper, while Theophrastus ascribes the artto Delas, the Phrygian.<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span> Some persons ascribe the working<pb n="2225" />of copper to the Chalybes, others to the Cyclopes. Hesiodsays, that iron was discovered in Crete, by the Idæan Dactyli.<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span>Erichthonius, the Athenian, or, as some people say, Æacus,discovered silver.<span id="ref_31"><a href="#note_31">[31]</a></span> Gold mines, and the mode of fusing thatmetal, were discovered by Cadmus, the Phœnician, at themountain of Pangæus,<span id="ref_32"><a href="#note_32">[32]</a></span> or, according to other accounts, byThoas or Eaclis, in Panchaia;<span id="ref_33"><a href="#note_33">[33]</a></span> or else by Sol, the son ofOceanus, whom Gellius mentions as having been the first whoemployed honey in medicine. Midacritus<span id="ref_34"><a href="#note_34">[34]</a></span> was the first whobrought tin from the island called Cassiteris.<span id="ref_35"><a href="#note_35">[35]</a></span> The Cyclopesinvented the art of working iron.<span id="ref_36"><a href="#note_36">[36]</a></span> Choræbus, the Athenian,was the first who made earthen vessels;<span id="ref_37"><a href="#note_37">[37]</a></span> but Anacharsis, the<pb n="2226" />Scthian, or, according to others, Hyperbius, the Corinthian,first invented the potter's wheel. Dædalus<span id="ref_38"><a href="#note_38">[38]</a></span> was the firstperson who worked in wood; it was he who invented the saw,the axe, the plummet, the gimlet, glue, and isinglass;<span id="ref_39"><a href="#note_39">[39]</a></span> thesquare, the level, the turner's lathe, and the key, were inventedby Theodorus, of Samos.<span id="ref_40"><a href="#note_40">[40]</a></span> Measures and weights were invented by Phidon, of Argos,<span id="ref_41"><a href="#note_41">[41]</a></span> or, according to Gellius, byPalamedes. Pyrodes, the son of Cilix, was the first to strikefire from the flint, and Prometheus taught us how to preserveit, in the stalk of giant-fennel.<span id="ref_42"><a href="#note_42">[42]</a></span></p><p>The Phrygians first taught us the use of the chariot withfour wheels;<span id="ref_43"><a href="#note_43">[43]</a></span> the Carthaginians the arts of merchandize,<span id="ref_44"><a href="#note_44">[44]</a></span> andEumolpus, the Athenian,<span id="ref_45"><a href="#note_45">[45]</a></span> the cultivation of the vine, and oftrees in general. Staphylus, the son of Silenus,<span id="ref_46"><a href="#note_46">[46]</a></span> was the first tomix water with wine; olive-oil and the oil-press, as also honey,we owe to Aristæus, the Athenian;<span id="ref_47"><a href="#note_47">[47]</a></span> the use of oxen and the<pb n="2227" />plough to Buzyges, the Athenian,<span id="ref_48"><a href="#note_48">[48]</a></span> or, according to other accounts, to Triptolemus.<span id="ref_49"><a href="#note_49">[49]</a></span></p><p>The Egyptians were the first who established a monarchicalgovernment, and the Athenians, after the time of Theseus,a democracy. Phalaris,<span id="ref_50"><a href="#note_50">[50]</a></span> of Agrigentum, was the first tyrant<span id="ref_51"><a href="#note_51">[51]</a></span>that existed; the Lacedæmonians were the introducers ofslavery;<span id="ref_52"><a href="#note_52">[52]</a></span> and the first capital punishment inflicted was ordered by the Areiopagus.<span id="ref_53"><a href="#note_53">[53]</a></span> The first battles were fought bythe Africans against the Egyptians, with clubs, which theyare in the habit of calling phalange. Prœtus and Acrisius<span id="ref_54"><a href="#note_54">[54]</a></span>were the first to use shields, in their contests with each other;or, as some say, Chalcus, the son of Athamas. Midias, theMessenian, invented the coat of mail, and the Lacedæmoniansthe helmet, the sword, and the spear.<span id="ref_55"><a href="#note_55">[55]</a></span> Greaves and crestswere first used by the Carians; Scythes, the son of Jupiter,it is said, invented the bow and arrows, though some saythat arrows were invented by Perses, the son of Perseus.<span id="ref_56"><a href="#note_56">[56]</a></span>Lances were invented by the Ætolians; the javelin, with the<pb n="2228" />thong<span id="ref_57"><a href="#note_57">[57]</a></span> attached, by Ætolus,<span id="ref_58"><a href="#note_58">[58]</a></span> the son of Mars; the spear ofthe light infantry<span id="ref_59"><a href="#note_59">[59]</a></span> by Tyrrhenus; the dart<span id="ref_60"><a href="#note_60">[60]</a></span> by Penthesilea,the Amazon; the axe by Pisæus; the hunting-spear, and thescorpion to hurl missiles, by the Cretans;<span id="ref_61"><a href="#note_61">[61]</a></span> the catapulta, thebalista,<span id="ref_62"><a href="#note_62">[62]</a></span> and the sling, by the Syrophœnicians.<span id="ref_63"><a href="#note_63">[63]</a></span> Pisæus, theTyrrhenian, was the first to invent the brazen trumpet,<span id="ref_64"><a href="#note_64">[64]</a></span> andArtemon, of Clazomenæ, the use of the testudo.<span id="ref_65"><a href="#note_65">[65]</a></span> The batter-<pb n="2229" />ing-horse, for the destruction of walls, which is at the presentday styled the "ram," was invented by Epeus, at Troy.<span id="ref_66"><a href="#note_66">[66]</a></span>Bellerophon was the first who mounted the horse;<span id="ref_67"><a href="#note_67">[67]</a></span> bridles andsaddles for the horse were invented by Pelethronius.<span id="ref_68"><a href="#note_68">[68]</a></span> TheThessalians, who are called. Centauri, and who dwell alongMount Pelion, were the first to fight on horse—Back. The peopleof Phrygia were the first who used chariots with two horses;Erichthonius first used four.<span id="ref_69"><a href="#note_69">[69]</a></span> Palamedes, during the Trojanwar, was the first who marshalled an army, and inventedwatchwords,<span id="ref_70"><a href="#note_70">[70]</a></span> signals, and the use of sentinels. Sinon, atthe same period, invented the art of correspondence by signals.Lycaon was the first to think of making a truce, and Theseusa treaty of alliance.</p><p>The art of divination by means of birds<span id="ref_71"><a href="#note_71">[71]</a></span> we owe to Car,<pb n="2230" />from whom Caria derives its name; Orpheus extended it toother animals. Delphus taught us the art of divining by theinspection of entrails; Amphiaraüs<span id="ref_72"><a href="#note_72">[72]</a></span> divination by fire; andTiresias, the Theban, presages from the entrails of birds. Weowe to Amphictyon<span id="ref_73"><a href="#note_73">[73]</a></span> the interpretation of portents and ofdreams, and to Atlas,<span id="ref_74"><a href="#note_74">[74]</a></span> the son of Libya, the art of astrology, orelse, according to other accounts, to the Egyptians or the Assyrians. Anaximander,<span id="ref_75"><a href="#note_75">[75]</a></span> the Milesian, invented the astronomical sphere; and Æolus, the son of Hellen, gave us the theoryof the winds.</p><p>Amphion was the inventor of music;<span id="ref_76"><a href="#note_76">[76]</a></span> Pan, the son ofMercury, the music of the reed, and the flute with the singlepipe; Midas, the Phrygian,<span id="ref_77"><a href="#note_77">[77]</a></span> the transverse flute;<span id="ref_78"><a href="#note_78">[78]</a></span> and Marsyas,<pb n="2231" />of the same country, the double-pipe.<span id="ref_79"><a href="#note_79">[79]</a></span> Amphion inventedthe Lydian measures in music; Thamyris the Thracian, theDorian, and Marsyas the Phrygian, the Phrygian style.<span id="ref_80"><a href="#note_80">[80]</a></span> Amphion, or, according to some accounts, Orpheus, and accordingto others, Linus, invented the lyre.<span id="ref_81"><a href="#note_81">[81]</a></span> Terpander, adding threeto the former four, increased the number of strings to seven;Simonides added an eighth, and Timotheus a ninth.<span id="ref_82"><a href="#note_82">[82]</a></span> Thamyris was the first who played on the lyre, without the accompaniment of the voice; and Amphion, or, as some say,Linus, was the first who accompanied it with the voice.Terpander was the first who composed songs expressly for thelyre; and Ardalus, the Trœzenian, was the first who taughtus how to combine the voice with the music of the pipe.<span id="ref_83"><a href="#note_83">[83]</a></span>The Curetes taught us the dance in armour,<span id="ref_84"><a href="#note_84">[84]</a></span> and Pyrrhus, thePyrrhic dance, both of them in Crete.</p><p>We are indebted to the Pythian oracle for the first heroicverse.<span id="ref_85"><a href="#note_85">[85]</a></span> A very considerable question has arisen, as to whatwas the origin of poetry; it is well known to have existedbefore the Trojan war. Pherecydes of Scyros, in the timeof King Cyrus, was the first to write in prose, and Cadmus,the Milesian, was the first historian.<span id="ref_86"><a href="#note_86">[86]</a></span><pb n="2232" /></p><p>Lycaon<span id="ref_87"><a href="#note_87">[87]</a></span> first instituted gymnastic games, in Arcadia;Acastus funereal games,<span id="ref_88"><a href="#note_88">[88]</a></span> at Iolcos;<span id="ref_89"><a href="#note_89">[89]</a></span> and, after him, Theseusinstituted them at the Isthmus.<span id="ref_90"><a href="#note_90">[90]</a></span> Hercules first institutedthe athletic contests at Olympia.<span id="ref_91"><a href="#note_91">[91]</a></span> Pythus invented thegame of ball.<span id="ref_92"><a href="#note_92">[92]</a></span> Painting was invented in Egypt by Gyges,the Lydian,<span id="ref_93"><a href="#note_93">[93]</a></span> or, according to Aristotle, in Greece, by Euchir, a<pb n="2233" />kinsman<span id="ref_94"><a href="#note_94">[94]</a></span> of Dædalus; according to Theophrastus, again, itwas invented by Polygnotus, the Athenian.</p><p>Danaüis was the first who passed over in a ship from Egyptto Greece.<span id="ref_95"><a href="#note_95">[95]</a></span> Before his time, they used to sail on rafts,<span id="ref_96"><a href="#note_96">[96]</a></span> whichhad been invented by King Erythras,<span id="ref_97"><a href="#note_97">[97]</a></span> to pass from one islandto another in the Red Sea. There are some writers to befound, who are of opinion that they were first thought ofby the Mysians and the Trojans, for the purpose of crossingthe Hellespont into Thrace. Even at the present day, theyare made in the British ocean, of wicker-work covered withhides;<span id="ref_98"><a href="#note_98">[98]</a></span> on the Nile they are made of papyrus, rushes, andreeds.</p><p>We learn from Philostephanus, that Jason was the firstperson who sailed in a long vessel;<span id="ref_99"><a href="#note_99">[99]</a></span> Hegesias says it was<pb n="2234" />Paralus, Ctesias,<span id="ref_100"><a href="#note_100">[100]</a></span> Semiramis,<span id="ref_101"><a href="#note_101">[101]</a></span> and Archemachus, Ægeon.According to Damastes,<span id="ref_102"><a href="#note_102">[102]</a></span> the Erythræi<span id="ref_103"><a href="#note_103">[103]</a></span> were the first toconstruct vessels with two banks of oars; according to Thucydides,<span id="ref_104"><a href="#note_104">[104]</a></span> Aminocles, the Corinthian, first constructed themwith three banks of oars; according to Aristotle, the Carthaginians, those with four banks; according to Mnesigiton,the people of Salamis, those with five banks;<span id="ref_105"><a href="#note_105">[105]</a></span> and, according toXenagoras, the Syracusans, those with six; those above six, asfar as ten, Mnesigiton says were first constructed by Alexanderthe Great. From Philostephanus, we learn that Ptolemy Sotermade them as high as twelve banks; Demetrius, the son ofAntigonus, with fifteen; Ptolemy Philadelphus, with thirty;and Ptolemy Philopater, who was surnamed Tryphon, withforty.<span id="ref_106"><a href="#note_106">[106]</a></span> Hippus, the Tyrian, was the first who inventedmerchant-ships; the Cyrenians, the pinnace; the Phœnicians,the passage—Boat; the Rhodians, the skiff; and the Cyprians,the cutter.<span id="ref_107"><a href="#note_107">[107]</a></span><pb n="2235" /></p><p>We are indebted to the Phœnicians for the first observation of the stars in navigation; the Copæ invented the oar,and the Platæans gave it its broad blade.<span id="ref_108"><a href="#note_108">[108]</a></span> Icarus was theperson who invented sails,<span id="ref_109"><a href="#note_109">[109]</a></span> and Dædalus the mast and yards;the Samians, or else Pericles, the Athenian, transports forhorses,<span id="ref_110"><a href="#note_110">[110]</a></span> and the Thracians, long covered vessels,<span id="ref_111"><a href="#note_111">[111]</a></span>—Beforewhich time they used to fight only from the prow or the stern.Pisæus, the Tyrrhenian, added the beak to ships;<span id="ref_112"><a href="#note_112">[112]</a></span> Eupalamus, the anchor; Anacharsis, that with two flukes; Pericles,the Athenian, grappling-irons, and hooks like hands;<span id="ref_113"><a href="#note_113">[113]</a></span> andTiphys,<span id="ref_114"><a href="#note_114">[114]</a></span> the helm and rudder.

The character in which shewas generally regarded by the writers of antiquity, was the one here givento her by Pliny; in proof of which we may refer, among other authorities,to Virgil, Geor. B. i. 1. 147, and to Ovid, Metam.

Most readers willbe aware, that the actual invention of letters, the share which the Egyptians and the Phœnicians had in it, the identification of Cadmus and stillmore of Mercury, with any of the heroes or legislators of antiquity, ofwhom we have any correct historical data, and the connection which theGreek alphabet had with those of other nations, are among the mostcurious questions of literary discussion, and are still far from being resolved with any degree of certainty.—B.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It seems to have been the general opinion, that the Greek languagehad, originally, sixteen or eighteen letters, the source of which was veryuncertain, and of high antiquity; and to these, additional letters were,from time to time, appended by different individuals. Upon the whole,the claim of the Egyptians to the invention of letters, seems to rest upon,at least, a very plausible foundation.—B.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Epicharmus was born in the fifth century B.C. , in the island of Cos,hut removed, probably at an early age, to Sicily, where he passed a considerable portion of his life. His original profession was that of a physician, but he appears to have devoted his attention principally to generalscience and literature, and is more especially remarkable as the inventorof regular comedy. A few fragments only of his dramas remain, but thetitles of no less than forty are preserved. From a line in the Prologue tothe Menæchmi of Plautus, where it is said that the plot of the play,"non Atticissat verum Sicilicissat" "is not Attic, but Sicilian;" it has beenconjectured, that Plautus took the plot of the piece from Epicharmus.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Phoroneus was the son of Inachus, and the second king of Argos; hebegan to reign about <date value="-1807" authname="-1807">1807</date> B.C.—B.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Epigenes has already been referred to in the fifty-fourth chapter ofthis Book.—B.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There has been much discussion respecting the interpretation of thispassage. In the first place, the numbers in the text have extended from720 and 490 to as many thousands, by the addition of the letter M.,against the authority, however, of some MSS. In the next place, inolder to curtail the enormous periods thus formed, the years have beensupposed to be only lunar, or even diurnal periods. The opinion of Hardouin and Marcus is perhaps the better founded, who reject the proposedalteration, and consider these numbers to indicate, according to theirnatural signification, periods of years. The principal consideration thathas been urged in favour of the alteration of the text is derived from twopassages in Cicero's Treatise de Divin.

Pyrrhus, from whom the dancereceived its name, was the son of Achilles.—B.</p><p><span id="note_85"><a href="#ref_85">85. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The honour of the invention has been given to Phemonoë, a priestessof the oracle of Delphi.—B.</p><p><span id="note_86"><a href="#ref_86">86. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Apuleius, Flor. B. ii. c. 15, says that Pherecydes was the first to dis-regard the fetters of verse, and to write in desultory language. Pliny,however, in B. v. c. 31, has ascribed the invention of prose to Cadmus.Hardouin endeavours to reconcile this inconsistency, by supposing thatCadmus was the first prose writer of history, and that Pherecydes firstapplied prose to philosophical subjects. But Cicero, De Orat. B. ii. c. 12,speaks of Pherecydes as a writer of simple annals.—B.</p><p><span id="note_87"><a href="#ref_87">87. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There are several persons of this name among the kings and heroesof the semi-fabulous periods; but the one here mentioned is said to havebeen the son of Phoroneus, and to have lived about <date value="-1400" authname="-1400">1400</date> B.C. Thesegames were celebrated in honour of Pan; the combatants were naked, andhad the body anointed with oil; the Lupercalia of the Romans, in manyrespects, resembled the games of Lycaon. We are informed by Livy, B. i.c. 5, that the Lupercalia were introduced into Italy by Evander, the Arcadian.—B. Ovid, in the Fasti, B. i., states to the same effect.</p><p><span id="note_88"><a href="#ref_88">88. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Iolcos was a city of Thessaly, from which place the Argonauts embarked on their expedition to Colchis; Acastus was one of them; thefunereal games which he instituted were in honour of his father, Pelias.—B.</p><p><span id="note_89"><a href="#ref_89">89. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. iv. c. 10.</p><p><span id="note_90"><a href="#ref_90">90. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Isthmian games were originally instituted by Sisyphus, king ofCorinth; after having been interrupted for some time, they were reestablished by Theseus, who celebrated them in honour of Neptune.—B.</p><p><span id="note_91"><a href="#ref_91">91. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">These were the celebrated Olympic games; Diodorus Siculus, B. iv. c. 3,Pausanias, and other ancient writers, as well as Pliny, ascribe their originto Hercules; Pausanias, however, says, that some supposed them to havebeen instituted by Jupiter.—B.</p><p><span id="note_92"><a href="#ref_92">92. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Pila lusoria." There have been many conjectures respecting theperson to whom this invention is attributed, as well as respecting thenature of the game itself; in either case it appears that we have nothingbut mere conjecture to direct our opinion.—B. Among the Romans, thegames with the "pila, or ball," were those played with the "pila trigonalis,"so called, probably, from the players standing in a triangle: the "follis"was a large ball inflated, and used for football. "Paganica" was a similarball, but harder, being stuffed with feathers, and used by rustics. "Harpastum" was a small ball, used by the Greeks, and was scrambled for onreaching the ground.</p><p><span id="note_93"><a href="#ref_93">93. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The MSS. differ as to the name of the person to whom the inventionof painting is ascribed; but, in those which are considered the most worthyof credit, he is called Gyges Ludius. Marcus endeavours to prove, thatthe term "Ludius" refers to the country of Lud or Ludim, to the south ofEgypt; and he points out some analogies between the name Gyges,and some words which are found in ancient inscriptions, or which are stillin use among the Nubians and Abyssinians. Pliny, B. xxxv. c. 5, attri-butes the invention of painting to the Egyptians, and says, that "it waspractised by them long before it was known in Greece."—B.</p><p><span id="note_94"><a href="#ref_94">94. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The term Euchir, <foreign lang="greek">Eu)/xeir,</foreign> which is literally "dextrous or handy,"would rather seem to be a prefix to a name, than a proper name itself.With respect to Polygnotus, and the share which he had in the inventionof painting, the reader may examine what Pliny says in a subsequent partof his work, B. xxxv. c. 35.—B.</p><p><span id="note_95"><a href="#ref_95">95. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The vessel in which Danaüs came into Greece, may, probably, havebeen of a much superior construction, or much larger than those previouslyseen in that country; but it is generally supposed, that Cecrops, Cadmus,and the other Egyptian and Phœnician colonists, had come by sea to Greece,long before the arrival of Danaüs. In the ancient Egyptian monumentsthere are representations of different kinds of vessels of considerable size,which would imply a knowledge of the art of navigation at a veryremote period.

Small vessels, not unlikethose here described by Pliny, were used very lately, by the fishermen inthe Bristol channel.—B. They are still used by the Welsh fishermen, andare made of oil-cloth or leather stretched on a frame.

Fromthe incidental remarks in the classical writers, and from the representationswhich still remain, particularly those on Trajan's Column, and on certaincoins, it would appear that they were disposed in stages, one above theother, and provided with oars of different lengths, in proportion to theirdistance from the water. But, although we may conceive that this wasthe case with two or three rows, it is impossible that a greater numbercould have been disposed in this manner.—B.</p><p><span id="note_107"><a href="#ref_107">107. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is not easy to determine what was the construction and form of thefour kinds of vessels here mentioned, which he designates respectively bythe terms "lembus," "cymba," "celes," and "cercurus." The "lem-bus" is mentioned by Livy, B. xxiv. c. 40, as a vessel with two benchesof oars, "biremis;" and in B. xl. c. 4, he describes it as a small vesselused for towing large ships. The "cymba" has been supposed to havebeen a still smaller vessel, answering to our idea of a common boat; the"celes," we may suppose, was named from "celer," being especiallyadapted for quick motion, and the "cercurus" from <foreign lang="greek">kerko\s,</foreign> "a tail," fromits long narrow form, or from its having a tail-like appendage attachedto it.—B.</p><p><span id="note_108"><a href="#ref_108">108. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hardouin conjectures, that the cities of Copæ and Platæ derived theirnames, respectively, from the inventions here ascribed to them, <foreign lang="greek">kwph\</foreign> and<foreign lang="greek">plath\.</foreign>—B.</p><p><span id="note_109"><a href="#ref_109">109. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pausanias ascribes this invention to Dædalus; Diodorus, B. v. c. 1, toÆolus, who gave his name to the Æolian islands.—B.</p><p><span id="note_110"><a href="#ref_110">110. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Hippagus."—B.</p><p><span id="note_111"><a href="#ref_111">111. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Tecta longa;" Cæsar, Bell.
