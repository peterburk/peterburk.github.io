<div2 type="chapter" n="80" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 80. (54.)—APES.</head><p>The different kinds of apes, which approach the nearest tothe human figure, are distinguished from each other by thetail.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> Their shrewdness is quite wonderful. It is said that,imitating the hunters, they will besmear themselves withbird-lime, and put their feet into the shoes, which, as so manysnares, have been prepared for them.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> Mucianus says, thatthey have even played at chess, having, by practice, learnedto distinguish the different pieces, which are made of wax.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span><pb n="2348" />He says that the species which have tails become quite melancholy when the moon is on the wane, and that they leapfor joy at the time of the new moon, and adore it. Otherquadrupeds also are terrified at the eclipses of the heavenlybodies. All the species of apes manifest remarkable affectionfor their offspring. Females, which have been domesticated,and have had young ones, carry them about and shew them toall comers, shew great delight when they are caressed, and appear to understand the kindness thus shewn them. Hence itis, that they very often stifle their young with their embraces.The dog's-headed ape<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> is of a much fiercer nature, as is thecase with the satyr. The callitriche<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> has almost a totallydifferent aspect; it has a beard on the face, and a tail, whichin the first part of it is very bushy. It is said that this animal cannot live except in the climate of Æthiopia, which isits native place.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Some of these animals are entirely without a tail, and this circumstance has been employed to form the primary division of the simile intothe two species, those with and those without tails. We have an epigram of Martial, in which this is referred to. "Si mihi cauda foret,cercopithecus eram"—"If I had but a tail, I should be a monkey." B.iv. Ep. 102.—B. See B. xi. c. 100.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We learn from Strabo, Ind. Hist. B. xv., that, in catching the monkey,the hunters took advantage of the propensity of these animals to imitateany action they see performed. "Two modes," he says, "are employed intaking this animal, as by nature it is taught to imitate every action, and totake to flight by climbing up trees. The hunters, when they see an apesitting on a tree, place within sight of it a dish full of water, with whichthey rub their eyes; and then, slyly substituting another in its place, full ofbird-lime, retire and keep upon the watch. The animal comes down fromthe tree, and rubs its eyes with the bird-lime, in consequence of which theeyelids stick together, and it is unable to escape." Ælian also says, Hist.Anim. B. xvii. c. 25, that the hunters pretend to put on their shoes, andthen substitute, in their place, shoes of lead; the animal attempts to imitatethem, and, the shoes being so contrived, when it has once got them on, itfinds itself unable to take them off, or to move, and is consequently taken.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There has been some difficulty in ascertaining the exact reading here; but the meaning seems to be, that the pieces were made of wax, and thatthe animals had learned to distinguish them from each other, and movethem in the appropriate manner; how far this is to be credited, it is noteasy to decide, but it would certainly require very strong and direct evidence. We are told that the Emperor Charles V. had a monkey thatplayed at chess with him.—B.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In the original, termed "cynocephali," "dog's-headed;" an appellation given to them, according to Cuvier, from their muzzle projecting likethat of a dog; we have an account of this species in Aristotle, Hist. Anim.B. ii. c. 13.—B. Probably the baboon. See B. vi. c. 35, and B. vii.c. 2. The satyr is, perhaps, the uran-utang. See B. v. c. 8, and B. vii. c. 2.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "fine-haired monkey;" supposed to be the Silenus of Linnæus; itis described by Buffon, under the name of Callitrix.—B. It seems to bealso called the "Simia hamadryas."</p></body>
