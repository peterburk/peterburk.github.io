(12.)—THE INVENTORS OF THE ART OF MODELLING.</head><p>On painting we have now said enough, and more than enough;but it will be only proper to append some accounts of theplastic art. Butades, a potter of Sicyon, was the first who invented,at Corinth, the art of modelling portraits in the earthwhich he used in his trade. It was through his daughter thathe made the discovery; who, being deeply in love with a youngman about to depart on a long journey, traced the profile ofhis face, as thrown upon the wall by the light of the lamp. Uponseeing this, her father filled in the outline, by compressing clayupon the surface, and so made a face in relief, which he thenhardened by fire along with other articles of pottery. Thismodel, it is said, was preserved in the Nymphæum<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> at Corinth,until the destruction of that city by Mummius.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> Others, again,assert that the first inventors of the plastic art were Rhœcus<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>and Theodorus,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> at Samos, a considerable period before the expulsionof the Bacchiadæ from Corinth: and that Damaratus,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>on taking to flight from that place and settling in Etruria, wherehe became father of Tarquinius, who was ultimately king ofthe Roman people, was accompanied thither by the modellersEuchir,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> Diopus, and Eugrammus, by whose agency the artwas first introduced into Italy.<pb n="6284" /></p><p>Butades first invented the method of colouring plastic compositions,by adding red earth to the material, or else modellingthem in red chalk: he, too, was the first to make masks on theouter edges of gutter-tiles upon the roofs of buildings; inlow relief, and known as "prostypa" at first, but afterwardsin high relief, or "ectypa." It was in these designs,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> too, thatthe ornaments on the pediments of temples originated;and from this invention modellers first had their name of"plastæ."</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or Temple of the Nymphs.
