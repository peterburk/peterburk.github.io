(15.)—MYRRH.</head><p>According to some authors, myrrh<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> is the produce of a treethat grows in the same forests as the incense-tree, thoughmost say that they grow in different places: but the fact isthat myrrh grows in many parts of Arabia, as will be seenwhen we come to speak of the several varieties of it. A sortthat is highly esteemed is brought from the islands<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> also, andthe Sabæi even cross the sea to procure it in the country ofthe Troglodytæ. It is grown also by being transplanted, andwhen thus cultivated is greatly preferred to that which isgrown in the forests. The plant is greatly improved by raking<pb n="3130" />and baring the roots; indeed, the cooler the roots are kept, thebetter it is.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is supposed to be the product of an amyris, but is not now esteemedas a perfume; but is used in medicine as a tonic. Forskhal has attributedto the Amyris kataf, or kafal, the production of myrrh. According toEhrenberg, a very similar tree, though constituting a different species, theBalsamodendrum myrrha, also produces this substance. It is importedinto Europe from both Abyssinia and Arabia. It was much used by theancients, to flavour their wines.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. vi. c. 32.</p></body>
