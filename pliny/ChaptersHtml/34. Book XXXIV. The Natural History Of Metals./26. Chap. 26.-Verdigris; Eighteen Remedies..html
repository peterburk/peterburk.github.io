Sometimes it is detached already formed,from the mineral from which copper is smelted: and sometimesit is made by piercing holes in white copper, and suspendingit over strong vinegar in casks, which are closed withcovers; it being much superior if scales of copper are used forthe purpose. Some persons plunge vessels themselves, madeof white copper, into earthen pots filled with vinegar, andscrape them at the end of ten days. Others, again, cover thevessels with husks of grapes,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and scrape them in the sameway, at the end of ten days. Others sprinkle vinegar uponcopper filings, and stir them frequently with a spatula in thecourse of the day, until they are completely dissolved. Othersprefer triturating these filings with vinegar in a brazenmortar: but the most expeditious method of all is to add tothe vinegar shavings of coronet copper.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> Rhodian verdigris,more particularly, is adulterated with pounded marble; somepersons use pumice-stone or gum.</p><p>The adulteration, however, which is the most difficult todetect, is made with copperas;<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> the other sophisticationsbeing detected by the crackling of the substance when bittenwith the teeth. The best mode of testing it is by using aniron fire-shovel; for when thus subjected to the fire, if pure,the verdigris retains its colour, but if mixed with copperas, itbecomes red. The fraud may also be detected by using a leafof papyrus, which has been steeped in an infusion of nut-galls;for it becomes black immediately upon the genuine verdigrisbeing applied. It may also be detected by the eye; the greencolour being unpleasant to the sight. But whether it is pureor adulterated, the best method is first to wash and dry it, andthen to burn it in a new earthen vessel, turning it over untilit is reduced to an ash;<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> after which it is pounded and put byfor use. Some persons calcine it in raw earthen vessels, untilthe earthenware becomes thoroughly baked: others again addto it male frankincense.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> Verdigris is washed, too, in the samemanner as cadmia.<pb n="6197" /></p><p>It affords a most useful ingredient for eye-salves, and fromits mordent action is highly beneficial for watery humours ofthe eyes. It is necessary, however, to wash the part withwarm water, applied with a fine sponge, until its mordencyis no longer felt.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"®rugo." The researches of modern chemists have ascertained thecomposition of verdigris to be a diacetete of copper; the sesquibasicacetate and the triacetate are also to be considered as varieties of thissubstance; we have an exact analysis of these salts in the "Elements" ofthe late Dr. Turner, the Sixth Edition, edited by Professor Liebig and Mr.W. Turner, pp. 931, 2. Most of the processes described in this Chapterare mentioned by Dioscorides.ÑB. See also Beckmann, Hist. Inv.
