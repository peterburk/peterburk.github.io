<div2 type="chapter" n="64" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 64.—REMEDIES FOR THE GOUT AND DISEASES OF THEFEET.</head><p>Sideritis,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> attached to the body as an amulet, reduces varicose veins, and effects a painless cure. Gout used to be anextremely rare disease, not in the times of our fathers andgrandfathers only, but within my own memory even. Indeed,it may justly be considered a foreign complaint; for if it hadbeen formerly known in Italy, it would surely have found aLatin name. It should, however, by no means be lookedupon as an incurable malady; for before now, in many instances, it has quitted the patient all at once, and still morefrequently, a cure has been effected by proper treatment.</p><p>For the cure of gout, roots of panaces<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> are used, mixed withraisins; juice of henbane, or the seed, combined with meal;scordion,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> taken in vinegar; iberis, as already mentioned;<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>vervain, beaten up with axle-greaseor root of cyclaminos,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>a decoction of which is good also for chilblains.</p><p>As cooling applications for gout, root of xiphion<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> is used;seed of psyllion;<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> hemlock, with litharge or axle-grease;and, at the first symptoms of red gout, or, in other words, hotgout, the plant aizoüm.<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> For either kind of gout, erigeron,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>with axle-grease, is very useful; leaves of plantago, beaten upwith a little salt; or argemonia,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> pounded with honey. An.application of vervain is also remedial, and it is a good planto soak the feet in a decoction of that plant in water.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxv. c. 19.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxv. c. 11, <hi rend="ital">et seq.</hi></p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxv. c. 27.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. xxv. c. 49.
