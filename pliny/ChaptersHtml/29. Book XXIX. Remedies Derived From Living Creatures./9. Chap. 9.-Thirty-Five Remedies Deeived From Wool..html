<div2 type="chapter" n="9" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 9.—THIRTY-FIVE REMEDIES DEEIVED FROM WOOL.</head><p>I shall begin then with some remedies that are well known,<pb n="5382" />those namely, which are derived from wool and from the eggs ofbirds, thus giving due honour to those substances which holdthe principal place in the estimation of mankind; though atthe same time I shall be necessitated to speak of some others outof their proper place, according as occasion may offer. I shouldnot have been at a loss for high-flown language with which tograce my narrative, had I made it my design to regard anything else than what, as being strictly trustworthy,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> becomesmy work: for among the very first remedies mentioned, wefind those said to be derived from the ashes and nest of thephœnix,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> as though, forsooth, its existence were a well ascertained fact, and not altogether a fable. And then besides, itwould be a mere mockery to describe remedies that can onlyreturn to us once in a thousand years.</p><p>(2.) The ancient Romans attributed to wool a degree of religious importance even, and it was in this spirit that they enjoinedthat the bride should touch the door-posts of her husband'shouse with wool. In addition to dress and protection from thecold, wool, in an unwashed state, used in combination with oil,and wine or vinegar, supplies us with numerous remedies, according as we stand in need of an emollient or an excitant, an astringent or a laxative. Wetted from time to time with these liquids,greasy wool is applied to sprained limbs, and to sinews that aresuffering from pain. In the case of sprains, some persons arein the habit of adding salt, while others, again, apply poundedrue and grease, in wool: the same, too, in the case of contusions or tumours. Wool will improve the breath, it is said,if the teeth and gums are rubbed with it, mixed with honey;it is very good, too, for phrenitis,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> used as a fumigation. Toarrest bleeding at the nose, wool is introduced into the nostrilswith oil of roses; or it is used in another manner, the earsbeing well plugged with it. In the case of inveterate ulcers it isapplied topically with honey: soaked in wine or vinegar, orin cold water and oil, and then squeezed out, it is used forthe cure of wounds.</p><p>Rams' wool, washed in cold water, and steeped in oil, isused for female complaints, and to allay inflammations of theuterus. Procidence of the uterus is reduced by using this wool<pb n="5383" />in the form of a fumigation. Greasy wool, used as a plasterand as a pessary, brings away the dead fœtus, and arrestsuterine discharges. Bites inflicted by a mad dog are pluggedwith unwashed wool, the application being removed at the endof seven days. Applied with cold water, it is a cure foragnails: steeped in a mixture of boiling nitre, sulphur, oil,vinegar, and tar, and applied twice a day, as warm as possible,it allays pains in the loins. By making ligatures with unwashed rams' wool about the extremities of the limbs, bleeding is effectually stopped.</p><p>In all cases, the wool most esteemed is that from the neck ofthe animal; the best kinds of wool being those of Galatia,Tarentum, Attica, and Miletus. For excoriations, blows,bruises, contusions, crushes, galls, falls, pains in the head andother parts, and for inflammation of the stomach, unwashedwool is applied, with a mixture of vinegar and oil of roses.Reduced to ashes, it is applied to contusions, wounds, andburns, and forms an ingredient in ophthalmic compositions. Itis employed, also, for fistulas and suppurations of the ears.For this last purpose, some persons take the wool as it is shorn,while others pluck it from the fleece; they then cut off theends of it, and after drying and carding it, lay it in pots ofunbaked earth, steep it well in honey, and burn it. Others,again, arrange it in layers alternately with chips of torchpine,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and, after sprinkling it with oil, set fire to it: theythen rub the ashes into small vessels with the hands, and letthem settle in water there. This operation is repeated and thewater changed several times, until at last the ashes are foundto be slightly astringent, without the slightest pungency; uponwhich, they are put by for use, being possessed of certaincaustic properties,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> and extremely useful as a detergent forthe eyelids.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He certainly does not always keep this object in view.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. x. c. 2, and 1. xii. c. 42.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A form of fever, Littré remarks, that is known by the moderns as"pseudo-continuous."</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xvi. c. 19.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Smectica" is suggested by Gesner, Hist.
