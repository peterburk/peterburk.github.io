<div2 type="chapter" n="18" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 18.—THE PHAROS.</head><p>There is another building, too, that is highly celebrated;the tower that was built by a king of Egypt, on the island ofPharos, at the entrance to the <span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> harbour of Alexandria. Thecost of its erection was eight hundred talents, they say; and,not to omit the magnanimity that was shown by King Ptolemæus<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>on this occasion, he gave permission to the architect,Sostratus<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> of Cnidos, to inscribe his name upon the edificeitself. The object of it is, by the light of its fires at night,to give warning to ships, of the neighbouring shoals, and topoint out to them the entrance of the harbour. At thepresent day, there are similar fires lighted up in numerousplaces, Ostia and Ravenna, for example. The only danger<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>is, that when these fires are thus kept burning without intermission,they may be mistaken for stars, the flames havingvery much that appearance at a distance. This architect 'isthe first person that built a promenade upon arches; at Cnidos,it is said.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The greater harbour, there being two at Alexandria.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ptolemy Lagus.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Supposed by Thiersch to have been the same person as the statuarymentioned in B. xxxiv. c. 19.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A risk that is now obviated, if, indeed, there is such a risk, by theuse of revolving lights and coloured lights.</p></body>
