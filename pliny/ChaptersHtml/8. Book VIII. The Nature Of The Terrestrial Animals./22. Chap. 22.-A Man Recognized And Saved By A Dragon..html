<div2 type="chapter" n="22" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 22.ÑA MAN RECOGNIZED AND SAVED BY A DRAGON.</head><p>Facts such as these induce us to give some credit to whatDemocritus relates, who says that a man, called Thoas, waspreserved in Arcadia by a dragon.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> When a boy, he had become much attached to it, and had reared it very tenderly;but his father, being alarmed at the nature and monstrous sizeof the reptile, had taken and left it in the desert. Thoas beinghere attacked by some robbers who lay in ambush, he wasdelivered from them by the dragon, which recognized his voiceand came to his assistance. But as to what has been saidrespecting infants that have been exposed and nourished bythe milk of wild beasts,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> as in the case of the founders of ourcity by a wolf, I am disposed to attribute such cases as theserather to the greatness of the destinies which have to be fulfilled, than to any peculiarity in the nature of the animalsthemselves.<pb n="2274" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This word here signifies, simply, a "serpent."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">®lian, Var. Hist. B. xiii. c. i., relates an occurrence of this kind, aboutAtalanta, and Justin. B. xliv. c. 4, about Habis, a king of Spain. As tothe account of Romulus having been suckled by a wolf, it was generally regarded as a legendary tale by the Romans themselves. See Livy, B. i. c.4, and Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Antiq. Rom. B. i.ÑB.</p></body>
