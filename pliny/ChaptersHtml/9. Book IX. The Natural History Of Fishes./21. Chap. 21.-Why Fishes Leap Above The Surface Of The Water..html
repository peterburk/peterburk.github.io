Fish will also do the sameat other times, when in dread of the violence of other fish, andmullets more especially, which are of such extraordinary swiftness, that they will sometimes leap over a ship, if lying cross-wise.<pb n="2391" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is, as Cuvier has remarked, a crustaceous insect of the parasiticalclass Lernæa, which are monoculcus [and form the modern class of theEpizoa]. Gmelin, he says, has called it "Pennatula filosa," though, in fact,it is not a pennatula [or polyp] at all. As Dalechamps observes, its ap-pearance is very different from that of a scorpion. Penetrating the fleshof the tunny or sword-fish, it almost drives the creature to a state ofmadness.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 19. Appian also, in his Halieutics, B ii.,makes mention of this animal. Pintianus remarks, that Athenæus, on reading this passage of Aristotle, read it not as "arachnes," but "drachmes;"not the size of a spider, but the weight of a "drachma," or Roman denarius.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or the emperor fish, Cuvier says, the Xiphias gladius of Linnæus.</p></body>
