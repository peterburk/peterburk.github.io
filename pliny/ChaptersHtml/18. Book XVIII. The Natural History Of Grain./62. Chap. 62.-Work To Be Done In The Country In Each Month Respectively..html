Where, too, the natureof the locality will allow it, the vines, and the trees upon whichthey are trained, should be lopped, and the soil turned up with<pb n="4082" />the mattock for seed plots; trenches, too, should be opened out,and the water drained from off the fields, and the presses<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>should be well washed and put away.
