(7.)ÑTHE BIRDS CALLED SANGUALIS AND IMMUSULUS.</head><p>There has been considerable argument among the Romanaugurs about the birds known as the "sangualis" and the"immusulus." Some persons are of opinion that the immusulus is the young of the vulture, and the sangualis that ofthe ossifrage. Massurius says,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> that the sangualis is the sameas the ossifrage, and that the immusulus is the young of theeagle, before the tail begins to turn white. Some personshave asserted that these birds have not been seen at Romesince the time of the augur Mucius; for my part, I think itmuch more likely, that, amid that general heedlessness as toall knowledge, which has of late prevailed, no notice has beentaken of them.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Festus says, also, that it is the ossifrage, and was so called from thegod Sancus.</p></body>
