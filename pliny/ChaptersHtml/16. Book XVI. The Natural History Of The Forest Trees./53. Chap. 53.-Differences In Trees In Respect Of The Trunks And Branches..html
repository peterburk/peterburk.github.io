<div2 type="chapter" n="53" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 53.—DIFFERENCES IN TREES IN RESPECT OF THE TRUNKSAND BRANCHES.</head><p>Some trees are of a simple form, and have but a single trunkrising from the root, together with numerous branches; suchas the olive, for instance, the fig, and the vine; others again areof a shrubby nature, such as the paliurus,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> the myrtle, andthe filbert; which last, indeed, is all the better, and themore abundant its fruit, the more numerous its branches. Insome trees, again, there is no trunk at all, as is the case withone species of box,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and the lotus<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> of the parts beyond sea.Some trees are bifurcated, while there are some that branchout into as many as five parts. Others, again, divide in thetrunk but have no branches, as in the case of the elder; whileothers have no division in the trunk but throw out branches,such as the pitch-tree, for instance.</p><p>In some trees the branches are symmetrically arranged, thepitch-tree and the fir, for example; while with others theyare dispersed without any order or regularity, as in the robur,the apple, and the pear. In the fir the branches are thrownout from the trunk straight upwards, pointing to the sky, andnot drooping downwards from the sides of the trunk. It isa singular thing,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> but this tree will die if the ends of itsbranches are cut, though, if taken off altogether, no bad effectis produced. If it is cut, too, below the place where thebranches were, the part of the tree which is left will continueto live; but if, on the other hand, the top only of the tree isremoved, the whole of it will die.<pb n="3392" /></p><p>Some trees, again, throw out branches from the roots, theelm for example; while others are branchy at the top, thepine for instance, and the lotus<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> or Grecian bean, the fruit ofwhich, though wild, resembles the cherry very closely, and iscalled the lotus at Rome, on account of its sweetness. Forsheltering houses these trees are more particularly esteemed,as they throw out their branches to a considerable distance,from a short trunk, thus affording a very extensive shade, andvery frequently encroaching upon the neighbouring mansions.There is no tree, however, the shade afforded by which is lesslong-lived than this, and when it loses its leaves in winter,it affords no shelter from the sun. No tree has a more sightlybark, or one which has greater attractions for the eye; orbranches which are longer, stouter, or more numerous; indeed, one might almost look upon them as forming so manytrees. The bark<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> of it is used for dyeing skins, and the rootfor colouring wool.</p><p>The branches of the apple-tree have a peculiar conformation;knots are formed which resemble the muzzles<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> of wild beasts,several smaller ones being united to a larger.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxiv. c. 71.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He means the garden or border-box mentioned in c. 28 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xiii. c. 17: the African lotus, probably; the Zizyphus lotusof Desfontaines.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This statement is entirely incorrect. If a tree loses the terminal bud,it will grow no higher, but it will not die if the extremities of the branchesare cut. Such, in fact, is much more likely to happen when they are <hi rend="ital">all</hi>cut off, from the extreme loss of juices which must naturally ensue at theseveral cicatrices united.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Celtis australis of Linnæus. Pliny is in error in calling this treethe "Grecian bean."
