THEPORPHYRIO.</head><p>Birds drink by suction; those which have a long neck takingtheir drink in a succession of draughts, and throwing the headback, as though they were pouring the water down thethroat. The porphyrio<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> is the only bird that seems to bite atthe water as it drinks. The same bird has also other peculiarities of its own; for it will every now and then dip its foodin the water, and then lift it with its foot to its bill, usingit as a hand. Those that are the most esteemed are found inCommagene. They have beaks and very long legs, of a redcolour.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Fulica porphyrio of Linnæus, the Poule sultane of Buffon.</p></body>
