Even after it has been kept so long as fifty<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>years, it retains its property of extinguishing a light; indeed,<pb n="4209" />it is the proper way of testing the genuineness of the drug tohold it to the flame and make it scintillate above and below,before finally extinguishing it. The elaterium which is pale,smooth, and slightly bitter, is superior<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> to that which has agrass-green appearance and is rough to the touch.</p><p>It is generally thought that the seed of this plant willfacilitate conception if a woman carries it attached to her person,before it has touched the ground; and that it has the effect ofaiding parturition, if it is first wrapped in ram's wool, and thentied round the woman's loins, without her knowing it, carebeing taken to carry it out of the house the instant she isdelivered.</p><p>Those persons who magnify the praises of the wild cucumber saythat the very best is that of Arabia, the next beingthat of Arcadia, and then that of Cyrenæ: it bears a resemblance tothe heliotropium,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> they say, and the fruit, about thesize of a walnut, grows between the leaves and branches. Theseed, it is said, is very similar in appearance to the tail ofa scorpion thrown back, but is of a whitish hue. Indeed,there are some persons who give to this cucumber the name of"scorpionium," and say that its seed, as well as the elaterium,is remarkably efficacious as a cure for the sting of the scorpion. Asa purgative, the proper dose of either is from halfan obolus to an obolus, according to the strength of the patient, alarger dose than this being fatal.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> It is in the sameproportions, too, that it is taken in drink for phthiriasis<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> anddropsy; applied externally with honey or old olive oil, it isused for the cure of quinsy and affections of the trachea.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Fée says that this is not the fact, as it speedily deteriorates bykeeping.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Fée says that this is not the fact, as it speedily deteriorates bykeeping.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From Theophrastus, Hist.
