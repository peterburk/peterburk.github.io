<div2 type="chapter" n="47" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 47. (13.)—VARIOUS KINDS OF EARTH. THE PUTEOLAN DUST,AND OTHER EARTHS OF WHICH CEMENTS LIKE STONE ARE MADE.</head><p>But there are other resources also, which are derived immediatelyfrom the earth. Who, indeed, cannot but be surprised<pb n="6289" />at finding the most inferior constituent parts of it, known as"dust"<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> only, on the hills about Puteoli, forming a barrieragainst the waves of the sea, becoming changed into stone themoment of its immersion, and increasing in hardness from dayto day—more particularly when mixed with the cement ofCumæ? There is an earth too, of a similar nature found inthe districts about Cyzicus; but there, it is not a dust, but asolid earth, which is cut away in blocks of all sizes, and which,after being immersed in the sea, is taken out transformed intostone. The same thing may be seen also, it is said, in thevicinity of Cassandrea;<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and at Cnidos, there is a spring offresh water which has the property of causing earth to petrifywithin the space of eight months. Between Oropus and Aulis,every portion of the land upon which the sea encroaches becomestransformed into solid rock.</p><p>The finer portion of the sand of the river Nilus is not verydifferent in its properties from the dust of Puteoli; not, indeed,that it is used for breaking the force of the sea and withstandingthe waves, but only for the purpose, forsooth, of subduing<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>the body for the exercises of the palestra! At all events,it was for this purpose that it used to be brought over forPatrobius,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> a freedman of the Emperor Nero. I find it statedalso, that Craterus, Leonnatus, and Meleager, generals of Alexanderthe Great, had this sand transported along with theirmunitions of war. But I forbear to enlarge any further uponthis subject; or indeed, by Hercules! upon those preparationsof earth and wax of which the ceromata are made, so muchemployed by our youth in their exercises of the body, at thecost of all vigour of the mind.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Pulvis."
