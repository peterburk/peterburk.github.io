<div2 type="chapter" n="23" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 23. (19.)ÑWHAT WINES IT IS NOT LAWFUL TO USE IN THE SACRED RITES.</head><p>As religion is the great basis of the ordinary usages of life,I shall here remark that it is considered improper to offerlibations to the gods with any wines which are the produce ofan unpruned vine, or of one that has been struck by lightningor near to which a dead man has been hung, or of grapes thathave been trodden out by sore Feet, or made of must fromhusks that have been cut,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> or from grapes that have beenpolluted by the fall of any unclean thing upon them. TheGreek wines are excluded also from the sacred ministrations,because they contain a portion of water.</p><p>The vine itself is sometimes eaten; the tops of the shoots<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>are taken off and boiled, and are then pickled in vinegar<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>and brine.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">After the grapes had been trodden and pressed, the husks were takenout and their edges cut, and then again subjected to pressure: the resultwas known as "tortivum," or "circumcisivum," a wine of very inferiorquality.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He alludes to the young shoots, which have an agreeable acidity,owing to acetic and tartaric acids.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Acetic acid; the result, no doubt, of the faulty mode of manufactureuniversally prevalent; their wines contained evidently but little alcohol.</p></body>
