(9.)ÑTHE METHOD BY WHICH THEY ARE TAMED.</head><p>Elephants of furious temper are tamed by hunger<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> andblows, while other elephants are placed near to keep them quiet,when the violent fit is upon them, by means of chains. Besides this, they are more particularly violent when in heat,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>at which time they will level to the ground the huts of theIndians with their tusks. It is on this account that they areprevented from coupling, and the females are kept in herds<pb n="2257" />separate from the males, just the same way as with othercattle. Elephants, when tamed, are employed in war, andcarry into the ranks of the enemy towers filled with armedmen; and on them, in a very great measure, depends the ultimate result of the battles that are fought in the East. Theytread under foot whole companies, and crush the men in theirarmour. The very least sound, however, of the grunting ofthe hog terrifies them:<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> when wounded and panic-stricken,they invariably fall back, and become no less formidable forthe destruction which they deal to their own side, than totheir opponents. The African elephant is afraid of the Indian,and does not dare so much as look at it, for the latter is ofmuch greater bulk.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We have the same account given by ®lian and by Strabo.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. vi. c. 18, remarks, that the violence of theanimal, which is produced by an accidental cause, as also that arising fromvenereal excitement, are counteracted by opposite modes of treatment; theone by depriving it of food, the other by over-feeding it; the former, inorder to break its strength, and the latter, to divert it into a differentchannel.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">®lian, Anim. Nat. B. i. c. 38, states that the Romans employed thismode of terrifying the elephants brought against them by Pyrrhus.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">That this was the general opinion among the ancients, we learn fromPolybius, ®lian, Livy, Diodorus Siculus, and others. Cuvier remarks,that this may have been the case with the animals from Barbary, or thenorth of Africa, but that it is not so with those from the middle or southof that continent.ÑB.</p></body>
