<div2 type="chapter" n="23" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 23.—SARDONYX; THE SEVERAL VARIETIES OF IT. DEFECTSIN THE SARDONYX.</head><p>Thus far we have spoken in reference to the stones, which,it is generally agreed, belong to the highest rank; in obedience,more particularly, to a decree<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> that has been passed by theladies to that effect. There is less certainty with respect tothose upon which the men as well have been left to form ajudgment; seeing that the value of each stone depends moreparticularly upon the caprice of the individual and the rivalrythat exists in reference thereto; as, for example, when ClaudiusCæsar was so much in the habit of wearing the smaragdus andthe sardonyx.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> The first Roman who wore a sardonyx, accordingto Demostratus, was the elder Africanus, since whose<pb n="6418" />time this stone has been held in very high esteem at Rome: forwhich reason, we shall give it the next place after the opal.By sardonyx, as the name<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> itself indicates, was formerly understooda sarda with a white ground beneath it, like the fleshbeneath the human finger-nail; both parts of the stone beingequally transparent. Such, according to Ismenias, Demostratus,Zenothemis, and Sotacus, is the sardonyx of India; the lasttwo giving the name of "blind" sardonyx to all the otherstones of this class which are not transparent, and which havenow entirely appropriated the name to themselves. For, atthe present day, the Arabian sardonyx presents no traces whateverof the Indian sarda,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> it being a stone that has been foundto be characterized by several different colours of late; blackor azure for the base, and vermilion, surrounded with a line ofrich white, for the upper part, not without a certain glimpse<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>of purple as the white passes into the red.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span></p><p>We learn from Zenothemis that in his time these stoneswere not held by the people of India in any high esteem, althoughthey are found there of so large a size as to admit ofthe hilts of swords being made of them. It is well known, too,that in that country they are exposed to view by the mountain-streams,and that in our part of the world they were formerlyvalued from the fact that they are nearly the only ones<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> amongthe engraved precious stones that do not bring away the waxwhen an impression is made. The consequence is, that ourexample has at last taught the people of India to set a valueupon them, and the lower classes there now pierce them even,to wear them as ornaments for the neck; the great proof, infact, at the present day, of a sardonyx being of Indian origin.Those of Arabia are remarkable for their marginal line ofbrilliant white, of considerable breadth, and not glistening inhollow fissures in the stone or upon the sides, but shining uponthe very surface, at the margin, and supported by a groundintensely black beneath. In the stones of India, this ground<pb n="6419" />is like wax in colour,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> or else like cornel, with a circle also ofwhite around it. In some of these stones, too, there is a playof colours like those of the rainbow, while the surface is reddereven than the shell of the sea-locust.<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span></p><p>Those stones which are like honey in appearance, or of afæculent<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> colour—such being the name given to one defect inthem—are generally disapproved of. They are rejected alsowhen the white zone blends itself with the other colours, andits limits are not definitely marked; or if, in like manner, it isirregularly intersected by any other colour; it being lookedupon as an imperfection if the regularity of any one of thecolours is interrupted by the interposition of another. Thesardonyx of Armenia is held in some esteem, but the zoneround it is of a pallid hue.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Said ironically.
