<div2 type="chapter" n="49" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 49.—THE SEA BRYON.</head><p>There is another kind of marine shrub, known by the nameof "bryon;"<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> it has the leaf of the lettuce, only that it isof a more wrinkled appearance; it grows nearer land, too, thanthe last. Far out at sea we find a fir-tree<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and an oak,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>each a cubit in height; shells are found adhering to theirbranches. It is said that this sea-oak is used for dyeing wool,and that some of them even bear acorns<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> in the sea, a fact whichhas been ascertained by shipwrecked persons and divers. Thereare other marine trees also of remarkable size, found in thevicinity of Sicyon; the sea-vine,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> indeed, grows everywhere.The sea-fig<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> is destitute of leaves, and the bark is red. There<pb n="3211" />is a palm-tree<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> also in the number of the sea-shrubs. Beyondthe columns of Hercules there is a sea-shrub that grows withthe leaf of the leek, and others with those of the carrot,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> andof thyme. Both of these last, when thrown up by the tide,are transformed <span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> into pumice.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Ulva lactuca of the moderns, a very common sea-weed.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Fucus ericoïdes, Fée suggests, not unlike a fir in appearance.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Quercus. According to Gmellin, this is the Fucus vesiculosus of Linnæus. Its leaves are indented, somewhat similarly to those of the oak.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Polybius, as quoted by Athenæus, says that in the Lusitanian Seathere are oaks that bear acorns, on which the thunnies Feed and grow fat.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">On the contrary, Theophrastus says, B. iv. c. 7, that the sea-vinegrows <hi rend="ital">near</hi> the sea, from which Fée is disposed to consider it a phanerogamous plant. If, on the other hand, it is really a fucus, he thinks that theFucus uvarius may be meant, the vesicles of which resemble a grape inshape.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He speaks of a madrepore, Fée thinks, the identity of which it isdifficult to determine. Professor Pallas speaks of an Alcyonidium ficus,which lives in the Mediterranean and in the ocean, and which resembles afig, and has no leaves, but its exterior is not red.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Feé queries whether this may not be the Gorgonia palma of Linnæus,which has received its name from its resemblance to a small palm-tree.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">These three, Fée thinks, are madrepores or zoophytes, which it wouldbe vain to attempt to identify.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">That is, they dry up to the consistency of pumice.</p></body>
