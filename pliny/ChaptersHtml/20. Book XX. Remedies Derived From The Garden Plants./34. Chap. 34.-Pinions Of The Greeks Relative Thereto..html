<div2 type="chapter" n="34" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 34.—PINIONS OF THE GREEKS RELATIVE THERETO.</head><p>As we have already given those of Cato, it will be as wellto set forth the opinions entertained by the Greek writers onthis subject, only in relation, however, to those points uponwhich he has omitted to touch. They are of opinion thatcabbage, not thoroughly boiled, carries off the bile, and hasthe effect of loosening the bowels; while, on the other hand,if it is boiled twice over, it will act as an astringent. Theysay, too, that as there is a natural<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> enmity between it and thevine, it combats the effects of wine; that, if eaten before drinking, it is sure to prevent<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> drunkenness, being equally a dispellent of crapulence<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> if taken after drinking: that cabbageis a food very beneficial to the eyesight, and that the juice ofit raw is even more so, if the corners of the eyes are onlytouched with a mixture of it with Attic honey. Cabbage, too,<pb n="4238" />according to the same testimony, is extremely easy of digestion,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and, as an aliment, greatly tends to clear the senses.</p><p>The school of Erasistratus proclaims that there is nothingmore beneficial to the stomach and the sinews than cabbage;for which reason, he says, it ought to be given to the paralyticand nervous, as well as to persons affected with spitting ofblood. Hippocrates prescribes it, twice boiled, and eaten withsalt, for dysentery and cœliac affections, as also for tenesmusand diseases of the kidneys; he is of opinion, too, that, asan aliment, it increases the quantity of the milk in womenwho are nursing, and that it promotes the menstrual discharge.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> The stalk, too, eaten raw, is efficacious in expellingthe dead fœtus. Apollodorus prescribes the seed or else thejuice of the cabbage to be taken in cases of poisoning by fungi;and Philistion recommends the juice for persons affected withopisthotony, in goats'-milk, with salt and honey.</p><p>I find, too, that persons have been cured of the gout by eatingcabbage and drinking a decoction of that plant. This decoctionhas been given, also, to persons afflicted with the cardiac diseaseand epilepsy, with the addition of salt; and it has been ad-ministered in white wine, for affections of the spleen, for aperiod of forty days.</p><p>According to Philistion, the juice of the raw root should begiven as a gargle to persons afflicted with icterus<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> or phrenitis,and for hiccup he prescribes a mixture of it, in vinegar, withcoriander, anise, honey, and pepper. Used as a liniment, cabbage, he says, is beneficial for inflations of the stomach; andthe very water, even, in which it has been boiled, mixed withbarley-meal, is a remedy for the stings of serpents<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> and foululcers of long standing; a result which is equally effected bya mixture of cabbage-juice with vinegar or fenugreek. It isin this manner, too, that some persons employ it topically, foraffections of the joints and for gout. Applied topically, cabbage is a cure for epinyetis, and all kinds of spreading eruptionson the body, as also for sudden<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> attacks of dimness; indeed, if<pb n="4239" />eaten with vinegar, it has the effect of curing the last. Applied by itself, it heals contusions and other livid spots; andmixed with a hall of alum in vinegar, it is good as a linimentfor leprosy and itch-scabs: used in this way, too, it preventsthe hair from falling off.</p><p>Epicharmus assures us that, applied topically, cabbage isextremely beneficial for diseases of the testes and genitals, andeven better still when employed with bruised beans; he says,too, that it is a cure for convulsions; that, in combinationwith rue, it is good for the burning heats of fever and maladiesof the stomach; and that, with rue-seed, it brings away theafter-birth. It is of use, also, for the bite of the shrew-mouse.Dried cabbage-leaves, reduced to a powder, are a cathartic bothby vomit and by stool.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This absurd notion of antipathy is carried so far by the author of theGeoponica, B. v. c. 11, that he states that if wine is thrown on cabbagewhile on the fire, it will never be thoroughly boiled.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Fée remarks, that this fact would surely have engaged the attentionof the moderns, if there had been any truth in the statement.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Crapulam discuti."
