Cut into thin layers of veneer, it is veryflexible, but is only used for the construction of boxes anddesks. The wood, too, of the holm-oak is cut into veneersof remarkable thinness, the colour of which is far from unsightly; but it is more particularly where it is exposed tofriction that this wood is valued, as being one to be dependedupon; in the axle-trees of wheels, for instance; for which theash is also employed, on account of its pliancy, the holm-oakfor its hardness, and the elm, for the union in it of boththose qualities. There are also various workman's tools madeof wood, which, though but small, are still remarkably useful;in this respect, it is said that the best materials for makingauger handles are the wild olive, the box, the holm-oak, theelm, and the ash. Of the same woods also mallets are made;the larger ones, however, are made of the pine and the holm-oak. These woods, too, have a greater degree of strength andhardness if cut in season than when hewn prematurely; indeed,it has been known for hinge-jambs, made of olive, a wood ofremarkable hardness, after having remained a considerabletime on the spot, to put out buds<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> like a growing plant. Cato<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>recommends levers to be made of holly, laurel, or elm; andHyginus speaks highly of the yoke-elm, the holm-oak, andthe cerrus, for the handles of agricultural implements.</p><p>The best woods for cutting into layers, and employing as a<pb n="3429" />veneer for covering others, are the citrus, the terebinth, thedifferent varieties of the maple, the box, the palm,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> the holly,the holm-oak, the root of the elder, and the poplar. The alderfurnishes also, as already stated,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> a kind of tuberosity, whichis cut into layers like those of the citrus and the maple. Inall the other trees the tuberosities are of no value whatever.It is the central part of trees that is most variegated, and thenearer we approach to the root the smaller are the spots andthe more wavy. It was in this appearance that originatedthat requirement of luxury which displays itself in coveringone tree with another, and bestowing upon the more commonwoods a bark of higher price. In order to make a singletree sell many times over, laminæ of veneer have been devised; but that was not thought sufficient—the horns of animals must next be stained of different colours, and their teethcut into sections, in order to decorate wood with ivory, and,at a later period, to veneer it all over. Then, after all this, manmust go and seek his materials in the sea as well! For thispurpose he has learned to cut tortoise-shell into sections; andof late, in the reign of Nero, there was a monstrous inventiondevised of destroying its natural appearance by paint, andmaking it sell at a still higher price by a successful imitationof wood.</p><p>It is in this way that the value of our couches is so greatlyenhanced; it is in this way, too, that they bid the rich lustre ofthe terebinth to be outdone, a mock citrus to be made thatshall be more valuable than the real one, and the grain of themaple to be feigned. At one time luxury was not contentwith wood; at the present day it sets us on buying tortoiseshell in the guise of wood.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This could only have happened in the first year that they were soemployed.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">De Re Rust. c. 31.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is singular.
