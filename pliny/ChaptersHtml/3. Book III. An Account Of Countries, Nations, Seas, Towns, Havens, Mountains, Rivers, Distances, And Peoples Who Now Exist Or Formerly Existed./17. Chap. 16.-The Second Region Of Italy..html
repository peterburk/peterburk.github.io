<div2 type="chapter" n="16" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 16.ÑTHE SECOND REGION OF ITALY.</head><p>Adjoining to this district is the second region of Italy, whichembraces the Hirpini, Calabria, Apulia, and the Salentini, extending a distance of 250 miles along the Gulf of Tarentum,which receives its name from a town of the Laconians socalled, situate at the bottom of the Gulf; to which was annexedthe maritime colony which had previously settled there.Tarentum<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> is distant from the promontory of Lacinium 136miles, and throws out the territory of Calabria opposite to itin the form of a peninsula. The Greeks called this territoryMessapia, from their leader<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>; before which it was called Peucetia, from Peucetius<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>, the brother of Înotrius, and wascomprised in the territory of Salentinum. Between thetwo promontories<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> there is a distance of 100 miles. Thebreadth across the peninsula from Tarentum<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> to Brundusiumby land is 35 miles, considerably less if measured from theport of Sasina<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>. The towns inland from Tarentum are Varia<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>surnamed Apulia, Messapia, and Aletium<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>; on the coast,Senum, and Callipolis<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>, now known as Anxa, 75 miles from<pb n="1226" />Tarentum. Thence, at a distance of 32 miles, is the Pro-montory of Acra Iapygia<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>, at which point Italy projectsthe greatest distance into the sea. At a distance of 19 milesfrom this point is the town of Basta<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>, and then Hydruntum<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>,the spot at which the Ionian is separated from the Adriaticsea, and from which the distance across to Greece is theshortest. The town of the Apolloniates<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> lies opposite to it,and the breadth of the arm of the sea which runs between isnot more than fifty miles. Pyrrhus, king of Epirus, was thefirst who entertained the notion of uniting these two pointsand making a passage on foot, by throwing a bridge across,and after him M. Varro<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>, when commanding the fleet ofPompey in the war against the Pirates. Other cares howeverprevented either of them from accomplishing this design.Passing Hydruntum, we come to the deserted site ofSoletum<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>, then Fratuertium, the Portus Tarentinus, thehaven of Miltopa, Lupia<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span>, Balesium<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span>, C¾lia<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span>, and then Brundusium<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span>, fifty miles from Hydruntum. This last place is<pb n="1227" />one of the most famous .ports of Italy, and, although moredistant, affords by far the safest passage across to Greece,the place of disembarkation being Dyrrachium, a city ofIllyria; the distance across is 225 miles.</p><p>Adjoining Brundusium is the territory of the Pediculi<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span>;nine youths and as many maidens, natives of Illyria, becamethe parents of sixteen nations. The towns of the Pediculiare Rudi¾<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span>, Egnatia<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span>, and Barium<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span>; their rivers are the Iapyx(so called from the son of D¾dalus, who was king there, andwho gave it the name of Iapygia), the Pactius<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span>, and theAufidus, which rises in the Hirpinian mountains and flowspast Canusium<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span>.</p><p>At this point begins Apulia, surnamed the Daunian, from theDaunii, who take their name from a former chief, the father-in-law of Diomedes. In this territory are the towns of Salapia<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span>,famous for Hannibal's amour with a courtezan, Sipontum<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span>,<pb n="1228" />Uria, the river Cerbalus<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span>, forming the boundary of the Daunii,the port of Agasus<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span>, and the Promontory of Mount Garganus<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span>, distant from the Promontory of Salentinum or Iapygia234 miles. Making the circuit of Garganus, we come to theport of Garna<span id="ref_31"><a href="#note_31">[31]</a></span>, the Lake Pantanus<span id="ref_32"><a href="#note_32">[32]</a></span>, the river Frento, themouth of which forms a harbour, Teanum of the Apuli<span id="ref_33"><a href="#note_33">[33]</a></span>, andLarinum, Cliternia<span id="ref_34"><a href="#note_34">[34]</a></span>, and the river Tifernus, at which thedistrict of the Frentani<span id="ref_35"><a href="#note_35">[35]</a></span> begins. Thus there were threedifferent nations of the Apulians, [the Daunii,] the Teani, socalled from their leader, and who sprang from the Greeks, andthe Lucani, who were subdued by Calchas<span id="ref_36"><a href="#note_36">[36]</a></span>, and whose countryis now possessed by the Atinates. Besides those already mentioned, there are, of the Daunii, the colonies of Luceria<span id="ref_37"><a href="#note_37">[37]</a></span> andVenusia<span id="ref_38"><a href="#note_38">[38]</a></span>, the towns of Canusium<span id="ref_39"><a href="#note_39">[39]</a></span> and Arpi, formerly calledArgos Hippium<span id="ref_40"><a href="#note_40">[40]</a></span> and founded by Diomedes, afterwards calledArgyrippa. Here too Diomedes destroyed the nations of theMonadi and the Dardi, and the two cities of Apina and<pb n="1229" />Trica<span id="ref_41"><a href="#note_41">[41]</a></span>, whose names have passed into a by-word and aproverb.</p><p>Besides the above, there is in the interior of the secondregion one colony of the Hirpini, Beneventum<span id="ref_42"><a href="#note_42">[42]</a></span>, so called byan exchange of a more auspicious name for its old one ofMaleventum; also the ®culani<span id="ref_43"><a href="#note_43">[43]</a></span>, the Aquilonii<span id="ref_44"><a href="#note_44">[44]</a></span>, the Abellinates surnamed Protropi, the Compsani, the Caudini, theLigures, both those called the Corneliani and Bebiani, theVescellani, the ®clani, the Aletrini, the Abellinates<span id="ref_45"><a href="#note_45">[45]</a></span> surnamed Marsi, the Atrani, the ®cani<span id="ref_46"><a href="#note_46">[46]</a></span>, the Alfellani<span id="ref_47"><a href="#note_47">[47]</a></span>, the<pb n="1230" />Atinates<span id="ref_48"><a href="#note_48">[48]</a></span>, the Arpani, the Borcani, the Collatni, the Cori-nenses, the Cannenses<span id="ref_49"><a href="#note_49">[49]</a></span>, rendered famous by the defeat of theRomans, the Dirini, the Forentani<span id="ref_50"><a href="#note_50">[50]</a></span>, the Genusini<span id="ref_51"><a href="#note_51">[51]</a></span>, the Herdo-nienses, the Hyrini<span id="ref_52"><a href="#note_52">[52]</a></span>, the Larinates surnamed Frentani<span id="ref_53"><a href="#note_53">[53]</a></span>, theMerinates<span id="ref_54"><a href="#note_54">[54]</a></span> of Garganus, the Mateolani, the Netini<span id="ref_55"><a href="#note_55">[55]</a></span>, the Ru-bustini<span id="ref_56"><a href="#note_56">[56]</a></span>, the Silvini<span id="ref_57"><a href="#note_57">[57]</a></span>, the Strapellini<span id="ref_58"><a href="#note_58">[58]</a></span>, the Turmentini, theVibinates<span id="ref_59"><a href="#note_59">[59]</a></span>, the Venusini, and the Ulurtini. In the interiorof Calabria there are the ®getini, the Apamestini<span id="ref_60"><a href="#note_60">[60]</a></span>, theArgentini, the Butuntinenses<span id="ref_61"><a href="#note_61">[61]</a></span>, the Deciani, the Grumbestini,<pb n="1231" />the Norbanenses, the Palionenses, the Sturnini<span id="ref_62"><a href="#note_62">[62]</a></span>, and theTutini: there are also the following Salentine nations; theAletini<span id="ref_63"><a href="#note_63">[63]</a></span>, the Basterbini<span id="ref_64"><a href="#note_64">[64]</a></span>, the Neretini, the Uxentini, andthe Veretini<span id="ref_65"><a href="#note_65">[65]</a></span>.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This word is understood in the text, and Ansart would have it to mean that the "Gulf of Tarentum is distant," &amp;c., but, as he says, such an assertion would be very indefinite, it not being stated what part of the Gulf is meant. He therefore suggests that the most distant point from Lacinium is meant; which however, according to him, would make but 117 miles straight across, and 160 by land. The city of Tarentum would be the most distant point.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Messapus, a Beotian, mentioned by Strabo, B. ix.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A son of Lycaon.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Of Lacinium and Acra Iapygia.

In the sixteenth century considerable remains of Basta were still to be seen.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The modern Otranto stands on its site. In the fourth century it became the usual place of passage from Italy to Greece, Apollonia, and Dyrrhachium. Few vestiges of the ancient city are now to be seen.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Anciently Apollonia, in Illyria, now called Pallina or Pollona.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This was M.

His design, here mentioned, seems however to have evinced neither learning nor discretion.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called Soleto. The ruins of the ancient city, described by Galateo as existing at Muro, are not improbably those of Fratuertium, or, perhaps more rightly, Fratuentum.</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The modern Lecce is supposed to occupy its site.</p><p><span id="note_17"><a href="#ref_17">17. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Called Valetium by Mela.

The site is still called Baleso or Valesio.</p><p><span id="note_18"><a href="#ref_18">18. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ansart takes this to be the modern village of Cavallo, on the promontory of that name; but it is more probably the modern Ceglie, situate on a hill about twelve miles from the Adriatic, and twenty-seven miles west of Brindisi. Extensive ruins still exist there. There was another town of the same name in the south of Apulia.</p><p><span id="note_19"><a href="#ref_19">19. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Brindisi. Virgil died here. The modern city, which is an impoverished place, presents but few vestiges of antiquity.

It was probably the last town of the Peucetians towards the frontiers of Calabria. Horace, in the account of his journey to Brundusium (I. Sat. i. 97Ð100), makes it his last halting-place, and ridicules a pretended miracle shown by the inhabitants, who asserted that incense placed on a certain altar was consumed without fire being applied. The same story is referred to by Pliny, B. ii. c. 111, where he incorrectly makes Egnatia a town of the Salentini. Its ruins are visible on the sea-coast, about six miles S.E. of Monopali, and an old town still bears the name of Torre d'Agnazzo.</p><p><span id="note_23"><a href="#ref_23">23. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Bari, a considerable city. In the time of Horace it was only a fishing town. It probably had a considerable intercourse with Greece, if we may judge from the remains of art found here.</p><p><span id="note_24"><a href="#ref_24">24. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is difficult to identify these rivers, from the number of small torrents between Brindisi and the Ofanto or Aufidus. According to Mannert, the Pactius is the present Canale di Terzo.</p><p><span id="note_25"><a href="#ref_25">25. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">An important city of Apulia, said to have been founded by Diomedes. Horace alludes to its deficiency of water. The modern Canosa is built on probably the site of the citadel of the ancient city, the ruins of which are very extensive.</p><p><span id="note_26"><a href="#ref_26">26. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The ruins of this place are still to be seen at some little distance from the coast, near the village of Salpi. The story about Hannibal was very probably of Roman invention, for Justin .and Frontinus speak in praise of his continence and temperance. Appian however gives some further particulars of this alleged amour.</p><p><span id="note_27"><a href="#ref_27">27. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The present Manfredonia has arisen from the decay of this town, in consequence of the unhealthiness of the locality. Ancient Uria is supposed to have occupied the site of Manfredonia, and the village of Santa Maria di Siponto stands where Siponti stood.</p><p><span id="note_28"><a href="#ref_28">28. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably the Cervaro. Hardouin says the Candelaro.</p><p><span id="note_29"><a href="#ref_29">29. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The present Porto Greco occupies its site.</p><p><span id="note_30"><a href="#ref_30">30. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Still known as Gargano.</p><p><span id="note_31"><a href="#ref_31">31. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably the present Varano.</p><p><span id="note_32"><a href="#ref_32">32. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Lago di Lesina.

Here answers were given in dreams, for those who consulted the oracle had to sacrifice a black ram, and slept a night in the temple, lying on the skin of the victim.</p><p><span id="note_37"><a href="#ref_37">37. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The modern Lucera in the Capitanata.</p><p><span id="note_38"><a href="#ref_38">38. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The birth-place of Horace; now Verosa in the Basilicata.</p><p><span id="note_39"><a href="#ref_39">39. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The modern Canosa stands on the site of the citadel of ancient Canusium, an Apulian city of great importance. The remains of the ancient city are very considerable.</p><p><span id="note_40"><a href="#ref_40">40. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">So called, it was said, in remembrance of Argos, the native city of Diomedes. It was an Apulian city of considerable importance. Some slight traces of it are still to be seen at a spot which retains the name of Arpa, five miles from the city of Foggia.</p><p><span id="note_41"><a href="#ref_41">41. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The names of these two defunct cities were used by the Romans to signify anything frivolous and unsubstantial; just as we speak of "castles in the air," which the French call "chataux en Espagne."</p><p><span id="note_42"><a href="#ref_42">42. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Livy and Ptolemy assign this place to Samnium Proper, as distinguished from the Hirpini. It was a very ancient city of the Sanmites, but in the year B.C. <date value="-268" authname="-268">268</date>, a Roman colony was settled there, on which occasion, prompted by superstitious feelings, the Romans changed its name Maleventum, which in their language would mean "badly come," to Beneventun or "well come." The modern city of Benevento still retains numerous traces of its ancient grandeur, among others a triumphal arch, erected A.D. <date value="114" authname="114">114</date> in honour of the emperor Trajan.</p><p><span id="note_43"><a href="#ref_43">43. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The remains of ®culanum are to be seen at Le Grotte, one mile from Mirabella. The ruins are very extensive.</p><p><span id="note_44"><a href="#ref_44">44. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There were probably two places called Aquilonia in Italy; the remains of the present one are those probably to be seen at La Cedogna. That mentioned by Livy, B. x. c. 38Ð43, was probably a different place.</p><p><span id="note_45"><a href="#ref_45">45. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">These are supposed by some to be the people of Abellinum mentioned in the first region of Italy. Nothing however is known of these or of the Abellinates Marsi, mentioned below.</p><p><span id="note_46"><a href="#ref_46">46. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">AEc¾ is supposed to have been situate about nineteen miles from Herdonia, and to have been on the site of the modern city of Troja, an episcopal see. The Compsani were the people of Compsa, the modern Conza; and the Caudini were the inhabitants of Caudium, near which were the Fauces Caudin¾ or "Caudine Forks," where the Roman army was captured by the Samnites. The site of this city was probably between the modern Arpaja and Monte Sarchio; and the defeat is thought to have taken place in the narrow valley between Santa Agata and Moirano, on the road from the former place to Benevento, and traversed by the little river Iselero. The enumeration here beginning with the ®clani is thought by Hardouin to be of nations belonging to Apulia, and not to the Hirpini. The ®clani, here mentioned, were probably the people of the place now called Ascoli di Satriano, not far from the river Carapella. Of the Aletrini and Atrani nothing appears to be known.</p><p><span id="note_47"><a href="#ref_47">47. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably the people of Afiil¾, still called Affile, and seven miles from Subiaco.

Its site is ascertained by the ruins near the village of Atena, five miles north of La Sala. Collatia was situate on the Anio, now called the Teverone.</p><p><span id="note_49"><a href="#ref_49">49. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The ruins of the town of Canu¾ are still visible at a place called Canne, about eight miles from Canosa. The Romans were defeated by Hannibal, on the banks of the Aufidus in its vicinity, but there is considerable question as to the exact locality. The ruins of the town are still considerable.</p><p><span id="note_50"><a href="#ref_50">50. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Forentum was the site of the present Forenza in the Basilicate. It is called by Horace and Diodorus Siculus, Ferentum. The ancient town probably stood on a plain below the modern one. Some remains of it are still to be seen.</p><p><span id="note_51"><a href="#ref_51">51. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">On the site of Genusium stands the modern Ginosa. The ruins of the ancient city of Herdonea are still to be seen in the vicinity of the modern Ordona, on the high road from Naples to Otranto.
