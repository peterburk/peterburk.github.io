Lying with the head upwards, it rises to the surfaceof the water, raising itself little by little, while, by means ofa certain conduit in its body, it discharges all the water, andthis being got rid of like so much bilge-water as it were, itfinds no difficulty in sailing along. Then, extending backwards its two front arms, it stretches out between them amembrane<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> of marvellous thinness, which acts as a sailspread out to the wind, while with the rest of its arms itpaddles along below, steering itself with its tail in the middle,which acts as a rudder. Thus does it make its way along thedeep, mimicking the appearance of a light Liburnian<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> bark;while, if anything chances to cause it alarm, in an instant itdraws in the water, and sinks to the bottom.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This account of the nautilus, Cuvier says, the Argonauta argo ofLinnæus, wonderful as it may appear, has been often confirmed by modernobservation.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This, Cuvier says, is not a membrane between the two feet or tentacles, but a distinct membranous delatation of the extremity of each of thosetwo organs.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">These vessels have been already remarked upon in Note 33 to c. 5 ofthe present Book.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle, Hist.
