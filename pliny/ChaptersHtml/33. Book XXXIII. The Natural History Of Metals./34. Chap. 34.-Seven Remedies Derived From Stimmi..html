<div2 type="chapter" n="34" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 34.ÑSEVEN REMEDIES DERIVED FROM STIMMI.</head><p>Stimmi is possessed of certain astringent and refrigerativeproperties, its principal use, in medicine, being for the eyes.Hence it is that most persons call it "platyophthalmon,"<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> it beingextensively employed in the calliblepharie<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> preparations offemales, for the purpose of dilating the eyes. It acts also as acheck upon fluxes of the eyes and ulcerations of those organs;being used, as a powder, with pounded frankincense and gum.It has the property, too, of arresting discharges of blood from<pb n="6116" />the brain; and, sprinkled in the form of a powder, it is extremelyefficacious for the cure of recent wounds and bites of dogs whichhave been some time inflicted. For the cure of burns it is remarkablygood, mixed with grease, litharge,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> ceruse, and wax.</p><p>The method of preparing it, is to burn it, enclosed in acoat of cow-dung, in a furnace; which done, it is quenchedwith woman's milk, and pounded with rain-water in a mortar.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>While this is doing, the thick and turbid part is poured offfrom time to time into a copper vessel, and purified with nitre.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>The lees of it, which are rejected, are recognized by theirbeing full of lead and falling to the bottom. The vessel intowhich the turbid part has been poured off, is then coveredwith a linen cloth and left untouched for a night; the portionthat lies upon the surface being poured off the following day,or else removed with a sponge. The part that has fallen tothe bottom of the vessel is regarded as the choicest<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> part, andis left, covered with a linen cloth, to dry in the sun, but notto become parched. This done, it is again pounded in amortar, and then divided into tablets. But the main thing ofall is, to observe such a degree of nicety in heating it, as notto let it become lead.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> Some persons, when preparing it onthe fire, use grease<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> instead of dung. Others, again, bruise itin water and then pass it through a triple strainer of linencloth; after which, they reject the lees, and pour off theremainder of the liquid, collecting all that is deposited at thebottom, and using it as an ingredient in plasters and eye-salves.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Eye dilating." Belladonna, a preparation from the Atropa belladonna,is now used in medicine for this purpose. A similar effect is attributedin B. xxv. c. 92, to the plant Anagallis. In reality, the applicationof prepared antimony would contract the eyelids, and so <hi rend="ital">appear</hi> to enlargethe eyes. This property is peculiar, Ajasson remarks, to sulphuret of antimony,and sulphuret of antimony and silver.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Preparations "for beautifying the eyebrows." See B. xxi. c. 73, B.xxiii. c. 51, and B. xxxv. c. 56. Omphale, the Lydian queen, who captivatedHercules, is represented by the tragic poet Ion, as using "stimmi"for the purposes of the toilet. It was probably with a preparation of antimonythat Jezebel "painted her face, and tired her head." 2 Kings, ix. 30.The "Kohl" used by the females in Egypt and Persia is prepared from antimony.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Spuma argenti."
