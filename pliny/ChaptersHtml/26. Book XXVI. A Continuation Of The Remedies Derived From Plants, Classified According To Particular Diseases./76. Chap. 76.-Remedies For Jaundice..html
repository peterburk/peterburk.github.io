Hippocrates<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> tells us that the appearance of jaundiceon or after the seventh day in fevers is a fatal symptom; butI am acquainted with some instances in which the patientssurvived after having been reduced to this apparently hopelessstate. We may remark also, that jaundice sometimes comeson without fever supervening. It is combated by taking thegreater centaury,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> as already mentioned, in drink; agaric, indoses of three oboli in old wine; or leaves of vervain, in dosesof three oboli, taken for four consecutive days in one hemina ofmulled wine. But the most speedy cure of all is effected byusing juice of cinquefoil, in doses of three cyathi, with saltand honey. Root of cyclaminos<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> is also taken in drink indoses of three drachmæ, the patient sitting in a warm roomfree from all cold and draughts, the infusion expelling thebile by its action as a sudorific.<pb n="5201" /></p><p>Leaves of tussilago<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> are also used in water for this purpose;the seed of either kind of linozostis,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> sprinkled in the drink, ormade into a decoction with chick-pease or wormwood: hyssopberries taken in water; the plant lichen,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> all other vegetables being carefully abstained from while it is being used;polythrix,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> taken in wine; and struthion,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> in honied wine.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. iv. cc. 62, 64.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxv. c. 30.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxv. c. 67.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or Bechion.
