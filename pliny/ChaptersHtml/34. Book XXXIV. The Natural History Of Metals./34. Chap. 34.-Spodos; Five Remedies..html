It is formed by fusing<pb n="6203" />cadmia with copper ore. This substance, which is the lightestpart of the metal disengaged by fusion, escapes from the furnace,and adheres to the roof, being distinguished from thesoot by the whiteness of its colour. Such parts of it as areless white are indicative of incomplete combustion, and it is thiswhich some persons call "pompholyx." Such portions of it asare of a more reddish colour are possessed of a more energeticpower, and are found to be so corrosive, that if it touchesthe eyes, while being washed, it will cause blindness. Thereis also a spodos of a honey colour, an indication that it containsa large proportion of copper. All the different kinds,however, are improved by washing; it being first skimmed witha feather,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and afterwards submitted to a more substantialwashing, the harder grains being removed with the finger. That,too, which has been washed with wine is more modified in itseffects; there being also some difference according to the kind ofwine that is used. When it has been washed with weak winethe spodos is considered not so beneficial as an ingredient inmedicaments for the eyes; but the same kind of preparation ismore efficacious for running sores, and for ulcers of the mouthattended with a discharge of matter, as well as in all thoseremedies which are used for gangrene.</p><p>There is also a kind of spodos, called "lauriotis,"<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> whichis made in the furnaces where silver is smelted. The kind,however, that is best for the eyes, it is said, is that produced inthe furnaces for smelting gold. Indeed there is no departmentof art in which the ingenuity of man is more to be admired;for it has discovered among the very commonest objects, asubstance that is in every way possessed of similar properties.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A Greek word, signifying "ashes," or the residuum after combustion.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From the corresponding passage in Dioscorides, there is some doubtwhether the account of this process here given is correct.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">So called from Laurium, a district in Attica, in which there were silvermines.
