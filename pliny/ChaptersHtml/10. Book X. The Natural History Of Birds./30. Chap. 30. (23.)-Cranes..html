(23.)â€”CRANES.</head><p>By the departure of the cranes, which, as we have alreadystated,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> were in the habit of waging war with them, the nationof the Pygmies now enjoys a respite. The tracts over whichthey travel must be immense, if we only consider that theycome all the way from the Eastern Sea.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> These birds agree bycommon consent at what moment they shall set out, fly aloftto look out afar, select a leader for them to follow, and havesentinels duly posted in the rear, which relieve each other byturns, utter loud cries, and with their voice keep the wholeflight in proper array. During the night, also, they place sentinels on guard, each of which holds a little stone in its claw: ifthe bird should happen to fall asleep, the claw becomes relaxed,and the stone falls to the ground, and so convicts it of neglect.The rest sleep in the meanwhile, with the head beneath thewing, standing first on one leg and then on the other: theleader looks out, with neck erect, and gives warning whenrequired. These birds, when tamed, are very frolicsome, andeven when alone will describe a sort of circle, as they movealong, with their clumsy gait.</p><p>It is a well-known fact, that these birds, when about to flyover the Euxine, first of all repair to the narrowest part of it,that lies between the two<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> Promontories of Criumetopon andCarambis, and then ballast themselves with coarse sand. Whenthey have arrived midway in the passage, they throw away thestones from out of their claws, and, as soon as they reach themainland, discharge the sand by the throat.</p><p>Cornelius Nepos, who died in the reign of the late EmperorAugustus, after stating that thrushes had been fattened for thefirst time shortly before that period, has added that storks weremore esteemed as food than cranes: whereas at the presentday, this last bird is one of those that are held in the veryhighest esteem, while no one will so much as touch the other.<pb n="2502" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">B. iv. c. 18, and B. vii. c. 2.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. vii. c. 2, Pliny speaks of the Pygmies as living to the far Eastof India.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. iv. cc. 20 and 26; and B. vi. c. 2.</p></body>
