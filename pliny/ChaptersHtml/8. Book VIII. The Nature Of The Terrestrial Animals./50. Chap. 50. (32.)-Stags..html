<div2 type="chapter" n="50" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 50. (32.)—STAGS.</head><p>Stags, although the most mild of all animals, have still theirown feelings of malignancy;<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> when hard pressed by thehounds, of their own accord they fly for refuge to man; andwhen the females bring forth, they are less anxious to avoidthe paths which bear traces of human footsteps, than solitaryspots which offer a retreat to wild beasts.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> They becomepregnant after the rising of the constellation Arcturus;<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> theybring forth after a gestation of eight months, and sometimesproduce two young ones. They separate after conception, butthe males, upon being thus abandoned, become maddened withthe fury of their passion; they dig up the earth, and theirmuzzles become quite black, until they have been washed bythe rain.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> The females, before they bring forth, purge themselves by means of a certain herb, which is called seselis, bythe use of which parturition is rendered more easy. After delivery, they take a mixture of the two plants called seselis<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> andaros,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> and then return to the fawn; they seem desirous, for<pb n="2300" />some reason or other, that their first milk, after parturition,should be impregnated with the juice of these plants. Theythen exercise the young ones in running, and teach them howto take to flight, leading them to precipices, and showing themhow to leap. The sexual passion of the male having been nowsatisfied, he repairs to the pasture lands with the greatest eagerness. When they feel themselves becoming too fat, they seeksome retired spot, thus acknowledging the inconvenience arisingfrom their bulk. Besides this, they continually pause in theirflight, stand still and look back, and then again resume theirflight when the enemy approaches. This pause is occasionedby the intense pain which they feel in the intestines, a partwhich is so weak, that a very slight blow will cause them tobreak within. The barking of a dog instantly puts them toflight, and they always run with the wind, in order that notrace of them may be left. They are soothed by the shepherd's pipe and his song;<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> when their ears are erect, theirsense of hearing is very acute, but when dropped, they becomedeaf.<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>In other respects the stag is a simple animal, which regardsevery thing as wonderful, and with a stupid astonishment; somuch so, indeed, that if a horse or cow happens to approachit, it will not see the hunter, who may be close at hand, or, ifit does see him, it only gazes upon his bow and arrow. Stagscross the sea in herds, swimming in a long line, the headof each resting on the haunches of the one that precedes it,each in its turn falling back to the rear. This has been particularly remarked when they pass over from Cilicia to theisland of Cyprus. Though they do not see the land, they stillare able to direct themselves by the smell. The males havehorns, and are the only animals that shed them every year, ata stated time in the spring; at which period they seek outwith the greatest care the most retired places, and afterlosing them, remain concealed, as though aware that they<pb n="2301" />are unarmed. Still, however, they envy us the good that thesemight do us; for it is said the right horn, which possesses, as itwere, certain medicinal properties, can never be found, a circumstance the more astonishing, from the fact that they change theirhorns every year, even when kept in parks;<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> it is generallythought that they bury their horns in the ground. The odourof either horn, when burnt, drives away serpents and detectsepilepsy. They also bear the marks of their age on the horns,every year, up to the sixth,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> a fresh antler being added; afterwhich period the horns are renewed in the same state, so thatby means of them their age cannot be ascertained. Their oldage, however, is indicated by their teeth, for then they haveonly a few, or none at all; and we then no longer perceive, atthe base of their horns, antlers projecting from the front of theforehead, as is usually the case with the animal when young.</p><p>When this animal is castrated it does not shed its horns, norare they reproduced. When the horns begin to be reproduced,two projections are to be seen, much resembling, at first, dryskin; they grow with tender shoots, having upon them a softdown like that on the head of a reed. So long as they arewithout horns, they go to feed during the night. As thehorns grow, they harden by the heat of the sun, and theanimal, from time to time, tries their strength upon the trees;when satisfied with their strength, it leaves its retreat.</p><p>Stags, too, have been occasionally caught with ivy greenand growing on their horns,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> the plant having taken rooton them, as it would on any piece of wood, while the animalwas rubbing them against the trees. The stag is sometimesfound white, as is said to have been the case with the hindof Q. Sertorius, which he persuaded the nations of Spain tolook upon as having the gift of prophecy.<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> The stag, too,<pb n="2302" />fights with the serpent: it traces out the serpent's hole, anddraws it forth by the breath of its lostrils,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> and hence it isthat the smell of burnt stags' horn has the remarkable powerof driving away serpents. The very best remedy for the biteof a serpent is the rennet of a fawn that has been killed in thewomb of its mother.</p><p>The stag is generally admitted to be very long lived; somewere captured at the end of one hundred years with the goldencollars which Alexander the Great had put upon them, andwhich were quite concealed by the folds of the skin, in consequence of the accumulation of fat.<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> This animal is not subject to fever, and, indeed, it is a preservative against that complaint. We know that of late some women of princely rankhave been in the habit of eating the flesh of the stag everymorning, and that they have arrived at an extreme old age,free from all fevers. It is, however, generally supposed thatthe animal must be killed by a single wound to make sure ofit possessing this virtue.</p><p>(33.) Of the same species is an animal, which only differsfrom the stag in having a beard and long hair about theshoulders: it is called tragelaphus,<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> and is produced nowhereexcept on the banks of the Phasis.<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This refers to what will be found stated in this Chapter, that stagsconceal their horns, when they fall off, that they may not be used in medicine.—B.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is mentioned by Aristotle, Plutarch, and Ælian, but it must beconsidered as very doubtful.—B.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xviii. c. 74.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It seems that Pliny here attributes the blackening of the mouths ofthe stags to their turning up the earth with their muzzles; Aristotle, however, refers it to a constitutional cause, arising from their violent sexualexcitement; Hist. Anim. B. vi. c. 29.—B.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or seseli, probably hart-wort. See B. xx. c. 87, and B. xxv. c. 52.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We learn from Hardouin, that there has been much discussion respecting the plants or other substances which the female is supposed to eatafter parturition. Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. ix. c. 6, asserts that it eatsthe chorion, the membrane in which the fœtus has been enveloped, andafterwards the herb seselis. To make the account of Pliny agree withthat of Aristotle, some of the commentators have even supposed, that<hi rend="ital">chorion</hi> here means the name of a plant, and they have proposed to substitute the word <hi rend="ital">chorion</hi> for <hi rend="ital">aros</hi> in the text.—B. Aros is probably thepresent "Arum maculatum," or wake-robin. See p. 307, N. 78.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle, Plutarch, and Xenophon speak of the influence of music onthese animals.—B.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle, <hi rend="ital">ubi supra,</hi> mentions this respecting their ears; the sametakes place, to a certain extent, with all animals that have large externalauricles.—B.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle, <hi rend="ital">ubi supra,</hi> Ælian, <hi rend="ital">ubi supra,</hi> and B. iii. c. 17, and Theophrastus, in a fragment on the Envious among Animals, agree in statingthat one of the horns of the stag is never found, although they differ respecting the individual horn, whether the right one or the left. Aristotlesays that it is the left, while Theophrastus and Ælian agree with the statement of Pliny.—B.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier says, that no antlers are added after the eighth year.—B.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This, as well as most of the statements respecting the growth of thehorns, is mentioned by Aristotle, <hi rend="ital">ubi supra,</hi> but it is quite unfounded.—B.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This story of the white hind of Sertorius, is given in detail by AulusGellius, B. xv. c. 22, who tells us that it was given to him by a native ofLusitania, upon which Sertorius pretended that it had been sent from Diana, who, through it, held converse with him, and instructed him howto act. Plutarch, Frontinus, and Valerius Maximus, also relate the story.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This story, which is obviously incorrect, is mentioned by Ælian,Anim. Nat. B. ii. c. 9; and is again referred to in B. xxviii. c. 42.—B.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Graguinus, Hist. Franc. B. ix. c. 3, relates a still more wonderfulanecdote of a similar nature; but, as Buffon remarks, such tales are without foundation, the life of the stag not being more than thirty or fortyyears. Cuvier, also, says that its life does not exceed thirty-six or fortyyears.—B.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The real nature of the tragelaphus of Pliny, and the hippelaphus,or horse-stag of Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. ii. c. 1, which appear to be thesame animal, had long remained a disputed question among naturalists,when, as Cuvier states, the point was decided by Alphonse Duvaucel, whoascertained that it was a species of stag, which inhabited the mountains ofthe north of Hindostan.—B.</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">And in Arabia as well, according to Diodorus Siculus, B. ii.</p></body>
