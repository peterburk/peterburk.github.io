<div2 type="chapter" n="68" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 68. (45.)ÑTHE ASS, ITS GENERATION.</head><p>M. Varro informs us that Quintus Axius, the senator, paidfor an ass the sum of four hundred thousand sesterces;<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> I am<pb n="2323" />not sure whether this did not exceed the price ever givenfor any other animal. It is certainly a species of animal singularly useful for labour and ploughing,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> but more especiallyfor the production of mules.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> In these animals also, thecountry in which they are born is taken into consideration;in Greece, those from Arcadia<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> are the most valued; and inItaly, those of Reate.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> The ass is an animal which is unableto endure cold,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> for which reason it is that it is never producedin Pontus; nor is it allowed to cover at the vernal equinox, likeother cattle, but at the summer solstice. The males are lessproper for covering, when out of work. The earliest age atwhich the females are ever capable of bearing is the thirtiethmonth, but the usual time begins at the age of three years.The number to which it gives birth is the same as the mare,which it also resembles, in the length of its gestation, and inits mode of bringing forth; but the female will discharge thegenerative fluid from the womb, being unable to retain it,unless by blows she is forced to run immediately afterbeing covered. They seldom bring forth two at one birth.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>When the she-ass is about to bring forth, she shuns thelight and seeks darkness, in order to escape the observationof man. Asses are capable of breeding throughout thewhole of their life, which extends to thirty years. Theirattachment to their young is great in the extreme, but theiraversion to water is still greater. They will pass through fire toget at their foals, while the very same animal, if the small-<pb n="2324" />est stream intervenes, will tremble, and not dare so much asto wet even its feet. Nor yet in their pastures will theyever drink at any but the usual watering-place, and they makeit their care to find some dry path by which to get at it.They will not pass over a bridge either, when the water can beseen between the planks beneath.<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> Wonderful to relate, too,if their watering-places are changed, though they should beever so thirsty, they will not drink without being either beatenor caressed. They ought always to have plenty of room forsleeping; for they are very subject to various diseases in theirsleep, when they repeatedly throw out their feet, and wouldimmediately lame themselves by coming in contact with anyhard substance; so that it is necessary that they should beprovided with an empty space. The profit which is derivedfrom these animals exceeds that arising from the richest estate.It is a well-known fact, that in Celtiberia there are some sheasses which have produced to their owners as much as four hundred thousand sesterces.<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> In the rearing of she-mules it is saidto be particularly necessary to attend to the colour of the hairof the ears and the eyelids, for, although the rest of the bodybe all of one colour, the mule that is produced will have all thecolours that are found in those parts. M¾cenas was the firstperson who had the young of the ass served up at his table;<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>they were in those times much preferred to the onager or wildass;<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> but, since his time, the taste has gone out of fashion.An ass, after witnessing the death of another ass, survives itbut a very short time only.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There is considerable difficulty in ascertaining the exact amount of sums of money mentioned by the ancients. We read in Varro, B. ii. c. 1,and B. ii. c. 8, of enormous prices said to have been given for asses, andthe particular case of Axius is mentioned, B. iii. c. 2; according to theusual estimate, the sum here mentioned amounts to upwards of £3200sterling,ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xvii. c. 5.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Varro, B. i. c. 20, and B. iii. c. 16, and Columella, B. vii. c. 1, enlarge upon the valuable qualities of the ass for agricultural purposes; Columella, B. vi. c. 37, treats at length upon the production of mules.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See a passage in Plautus, in which the superior excellence of the assesof Arcadia is referred to; Asinaria, A. ii. sc. 2, 1. 67.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. iii. c. 17.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This property is mentioned by Herodotus, B. iv. c. 28, and by Aristotle,Hist.
