<div2 type="chapter" n="99" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 99. (97)—CONCERNING THE CAUSE OF THE FLOWINGAND EBBING OF THE SEA.</head><p>Much has been said about the nature of waters; but themost wonderful circumstance is the alternate flowing andebbing of the tides, which exists, indeed, under various forms,but is caused by the sun and the moon. The tide flowstwice and ebbs twice between each two risings of the moon,<pb n="1125" />always in the space of twenty-four hours. First, the moonrising with the stars<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> swells out the tide, and after some time,having gained the summit of the heavens, she declines fromthe meridian and sets, and the tide subsides. Again, after shehas set, and moves in the heavens under the earth, as sheapproaches the meridian on the opposite side, the tide flowsin; after which it recedes until she again rises to us. Butthe tide of the next day is never at the same time with that ofthe preceding; as if the planet was in attendance<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>, greedilydrinking up the sea, and continually rising in a different placefrom what she did the day before. The intervals are, however,equal, being always of six hours; not indeed in respect of anyparticular day or night or place<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>, but equinoctial hours, andtherefore they are unequal as estimated by the length of commonhours, since a greater number of them<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> fall on some certain days ornights, and they are never equal everywhereexcept at the equinox. This is a great, most clear, and evendivine proof of the dullness of those, who deny that the starsgo below the earth and rise up again, and that nature presents the same face in the same states of their rising andsetting<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>; for the course of the stars is equally obvious in theone case as in the other, producing the same effect as whenit is manifest to the sight.</p><p>There is a difference in the tides, depending on the moon,of a complicated nature, and, first, as to the period of sevendays. For the tides are of moderate height from the newmoon to the first quarter; from this time they increase, andare the highest at the full: they then decrease. On theseventh day they are equal to what they were at the first<pb n="1126" />quarter, and they again increase from the time that she is atfirst quarter on the other side. At her conjunction withthe sun they are equally high as at the full. When themoon is in the northern hemisphere, and recedes furtherfrom the earth, the tides are lower than when, going towardsthe south, she exercises her influence at a less distance<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>.After an interval of eight years, and the hundredth revolution of the moon, the periods and the heights of the tidesreturn into the same order as at first, this planet alwaysacting upon them; and all these effects are likewise increased by theannual changes of the sun<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>, the tides risingup higher at the equinoxes, and more so at the autumnalthan at the vernal; while they are lower<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> about the wintersolstice, and still more so at the summer solstice; notindeed precisely at the points of time which I have mentioned, but afew days after<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>; for example, not exactly atthe full nor at the new moon, but after them; and notimmediately when the moon becomes visible or invisible, orhas advanced to the middle of her course, but generallyabout two hours later than the equinoctial hours<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>; the effectof what is going on in the heavens being felt after a shortinterval; as we observe with respect to lightning, thunder,and thunderbolts.</p><p>But the tides of the ocean cover greater spaces and producegreater inundations than the tides of the other seas; whetherit be that the whole of the universe taken together is morefull of life than its individual parts, or that the large openspace feels more sensibly the power of the planet, as it movesfreely about, than when restrained within narrow bounds.<pb n="1127" />On which account neither lakes nor rivers are moved in thesame manner. Pytheas<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> of Massilia informs us, that inBritain the tide rises 80 cubits<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>. Inland seas are enclosedas in a harbour, but, in some parts of them, there is a morefree space which obeys the influence<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>. Among many otherexamples, the force of the tide will carry us in three daysfrom Italy to Utica, when the sea is tranquil and there is noimpulse from the sails<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>. But these motions are more feltabout the shores than in the deep parts of the seas, as in thebody the extremities of the veins feel the pulse, which is thevital spirit, more than the other parts<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>. And in most estuaries, on account of the unequal rising of the stars in eachtract, the tides differ from each other, but this respects theperiod, not the nature of them; as is the case in the Syrtes.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Mundo;" the heavens or visible firmament, to which the stars andplanets appear to be connected, so as to be moved along with it.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Ancillante; ""Credas ancillari sidus, et indulgere mari, ut non abeadem parte, qua pridie, pastum ex oceano hauriat."
