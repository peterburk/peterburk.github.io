<div2 type="chapter" n="15" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 15.ÑTHE CALTHA. THE SCOPA REGIA.</head><p>Next to it comes the caltha, the flowers of which are ofsimilar colour and size;<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> in the number of its petals, however,it surpasses the marine violet, the petals of which are nevermore than five in number. The marine violet is surpassed,too, by the other in smell; that of the caltha being very powerful. The smell, too, is no less powerful in the plant known asthe "scopa regia;"<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> but there it is the leaves of the plant,and not the flowers, that are odoriferous.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Concolori amplitudine." Gronovius, with considerable justice, expresses himself at a loss as to the exact meaning of these words. IfSprengel and Salmasius are right in their conjectures that the Caltha ofPliny and Virgil is the marigold, our Calendula officinalis, the passagecannot mean that the flower of it is of the same size and colour withany variety of the violet mentioned in the preceding Chapter. From thedescription given of it by Dioscorides, it is more then probable that theCaltha of the ancients is not the marigold, and Hardouin is probablyright in his conjecture that Pliny intends to describe a variety of the violetunder the name. FŽe is at a loss as to its identification.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "royal broom." Sprengel thinks that this is the Chenopodiumscoparia, a plant common in Greece and Italy; and FŽe is inclined tocoincide with that opinion, though, as he says, there are numerous otherplants with odoriferous leaves and pliant shoots, as its name, broom, wouldseem to imply. Other writers would identify it with a Sideritis, andothers, again with an Achill¾a.</p></body>
