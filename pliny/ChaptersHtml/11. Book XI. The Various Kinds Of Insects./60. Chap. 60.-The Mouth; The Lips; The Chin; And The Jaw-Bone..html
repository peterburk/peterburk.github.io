All animals that are viviparoushave a mouth that is either well-formed, or harshly defined,as the case may be. Instead of lips and mouth, the birdshave a beak that is horny and sharp at the end. With birdsthat live by rapine, the beak is hooked inwards, but with thosewhich gather and peck only, it is straight: those animals,again, which root up grass or puddle in the mud, have themuzzle broad, like swine. The beasts of burden employ themouth in place of hands in gathering their food, while thosewhich live by rapine and slaughter have it wider than therest. No animal, with the exception of man, has either chinor cheek-bones. The crocodile is the only animal that has theupper jaw-bone<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> moveable; among the land quadrupeds it isthe same as with other animals, except that they can move itobliquely.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A Roman family-the reading of this word seems doubtful.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In reality, the under one only.</p></body>
