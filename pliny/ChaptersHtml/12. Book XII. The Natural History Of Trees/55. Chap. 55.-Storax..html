<div2 type="chapter" n="55" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 55.—STORAX.</head><p>That part of Syria joining up to Judæa, and lying abovePhœnicia, produces storax, which is found in the vicinity ofGabala and Marathus,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> as also of Casius, a mountain of Seleucia. The tree<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> bears the same name, and has a strongresemblance to, the quince. The tear has a harsh taste, with apleasant smell; in the interior it has all the appearance of a reed,and is filled with a liquid juice. About the rising of the Dog-star, certain small winged worms hover about this substanceand eat it away, for which reason it is often found in a rottenstate, with worm-holes full of dust. The storax next in esti-mation after that already mentioned, comes from Pisidia,Sidon, Cyprus, and Cilicia; that of Crete being considered thevery worst of all. That which comes from Mount Amanus,in Syria, is highly esteemed for medicinal purposes, and evenmore so by the perfumers. From whatever country it comes,that which is of a red colour is preferred, and it should beboth unctuous as well as viscous to the touch; the worst kindis that which crumbles like bran, and is covered all over witha whitish mould. This substance is adulterated with the resinof cedar or with gum, and sometimes with honey or bitter al-<pb n="3152" />monds; all which sophistications may, however, be detected bythe taste. The price of storax of the best quality is seventeendenarii per pound. It comes also from Pamphylia, but thislast is more arid, and not so full of juice.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">These localities are mentioned in B. v.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Storax officinalis of Linnæus, a tree found in the south ofEurope and the Levant. The variety found in France, and known as theAliboufier, produces no storax, or at least a very small proportion. Thestorax of commerce appears in three states—grain storax, with which Plinydoes not appear to have been acquainted; amygdalite, which is perhapsthe sort which he speaks of as adulterated with bitter almonds; and lumpstorax, of reddish brown colour, which is frequently mixed with wood dust,or worm dust, as mentioned by Pliny, and is but little esteemed. The treeis also called Liquidambar styraciflua.</p></body>
