WHAT ANIMALS HAVETWO HEARTS.</head><p>Those animals are looked upon as stupid and lumpish whichhave a hard, rigid heart, while those in which it is small arecourageous, and those are timid which have it very large.The heart is the largest, in proportion to the body, in themouse, the hare, the ass, the stag, the panther, the weasel, thehy¾na, and all the animals, in fact, which are timid, or dangerous only from the effects of fear. In Paphlagonia the partridge has a double heart. In the heart of the horse and theox there are bones sometimes found. It is said that the heartincreases every year in man, and that two drachm¾ in weightare added<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> yearly up to the fiftieth year, after which periodit decreases yearly in a similar ratio; and that it is for thisreason that men do not live beyond their hundredth year, theheart then failing them: this is the notion entertained by theEgyptians, whose custom it is to embalm the bodies of the<pb n="3066" />dead, and so preserve them. It is said that men have beenborn with the heart covered with hair, and that such personsare excelled by none in valour and energy; such, for instance,as Aristomenes,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> the Messenian, who slew three hundredLaced¾monians. Being covered with wounds, and taken prisoner, he, on one occasion, made his escape by a narrow holewhich he discovered<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> in the stone quarry where he was imprisoned, while in pursuit of a fox which had found thatmode of exit. Being again taken prisoner, while his guardswere fast asleep he rolled himself towards a fire close by, and,at the expense of his body, burnt off the cords by which hewas bound. On being taken a third time, the Laced¾moniansopened his breast while he was still alive, and his heart wasfound covered with hair.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In spite of what Schenkius says in confirmation of Pliny, this isvery doubtful. Of course it must increase from childhood, but the increase surely does not continue till the fiftieth year.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See an account of him in the Messeniaca of Pausanias.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In this part of the story may have originated that of the escape ofSindbad the Sailor, when buried in the vault with the body of his wife.ÑSee the "Arabian Nights."</p></body>
