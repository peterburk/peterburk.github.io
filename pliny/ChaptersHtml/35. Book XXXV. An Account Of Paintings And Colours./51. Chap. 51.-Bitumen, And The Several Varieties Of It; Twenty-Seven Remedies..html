<div2 type="chapter" n="51" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 51.—BITUMEN, AND THE SEVERAL VARIETIES OF IT;TWENTY-SEVEN REMEDIES.</head><p>Nearly approaching to the nature of sulphur is that of bitumen,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>which in some places assumes the form of a slime, andin others that of an earth; a slime, thrown up, as already<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>stated, by a certain lake in Judæa, and an earth, found in thevicinity of Sidon, a maritime town of Syria. In both thesestates, it admits of being thickened and condensed. Thereis also a liquid<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> bitumen, that of Zacynthus, for example, andthe bitumen that is imported from Babylon; which last kindis also white: the bitumen, too, of Apollonia is liquid. Allthese kinds, in Greek, have the one general name of "pissasphaltos,"<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>from their strong resemblance to a compound ofpitch and bitumen. There is also found an unctuous liquidbitumen, resembling oil, in a spring at Agrigentum, in Sicily,the waters of which are tainted by it. The inhabitants of thespot collect it on the panicles of reeds, to which it very readilyadheres, and make use of it for burning in lamps, as a substitutefor oil, as also for the cure of itch-scab in beasts ofburden.</p><p>Some authorities include among the bitumens, naphtha, a substancewhich we have already mentioned in the Second Book;<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>but the burning properties which it possesses, and its susceptibilityof igniting, render it quite unfit for use. Bitumen,to be of good quality, should be extremely brilliant, heavy,and massive; it should also be moderately smooth, it beingvery much the practice to adulterate it with pitch. Its medi-<pb n="6294" />cinal properties are similar to those of sulphur, it being naturallyastringent, dispersive, contractive, and agglutinating: ignited,it drives away serpents by the smell. Babylonian bitumen isvery efficacious, it is said, for the cure of cataract and albugo,as also of leprosy, lichens, and pruriginous affections. Bitumenis employed, too, in the form of a liniment, for gout; andevery variety of it is useful for making bandolines for eyelashesthat are refractory and impede the sight. Applied topicallywith nitre,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> it is curative of tooth-ache, and, taken internally,with wine, it alleviates chronic coughs and difficultyof respiration. It is administered in a similar manner fordysentery, and is very good for arresting looseness of thebowels. Taken internally with vinegar, it dissolves and bringsaway coagulated blood. It modifies pains also in the loinsand joints, and, applied with barley-meal, it forms a peculiarkind of plaster, to which it has given its name.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> It stanchesblood also, heals wounds, and unites the sinews when severed.Bitumen is administered for quartan fevers, in doses of onedrachma to an equal quantity of hedyosmos,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> the whole kneadedup with one obolus of myrrh. The smell of burnt bitumendetects a tendency to epilepsy, and, applied to thenostrils with wine and castoreum,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> it dispels suffocations ofthe uterus. Employed as a fumigation, it acts as a check uponprocidence of the uterus, and, taken internally with wine, ithas the effect of an emmenagogue.</p><p>Another use that is made of it, is for coating the insideof copper vessels, it rendering them proof against the actionof fire. It has been already<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> stated that bitumen was formerlyemployed for staining copper and coating statues. It has beenused, too, as a substitute for lime; the walls of Babylon, forinstance, which are cemented with it. In the smithies they arein the habit of varnishing iron and heads of nails with it, andof using it for many other purposes as well.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There are three distinct kinds of bitumen. 1. Naphtha, also knownas petroleum, or rock-oil, inflammable, volatile, soluble in alcohol, andfound in France and Italy. 2. Asphalt, or bitumen of Judæa, solid, insolublein alcohol, and found in Lake Asphaltites in Syria, more particularly.3. Pissasphalt, of a medium consistency between the other substances,of which it appears to be composed.
