Inthis shell-fish there lies concealed also an animal known as thenauplius, which bears a strong resemblance to the sæpia, andonly adopts the shell-fish as the companion of its pastimes.There are two modes, he says, which it adopts in sailing;when the sea is calm, the voyager hangs down its arms,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> andstrikes the water with a pair of oars as it were; but if, on theother hand, the wind invites, it extends them, employingthem by way of a helm, and turning the mouth of the shell tothe wind. The pleasure experienced by the shell-fish is thatof carrying the other, while the amusement of the naupliusconsists in steering; and thus, at the same moment, is an instinctive joy felt by these two creatures, devoid as they are ofall sense, unless, indeed, a natural antipathy to man—for it isa well-known fact, that to see them thus sailing along, is a badomen, and that it is portentous of misfortune to those whowitness it.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier says, that this is only a reproduction, under another name, andwith other details, of the story of the nautilus or argonauta; but under theimpression that the polyp is not the animal which owns the shell, but isonly its associate. It has also been asserted in modern times, he says, thatthe polyp has seized this shell by force from some other animal, in orderto convert it into its boat; but the opinion has not been adopted, as theshell of the nautilus has been never found in the possession of any otheranimal.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably borrowed from the Greeks, who called it <foreign lang="greek">a)/katos.</foreign> It is supposed to have been a small boat, similar to the Roman "scapha;" like our"skiff" probably.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The "rostrum" of the ancient ships of war.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Palmulis." This word also means the blade or broad part of an oar;in which sense it may, perhaps, be here taken.</p></body>
