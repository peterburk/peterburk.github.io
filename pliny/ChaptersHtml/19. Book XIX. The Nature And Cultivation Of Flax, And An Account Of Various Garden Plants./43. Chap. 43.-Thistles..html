Forit is a well-known fact, that some small plots of land, plantedwith thistles,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> in the vicinity of Great Carthage and of Corduba more particularly, produce a yearly income of six thousandsesterces;<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> this being the way in which we make the monstrous productions even of the earth subservient to our gluttonous appetites, and that, too, when the very four-footedbrutes<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> instinctively refuse to touch them.</p><p>Thistles are grown two different ways, from plants set inautumn, and from seed sown before the nones of March;<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> inwhich latter case they are transplanted before the ides of November,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> or, where the site is a cold one, about the time thatthe west winds prevail. They are sometimes manured even,<pb n="4191" />and if<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> such is the will of heaven, grow all the better for it.They are preserved, too, in a mixture of honey and vinegar,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>with the addition of root of laser and cummin—so that a daymay not pass without our having thistles at table.<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably the artichoke, the Cinara scolymus of Linnæus.
