<div2 type="chapter" n="22" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 22. (18.)—THE GANGES.</head><p>Some writers have stated that this river, like the Nile,takes its rise from unknown sources,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and, in a similar manner,waters the neighbouring territory; others, again, say that it risesin the mountains of Scythia. They state also that nineteenrivers discharge their waters into it; those among them thatare navigable, besides the rivers already mentioned,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> are theCondochates,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> the Erannoboas,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> the Cosoagus,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> and theSonus. Other writers again say that it bursts forth at itsvery source with a loud noise, hurling itself over rocks andprecipices; and that after it has reached the plains, its watersbecome more tranquil, and it pauses for a time in a certainlake, after which it flows gently on. They say also that itis eight miles in breadth, where it is the very narrowest, and<pb n="2044" />one hundred stadia where it is but moderately wide, andthat it is nowhere less than twenty paces in depth. Thelast nation situate on the banks of the Ganges is that of theGangarides<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> Calingæ; the city where their king dwells hasthe name of Protalis.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>(19.) This king has sixty thousand foot-soldiers, one thousandhorse, and seven hundred elephants, always caparisoned readyfor battle. The people of the more civilized nations of Indiaare divided into several classes.<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> One of these classes tillsthe earth, another attends to military affairs, others againare occupied in mercantile pursuits, while the wisest and themost wealthy among them have the management of the affairsof state—act as judges, and give counsel to the king. Thefifth class,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> entirely devoting themselves to the pursuit of wisdom, which in these countries is almost held in the same veneration as religion, always<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> end their life by a voluntary deathupon the lighted pile. In addition to these, there is aclass<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> in a half-savage state, and doomed to endless labour;by means of their exertions, all the classes previously mentioned are supported. It is their duty to hunt<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> the elephant,and to tame him when captured; for it is by the aid of theseanimals that they plough; by these animals they are conveyed<pb n="2045" />from place to place; these in especial they look upon asconstituting their flocks and herds; by their aid they wagetheir wars, and fight in defence of their territories. Strength,age, and size, are the points usually considered in makingchoice of these animals.</p><p>In the Ganges there is an island of very considerablesize, inhabited by a single nation; it is called Modogalinga.<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> Beyond the Ganges are situate the Modubæ, theMolindæ, the Uberæ, with a magnificent city of the samename, the Modresi, the Preti, the Caloæ, the Sasuri, thePassalæ, the Colobæ, the Orumcolæ, the Abali, and the Thalutæ. The king of the last-named people has fifty thousandfoot-soldiers, four thousand horse, and four hundred armedelephants. We next come to a still more powerful nation,the Andaræ,<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> who dwell in numerous villages, as well as thirtycities fortified with walls and towers. They furnish fortheir king one hundred thousand foot, two thousand horse,and a thousand elephants. The country of the Dardæ<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> isthe most productive of gold, that of the Setæ of silver.</p><p>But more famous and more powerful than any nation, notonly in these regions, but throughout almost the whole ofIndia, are the Prasii, who dwell in a city of vast extent andof remarkable opulence, called Palibothra;<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> from which circumstance some writers have given to the people themselvesthe name of Palibothri, and, indeed, to the whole tract ofcountry between the Ganges and the Indus. These peoplekeep on daily pay in their king's service an army, consisting ofsix hundred thousand foot, thirty thousand horse, and ninethousand elephants, from which we may easily form a conjecture as to the vast extent of their resources. Behind these<pb n="2046" />people, and lying still more in the interior, are the Monedes,and the Suari,<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> among whom is a mountain known as Maleus,upon which the shadow falls to the north in winter, and tothe south in summer, six months alternately. In this districtthe Constellation of the Greater Bear<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> is seen at only oneperiod in the year, and then but for fifteen days, accordingto what Bæton states. Megasthenes, however, informs usthat the same is the case also in many other localities of India.The South Pole is by the Indians called Diamasa.</p><p>The river Jomanes runs into the Ganges through the territory of the Palibothri, between the cities of Methora<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> andChrysobora.<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> In the regions which lie to the south<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> of theGanges, the people are tinted by the heat of the sun, so muchso as to be quite coloured, but yet not burnt black, like theÆthiopians. The nearer<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> they approach the Indus, thedeeper their colour, a proof of the heat of the climate. Afterleaving the nation of the Prasii, we immediately come to theIndus; in the mountains of the Prasii a race of Pygmiesis said to exist. Artemidorus says that between these tworivers there is a distance of two thousand one hundredmiles.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">So much so, indeed, that its sources were unknown to the learnedworld till the beginning of the present century, although the Chinese emperor Tang-Hi on one occasion sent a body of Llamas for the purpose ofinquiring into the subject. It is now ascertained that the river Ganges isthe result of the confluence of three separate streams, which bear the respective names of the Gannavi, the Bhagirathi, and the Alakananda. Thesecond is of the most sacred character, and is the one to which the largestconcourse of pilgrims resort. The ancients held various opinions as tothe sources of the river.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Cainas and the Jomanes, mentioned in the last Chapter.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The modern Gandaki or Gundûk is generally supposed to be represented by the Condochates.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Represented as flowing into the Ganges at Palimbothra, the modernPatna. There has been considerable discussion among the learned as towhat river is indicated by this name. It has, however, been consideredmost probable that it is the same as the Sonus of Pliny, the modern Soane,though both that author, as well as Arrian, speaks of two rivers, whichthey call respectively Erannoboas and Sonus. The name was probablyderived from the Sanscrit Hyranyavahas, the poetical name of the Sonus.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Supposed to be the same as the river Cosi or Coravaha.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The wide diffusion of the Calingæ and their close connection with theGangaridæ, are shown by the fact that Pliny here calls them "Calingæ;Gangarides," and mentions the Modogalingæ on a large island in theGanges, and the Maccocalingæ on the upper course of that river. See note43, p. 42.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Called Parthalis in most of the editions.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or <hi rend="ital">castes,</hi> as we call them. These institutions prevail equally at thepresent day, and the divisions of the duties of the respective castes arepretty much as Pliny states them to be, except that the husbandmen andmerchants form one class, called the Vaisya, the Brahmins being the ministersof religion, the Kshatriya forming the warlike class, the Sudra constituting the menial or servant class. Pliny here represents the rulers andcouncillors as forming a distinct class. Such, however, does not appear tobe the fact; for we find that the sovereign is chosen from the Kshatriya ormilitary class, while from the Brahmins are selected the royal councillors,judges, and magistrates of the country.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He alludes to the Brahmins, who seem to have been called by the Greekwriters "Gymnosophists," or "naked wise men." The Brahmin Calanus is a memorable example of this kind of self-immolation.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is extremely doubtful if, even in his own day, Pliny was correct inventuring upon so sweeping an assertion.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Sudra or menial caste.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He is incorrect here; these duties devolve on the Vaisya class.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Inhabited, probably, by a branch of the Calingæ previously mentioned.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ansart suggests that this may be the modern kingdom of Pegu. Hethinks also that the preceding kingdom may be that now called Arracan.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">These may possibly be the Daradræ of Ptolemy, but it seems impossible to guess their locality.</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably the present Patna. D'Anville, however, identifies it withAllahabad, while Welford and Wahl are inclined to think it the same asRadjeurah, formerly called Balipoutra or Bengala. The Prasii are probably the race of people mentioned in the ancient Sanscrit books under thename of the "Pragi" or the Eastern Empire, while the Gangarides are mentioned in the same works under the name of "Gandaressa" or Kingdom ofthe Ganges.</p><p><span id="note_17"><a href="#ref_17">17. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hardouin is of opinion that these nations dwelt in the localities occupied by the districts of Gwalior and Agra.</p><p><span id="note_18"><a href="#ref_18">18. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Septentriones or "Seven Trions," in the original. Parisot isof opinion that under this name of Mount Maleus he alludes to theWestern Ghauts, and that the name still survives in the word Malabar.He also remarks that this statement of Pliny is not greatly exaggerated.</p><p><span id="note_19"><a href="#ref_19">19. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ansart says that this is the same as the modern town of Muttra orMatra upon the Jumna, and to the north of Agra.</p><p><span id="note_20"><a href="#ref_20">20. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or Clisobora, according to Hardouin. It does not appear to havebeen identified.</p><p><span id="note_21"><a href="#ref_21">21. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In the Indian Peninsula, constituting more especially the presidencyof Madras.</p><p><span id="note_22"><a href="#ref_22">22. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is clear that he looks upon the countries of the Indus as lying tothe south of the Ganges.</p></body>
