Theprovince of Nearer Spain used formerly to be the only onethat furnished it—not, indeed, the whole of that country, buta district extending for a hundred miles around the city ofSegobrica<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> But at the present day, Cyprus, Cappadocia, andSicily, supply us with it; and, still more recently, it has beendiscovered in Africa: they are all, however, looked upon asinferior to the stone which comes from Spain. The sheets<pb n="6369" />from Cappadocia are the largest in size; but then they areclouded. This stone is to be found also in the territory ofBononia,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> in Italy; but in small pieces only, covered withspots and encrusted in a bed of silex, there being a considerableaffinity, it would appear, in their nature.</p><p>In Spain, the specular-stone is extracted from shafts sunkin the earth to a very considerable depth; though it is occasionallyto be found just beneath the surface, enclosed in thesolid rock, and extracted without difficulty, or else cut awayfrom its bed. In most cases, however, it admits of being dugup, being of an isolated nature, and lying in pieces, like ragstone,but never known as yet to exceed five feet in length.It would appear that this substance is originally a liquid,which, by an animating power in the earth, becomes congealedlike crystal; and it is very evident that it is the result of petrifaction,from the fact that, when animals have fallen into theshafts from which it is extracted, the marrow of their bonesbecomes transformed into stone of a similar nature, by the endof a single winter. In some cases, too, it is found of a blackcolour: but the white stone has the marvellous property, softas it is known to be, of resisting the action of the sun and ofcold. Nor will it, if it is only protected from accidents,become deteriorated by lapse of time, a thing that is so generallythe case with many other kinds of stone that are usedfor building purposes. The shavings, too, and scales of thisstone, have been used of late for another purpose; the CircusMaximus having been strewed with them at the celebration ofthe games, with the object of producing an agreeable whiteness.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "Mirror-stone."
