Hippocrates, one of the most famous writers onmedical science, has devoted a whole volume to the praises ofthis aliment. The ptisan of the highest quality is that whichis made at Utica; that of Egypt is prepared from a kind ofbarley, the grain of which grows with two points.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> In Balticand Africa, the kind of barley from which this food is made isthat which Turranius calls the "smooth"<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> barley: the sameauthor expresses an opinion, too, that olyra<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and rice are thesame.

Dalechamps interprets this as two rows of grain; butFée thinks that it signifies angles, and points.
