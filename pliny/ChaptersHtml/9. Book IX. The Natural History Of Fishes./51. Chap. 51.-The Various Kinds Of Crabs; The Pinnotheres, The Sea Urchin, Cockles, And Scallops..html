<div2 type="chapter" n="51" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 51.—THE VARIOUS KINDS OF CRABS; THE PINNOTHERES, THE SEA URCHIN, COCKLES, AND SCALLOPS.</head><p>There are various kinds of crabs,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> known as carabi,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> astaci,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span><pb n="2425" />maiæ,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> paguri,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> heracleotici,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> lions,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> and others of lessnote. The carabus differs<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> from other crabs, in having a tail:in Phoenicia they are called hippoi,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> or horses, being of suchextraordinary swiftness, that it is impossible to overtakethem. Crabs are long-lived, and have eight feet, all ofwhich are bent obliquely. In the female<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> the first foot is<pb n="2426" />double, in the male single; besides which, the animal has twoclaws with indented pincers. The upper part only of thesefore-feet is moveable, the lower being immoveable: the rightclaw is the largest in them all.<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> Sometimes they assembletogether in large bodies; <span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> but as they are unable to cross themouth of the Euxine, they turn back again and go round byland, and the road by which they travel is to be seen all beatendown with their foot-marks.</p><p>The smallest crab of any is that known as the pinnotheres,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>and hence it is peculiarly exposed to danger; its shrewdness,however, is evinced by its concealing itself in the shell of theoyster; and as it grows larger, it removes to those of a largersize.</p><p>Crabs, when alarmed, go backwards as swiftly as whenmoving forwards. They fight with one another like rams,butting at each other with their horns. They have<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> a mode ofcuring themselves of the bites of serpents. It is said,<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> that<pb n="2427" />while the sun is passing through the sign of Cancer, the deadbodies of the crabs, which are lying thrown up on the shore,are transformed into serpents.</p><p>To the same class<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> also belongs the sea-urchin,<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> which hasspines in place of feet<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> its mode of moving along is to rolllike a ball, hence it is that these animals are often found withtheir prickles rubbed off. Those among them which have thelongest spines of all, are known by the name of echinometræ,<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span>while at the same time their body is the very smallest. Theyare not all of them of the same glassy colour; in the vicinityof Torone<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> they are white,<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> with very short spines. The eggs<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span>of all of them are bitter, and are five in number; the mouthis situate in the middle of the body, and faces the earth.<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span> It issaid <span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span> that these creatures foreknow the approach of a storm atsea, and that they take up little stones with which they cover<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span>themselves, and so provide a sort of ballast against their volubility, for they are very unwilling by rolling along to wearaway their prickles. As soon as seafaring persons observethis, they at once moor their ship with several anchors.</p><p>(32.) To the same genus<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span> also belong both land and water<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span>snails, which thrust the body forth from their abode, andextend or contract two horns, as it were. They are without<pb n="2428" />eyes,<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span> and have, therefore, to feel their way, by means ofthese horns.</p><p>(33.) Sea-scallops<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span> are considered to belong to the sameclass, which also conceal themselves during severe frosts andgreat heats; the onyches,<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span> too, which shine in the dark likefire, and in the mouth even while being eaten.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. iv. c. 2, has a somewhat similar passage."The kinds of crabs are numerous, and not easily to be enumerated.First, there are those known as maim, then the paguri, which are alsocalled 'heracleotici;' and, after them, the river crabs. There are others,again, of a smaller size, and which, for the most part, are known by noname in particular."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is, no doubt, the cray-fish, the same animal that has been calledthe "locusta" in the preceding Chapter. Aristotle states, B. iv. c. 8, thatthe carabus has the thorax rough and spiny. It is most probable, that itis from this name that our word "crab" is derived.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier says, that the astacus, which is very accurately described byAristotle, Hist. Anim. B. iv. c. 8, is indisputably the homard of theFrench (the common lobster of the English); the Cancer gammarius ofLinnæus. Pliny, in another place, B. xxx. c. ii., describes it himself underthe name of elephantus.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier remarks, that according to Aristotle, B. iv. c. 2, the maiæ arein the number of the <foreign lang="greek">karki/noi,</foreign> or crabs that have a short tail concealedbeneath the body, being those of the largest kind. The same philosopher,De Part. Anim. B. iv. c. 8, adds, that these have also short feet and a hardshell. Cuvier says, that many writers have applied this name to the crabsat the present day belonging to the genus inachus, and more especially theCancer maia of Linnæus. He is more inclined, however, to think that themaia was the common French crab, known as poupart or tourtue, theCancer pagurus of Linnæus.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hardouin says, that these are the same that the Venetians were in thehabit of calling "cancro poro," the last word being a corruption, as hethinks, of pagurus. Aristotle says, <hi rend="ital">loc. cit.,</hi> that they were crabs of middling size.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or Heracleotic crabs. Aristotle says, De Partib. Anim. B. iv. c. 8,that these crabs had shorter feet and thinner than those of the maiæ.Cuvier suggests, that these may be the commonest kind of crab, the CancerMænas of Linnæus, or a species very similar.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Leones." This name is not found in Aristotle's account, but it isfound in Athenæus, B. iii. c. 106; and in Ælian, Hist. Anim. B. xiv. c. 9.According to Diphilus, as quoted by Atheneus, it was of larger size thanthe astacus. Ælian describes it as more slender in shape than the crayfish, and partly of a bluish colour, and with very large forcipes, in whichit resembles, Cuvier says, the homard of the French. It is possible, however, he adds, that it may have been only a second name given to theastacus already mentioned; as both Pliny and Ælian, who were not critical observers, are very liable to make errors in names.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle, Cuvier observes, states the carcini, or crabs, have no tail,the fact being that the tail is extremely small, and is concealed, as it were,in a furrow in the under part of the body. The cray-fish, on the otherhand, has a large and broad tail.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot"><foreign lang="greek">(Ippoi\.</foreign> The more common reading is <foreign lang="greek">i(ppe=is,</foreign> "horsemen." Cuvierthinks, that in all probability, these are a kind of crab with very long legs,vulgarly known as the sea-spider; the Macropodia and the Leptopodia ofLinnæus.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hardouin remarks, that Aristotle says this only of the carabi, orcray-fish, and not of the crabs in general; and that, on the contrary, in B.v. c. 7, he says, that in the crab the male does not differ in conformationfrom the female, except in the opercule. There seems, in reality, to beno foundation for the statement here made by Pliny.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Both in the crab and the cray-fish, Aristotle says.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ælian, Hist. Anim. B. vii. c. 24, calls this kind of crab <foreign lang="greek">dromi/as,</foreign>the "runner," from the great distance it is known to travel. He says,that they meet together, coming in one by one, at a certain bay in theThracian Bosporus, where those who have arrived wait for the others; andthat on finding that the waves of the Euxine are sufficiently violent tosweep them away, they unite in a dense body, and then waiting till thewaters have retired, make a passage across the straits.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier remarks, that Hardouin is correct in considering this the sameas the crab known in France as Bernard the Hermit (our hermit-crab), tileCancer Bernardus of Linnæus, a species of the genus now known as thePagur. This animal hides its tail and lower extremities in the empty shellsof whelks, or other univalves. Cuvier suggests that our author committeda slip of the pen, in using the word oyster here for shell-fish. This is the<foreign lang="greek">karki/nion,</foreign> probably, of Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. v. c. 16, and De Part.Anim. B. iv. c. 8; and it is most probable that, as Cuvier states, the real<foreign lang="greek">pinnoth/rhs</foreign> of Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. iv. c. 4, and B. v. c. 14, wasanother of the crustacea, of which Pliny speaks under the same name inc. 66. This last is a small crab, that lives in the shells of bivalves, suchas mussels, &amp;, but not when empty. See the Notes to c. 66.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This circumstance is more fully treated of in B. xxxii. c. 19,</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Our author speaks rather more guardedly here than usual; and Har-douin seems almost inclined to believe the story. Ovid also alludes to thisstory in the Met. B. xv. 1. 370, <hi rend="ital">et seq.</hi> "If you take off the bending clawsfrom the crab of the sea-shore, and bury the rest in the earth, a scorpionwill come forth from the part so buried, and will threaten with its crookedtail."</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Of animals covered with a thin crust.</p><p><span id="note_17"><a href="#ref_17">17. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The sea-urchin, the herisson de mer of the French, and the Echinusof Linnæus.</p><p><span id="note_18"><a href="#ref_18">18. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier remarks, that it does not use the spines or prickles for thispurpose, but that it moves by means of tentacules, which it projects frombetween its prickles.</p><p><span id="note_19"><a href="#ref_19">19. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Echinus cidaris of Linnæus; with a small body, and very longspines. The name, according to Hardouin, is from the Greek, meaningthe "mother of the echini."</p><p><span id="note_20"><a href="#ref_20">20. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. iv. c. 17.</p><p><span id="note_21"><a href="#ref_21">21. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The same, Cuvier says, with the Echinus spatagus of Linnæus.</p><p><span id="note_22"><a href="#ref_22">22. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Not "ova," Cuvier says, but "ovaria" rather. Each urchin has five"ovaria," arranged in the form of stars. They are supposed to be hermaphroditical, but there is considerable doubt on the subject.</p><p><span id="note_23"><a href="#ref_23">23. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The mouth of the sea-urchin, armed with five teeth, is generally turnedto the ground, Cuvier says.</p><p><span id="note_24"><a href="#ref_24">24. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Plutarch, in his Book "on the Instincts of Animals." Oppian, Halieut.B. ii. 1. 225, and Ælian, Hist. Anim. B. vii. c. 44, all mention this.</p><p><span id="note_25"><a href="#ref_25">25. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This idea probably arose from the fact of their being sometimes foundwith stones sticking between their spines or prickles.</p><p><span id="note_26"><a href="#ref_26">26. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The thin-crusted animals.</p><p><span id="note_27"><a href="#ref_27">27. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Known to us as periwinkles.</p><p><span id="note_28"><a href="#ref_28">28. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is now known, thanks to the research of Swammerdam, that theblack points at the extremity of the great horns of the land snail, or Helixterrestris, and at the base of them in the water snail, are eyes.</p><p><span id="note_29"><a href="#ref_29">29. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Pectines in mari;" literally, "sea-combs."

They are known also in France as"coquilles de St. Jaques," or St. James's shells; probably, because wornby pilgrims who had visited the shrine of St. Jago, at Compostella. In-deed, the scallop shell was a favourite emblem with the palmers and pilgrims of the middle ages, who were in the habit of wearing it on theirreturn in the hat.</p><p><span id="note_30"><a href="#ref_30">30. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He Latinizes the Greek name, calling it "unguis"—"a nail;" and,according to Varro, they were so called from their resemblance to the human nail. Pliny mentions them again in c. 87 of this Book, and in B.xxxii. c. 53, where he states that they are also called "dactyli," or "fingers." Cuvier says, that under this name are meant the pholades, a bivalve shell-fish, which give forth a very brilliant light.</p></body>
