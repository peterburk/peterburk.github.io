Marcellus, too, at the taking of Syracuse, offered a remarkable homage to the sciences of geometry and mechanics,by giving orders that Archimedes was to be the only personwho should not be molested; his commands, however, weredisregarded, in consequence of the imprudence of one of thesoldiers.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> Chersiphron, also, the Cnossian,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> was rendered fa-<pb n="2184" />mous by the admirable construction of the temple of Diana atEphesus; Philon, by the construction of the basin at Athens,which was capable of containing one thousand vessels;<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> Cte-sibius, by the invention of pneumatics and hydraulic machines; and Dinochares,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> by the plan which he made of the cityof Alexandria, founded by Alexander in Egypt. The samemonarch, too, by public edict, declared that no one shouldpaint his portrait except Apelles, and that no one should make amarble statue of him except Pyrgoteles, or a bronze one exceptLysippus.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> These arts have all been rendered glorious bymany illustrious examples.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is related more at large by Val.

He built for Demetrius Phalereus, about B.C. <date value="-318" authname="-318">318</date>, the porticoof twelve Doric columns to the great temple at Eleusis. He also formeda basin in the Pir¾us, which was destroyed at the taking of Athens by theRomans under Sylla.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. v. c. 11, and B. xxxiv. c. 42.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Plutarch, in his life of Alexander, mentions the restriction made infavour of Lysippus, but does not extend it to Apelles; he does not speak ofPyrgoteles. We have an apposite allusion to this circumstance by Horace,Ep. B. i. 1. 239, 240. Boileau has elegantly imitated Horace, in his "Discours au Roi."ÑB. For further particulars of him, see B. xxxiv. c. 17and 19. He was a native of Sicyon, and at first a simple worker in bronze,but eventually obtained the highest rank among the Grecian statuaries.</p></body>
