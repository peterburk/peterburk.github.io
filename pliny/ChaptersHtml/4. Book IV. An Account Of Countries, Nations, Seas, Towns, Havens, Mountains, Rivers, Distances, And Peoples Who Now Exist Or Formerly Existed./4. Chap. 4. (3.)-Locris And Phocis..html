(3.)—LOCRIS AND PHOCIS.</head><p>Next to Ætolia are the Locri<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>, surnamed Ozolæ; a peopleexempt from tribute. Here is the town of Œanthe<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>,the port<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> of Apollo Phæstius, and the Gulf of Crissa<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>. Inthe interior are the towns of Argyna, Eupalia<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>, Phæstum,and Calamisus. Beyond are the Cirrhaean plains of Phocis,the town of Cirrha<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>, and the port of Chalæon<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>, seven miles<pb n="1277" />from which, in the interior, is situate the free town of Delphi<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>,at the foot of Mount Parnassus<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>, and having the mostcelebrated oracle of Apollo throughout the whole world. There isthe Fountain too of Castalia<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>, and the river Cephisus<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> whichflows past Delphi, rising in the former city of Lilæa<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>. Besidesthese, there is the town of Crissa<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> and that of Anticyra<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>, withthe Bulenses<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>; as also Naulochum<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span>, Pyrrha, Amphissa<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span>,exempt from all tribute, Tithrone, Tritea<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span>, Ambrysus<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span>, andDrymæa<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span>, which district has also the name of Daulis. Theextremity of the gulf washes one corner of Bœotia, with itstowns of Siphæ<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> and Thebes<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span>, surnamed the Corsian, in the<pb n="1278" />vicinity of Helicon<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span>. The third town of Bœotia on thissea is that of Pagæ<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span>, from which point the Isthmus of thePeloponnesus projects in the form of a neck.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">They are supposed to have inhabited the modern districts ofMalandrino and Salone. They were called "Ozolæ" or'strong-smelling,'either from the undressed skins worn by them, or from the quantities ofasphodel that grew in their country; or else from the vapours thrownoff by the mineral springs in those parts.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pouqueville imagines its ruins to be those seen about two leaguesfrom the modern Galaxidi.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Lapie marks this in his map as the modern port of Ianakhi.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">So called from the ancient town of Crissa, which stood on it. It isthe same as the modern Gulf of Salona.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or Eupalium. Leake supposes it to have stood in the plain ofMarathia, opposite the islands of Trazonia, where some ruins stillexist.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pausanias makes this town to be the same with the Homeric Crissa,but Strabo distinguishes the two places, and his opinion is now generallyfollowed; Cirrha being thought to have been built at the head of theCrissæan gulf, as the port of Crissa. Its ruins are thought to be thosewhich bear the modern name of Magula.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or Chalæum. Pliny erroneously calls it a town of Phocis, it beingon the coast of the Locri Ozolæ. He is wrong also in placing it sevenmiles from Delphi, and not improbably confounded it with Cirrha. Leakesuggests that its site was the present Larnaki.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The modern village of Kastri stands on part of the site of ancientDelphi. Its ruins have been explored by Chandler, Leake, and Ulrichs.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The two highest summits of the range of Parnassus in the vicinityof Delphi were Tithorea, now Velitza, to the N.W., and Lycorea, nowLiakura, to the N.E. Its rocks above Delphi were called the Phædriadesor "Resplendent."</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The famed Castalian spring is now called the Fountain of St. John,from the chapel of that saint which stands close to its source.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now the Mavro-Potamo.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Its ruins are still to be seen about three leagues from Kastri.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or Crisso. It was situate inland to the S.W. of Delphi. Its ruinsare to be seen at a short distance from the modern village of Chryso.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is supposed that the few ruins seen near the modern Aspra Spitiaare those of this place. It was famous for its hellebore, which was extensively used for the cure of madness. There were two other places orthe same name.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The people of Bulis, near the Crissæan Gulf. Its ruins are situateat a short distance from the monastery of Dobé.</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ansart suggests that this was the present port of Agio-Sideri orDjesphina.</p><p><span id="note_17"><a href="#ref_17">17. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It occupied the site of the modern Salona; the walls of its ancientAcropolis are still to be seen. It was the chief town of the LocriOzolæ.</p><p><span id="note_18"><a href="#ref_18">18. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pouqueville thinks that the ruins seen near Moulki are those ofTithrone, and that Tritea stood on the site of the presentTurcochorion.</p><p><span id="note_19"><a href="#ref_19">19. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or Amphrysus, famous for the strength of its fortifications and itsscarlet berries for dyeing. Some remains of it are to be seen at themodern village of Dhistomo.</p><p><span id="note_20"><a href="#ref_20">20. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">On the frontiers of Doris and Phocis. Leake thinks that its ruinsare those seen midway between Kamares and Glamista. Daulis was alsothe name of an ancient town of Phocis, the ruins of which are to be seenat the modern village of Dhavlia.</p><p><span id="note_21"><a href="#ref_21">21. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably the present Palæo Kastro, at the Port de Dobrena orPolaca.</p><p><span id="note_22"><a href="#ref_22">22. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Leake thinks that the Corsian Thebes, a port of Bœotia, isrepresented by the modern Khosia.</p><p><span id="note_23"><a href="#ref_23">23. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Helicon is a range of mountains with several summits, the loftiest ofwhich is now called Paleovuni. Helicon was a grove of the Muses, andthe fountain of Aganippe was supposed to impart poetic inspiration tothose who drank of it.</p><p><span id="note_24"><a href="#ref_24">24. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See p. 288.</p></body>
