(6.)—REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE BLOSSOMS, LEAVES,FRUIT, BRANCHES, BARK, JUICES, WOOD, ROOTS, AND ASHES OFVARIOUS KINDS OF TREES. SIX OBSERVATIONS UPON APPLES.TWENTY-TWO OBSERVATIONS UPON QUINCES. ONE OBSERVATIONUPON STRUTHEA.</head><p>We next come to the medicinal properties of the variouskinds of apples. The spring fruits of this nature are sour andunwholesome<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> to the stomach, disturb the bowels, contract thebladder, and act injuriously upon the nerves; when cooked,however, they are of a more harmless nature. Quinces aremore pleasant eating when cooked; still however, eatenraw, provided they are ripe, they are very useful<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> for spittingof blood, dysentery, cholera, and cœliac affections; indeed,they are not of the same efficacy when cooked, as they thenlose the astringent properties which belong to their juice.They are applied also to the breast in the burning attacks offever, and, in spite of what has been stated above, they areoccasionally boiled in rain-water for the various purposes before-mentioned. For pains in the stomach they are applied<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>like a cerate, either raw or boiled. The down upon themheals<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> carbuncles.</p><p>Boiled in wine, and applied with wax, they restore the hair,when it has been lost by alopecy. A conserve of raw quincesin honey relaxes the bowels; and they add very materially tothe sweetness of the honey, and render it more wholesome tothe stomach. Boiled quinces preserved in honey are beatenup with a decoction of rose-leaves, and are taken as food by some<pb n="4497" />for the cure of affections of the stomach. The juice of raw quincesis very good, also, for the spleen, hardness of breathing, dropsy,affections of the mamillæ, condylomata, and varicose veins.The blossoms, either fresh or dried, are useful for inflammations of the eyes, spitting of blood, and irregularities of thecatamenia. By beating them up with sweet wine, a sooth-ing sirop is prepared, which, is very beneficial for cœliacaffections and diseases of the liver: with a decoction of thema fomentation is made for procidence of the uterus and intestines.</p><p>From quinces an oil is also extracted, which we have spokenof under the name of "melinum:"<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> in order to make it, thefruit must not have been grown in a damp soil; hence it isthat the quinces which come from Sicily are so highly esteemedfor the purpose; while, on the other hand, the strutheum,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>though of a kindred kind, is not so good.</p><p>A circle<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> is traced round the root of this tree, and the rootitself is then pulled up with the left hand, care being takenby the person who does so to state at the same moment theobject for which it is so pulled up, and for whom. Worn asan amulet, this root is a cure for scrofula.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In consequence of the malic and tartaric acid which they contain.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Quinces are of an astringent nature; and an astringent sirop, Féesays, is still prepared from them.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">They are no longer used for this purpose.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Fée observes that it has no such effect.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">B. xiii. c. 2.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "sparrow-quince."
