This substance is calledcastoreum by the physicians.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> In addition to this, the biteof this animal is terrible; with its teeth it can cut down trees<pb n="2298" />on the banks of rivers, just as though with a knife.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> If theyseize a man by any part of his body, they will never loosetheir hold until his bones are broken and crackle under theirteeth. The tail is like that of a fish;<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> in the other parts ofthe body they resemble the otter;<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> they are both of themaquatic animals, and both have hair softer than down.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"De aquaticis et iisdem terrestribus;" although these words are inserted in the title of this Chapter, the subject is not treated of in it.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny here adopts the vulgar opinion respecting the origin of thesubstance called "castor," and in B. xxxii. c. 13, gives a more correct description, which he had derived from a physician, named Sextius. It isa fetid, oily substance, secreted by a gland situate near the prepuce. Cuvier remarks, that when the gland becomes distended with this secretion,the animal may probably get rid of it by rubbing the part against a stoneor tree, and in this way, leave the castor for the hunters, thus giving riseto the vulgar error. Ajasson, vol. vi. p. 448; Lemaire, vol. iii. p. 440.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The beaver has the most powerful teeth of any animal of the classRodentia, to which it belongs; it uses them for cutting down trees, withwhich it constructs its habitation. Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 5,refers to this.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The tail is covered with a kind of scale, and is flattened; but, in itsinternal organization, is formed like those of other quadrupeds.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxxii. c. 52.</p></body>
