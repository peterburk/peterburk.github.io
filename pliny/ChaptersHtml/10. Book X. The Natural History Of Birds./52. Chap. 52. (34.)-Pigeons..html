(34.)—PIGEONS.</head><p>Next to the partridge, it is in the pigeon that similar tendencies are to be seen in the same respect: but then, chastityis especially observed by it, and promiscuous intercourse is athing quite unknown. Although inhabiting a domicile incommon with others, they will none of them violate the lawsof conjugal fidelity: not one will desert its nest, unless it iseither widower or widow. Although, too, the males are veryimperious, and sometimes even extremely exacting, the femalesput up with it: for in fact, the males sometimes suspect them ofinfidelity, though by nature they are incapable of it. Onsuch occasions the throat of the male seems quite choked withindignation, and he inflicts severe blows with the beak: and<pb n="2518" />then afterwards, to make some atonement, he falls to billing, and by way of pressing his amorous solicitations, sidlesround and round the female with his feet. They both of themmanifest an equal degree of affection for their offspring; in-deed, it is not unfrequently that this is a ground for correction,in consequence of the female being too slow in going to heryoung. When the female is sitting, the male renders her everyattention that can in any way tend to her solace and comfort.The first thing that they do is to eject from the throat somesaltish earth, which they have digested, into the mouths ofthe young ones, in order to prepare them in due time to receive their nutriment. It is a peculiarity of the pigeon andof the turtle-dove, not to throw back the neck when drinking,but to take in the water at a long draught, just as beasts ofburden do.</p><p>(35.) We read in some authors that the ring-dove lives solong as thirty years, and sometimes as much as forty, withoutany other inconvenience than the extreme length of the claws,which with them, in fact, is the chief mark of old age; theycan be cut, however, without any danger. The voice of allthese birds is similar, being composed of three notes, and thena mournful noise at the end. In winter they are silent, and theyonly recover their voice in the spring. Nigidius expresses itas his opinion that the ring-dove will abandon the place, if shehears her name mentioned under the roof where she is sittingon her eggs: they hatch their young just after<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> the summersolstice. Pigeons and turtle-doves live eight years.</p><p>(36.) The sparrow, on the other hand, which has an equaldegree of salaciousness, is short-lived in the extreme. It issaid that the male does not live beyond a year; and as a groundfor this belief, it is stated that at the beginning of spring, theblack marks are never to be seen upon the beak which beganto appear in the summer. The females, however, are saidto live somewhat longer.</p><p>Pigeons have even a certain appreciation of glory. Thereis reason for believing that they are well aware of the coloursof their plumage, and the various shades which it presents, andeven in their very mode of flying they court our applause, asthey cleave the air in every direction. It is, indeed, through<pb n="2519" />this spirit of ostentation that they are handed over, fast boundas it were, to the hawk; for from the noise that they make,which, in fact, is only produced by the flapping of their wings,their long feathers become twisted and disordered: otherwise,when they can fly without any impediment, they are far swifterin their movements than the hawk. The robber, lurking amidthe dense foliage, keeps on the look-out for them, and seizesthem at the very moment that they are indulging their vainglorious self-complaisance.</p><p>(37.) It is for this reason that it is necessary to keep alongwith the pigeons the bird that is known as the "tinnunculus;"<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> as it protects them, and by its natural superiorityscares away the hawk; so much so, indeed, that the hawk willvanish at the very sight of it, and the instant it hears itsvoice. Hence it is that the pigeons have an especial regardfor this bird; and, it is said, if one of these birds is buriedat each of the four corners of the pigeon-house in pots thathave been newly glazed, the pigeons will not change theirabode—a result which has been obtained by some by cutting ajoint of their wings with an instrument of gold; for if anyother were used, the wounds would be not unattended withdanger.—The pigeon in general may be looked upon as a birdfond of change; they have the art, too, among themselves ofgaining one another over, and so seducing their companions:hence it is that we frequently find them return attended byothers which they have enticed away.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xviii. c. 68; where he says that the summer solstice is past atthe time of the incubation.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier takes this to be the kestril, or Falco tinnunculus of Linneus,and considers it to be synonymous with the cenchris, mentioned in c. 73,and in B. xxix. c. 6, though Pliny does not seem to be aware of theidentity.</p></body>
