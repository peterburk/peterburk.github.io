Thesame is the case, too, with the vine,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and more particularlythe more fruitful varieties. Græcinus informs us that vineshave lasted so long as sixty years. It appears, also, that theaquatic trees die the soonest. The laurel,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> the apple, andthe pomegranate age rapidly, it is true, but then they throwout fresh shoots at the root. The olive must be looked upon,then, as being one of the most long-lived, for it is generallyagreed among authors that it will last two hundred years.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The pomegranate, on the contrary, has been known to live many cen-turies.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He has elsewhere said that the vine is extremely long-lived.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In the last Chapter he has spoken of a laurel having existed for manycenturies.</p></body>
