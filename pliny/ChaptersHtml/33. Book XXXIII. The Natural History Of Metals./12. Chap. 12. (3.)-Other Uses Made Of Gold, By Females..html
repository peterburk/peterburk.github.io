<div2 type="chapter" n="12" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 12. (3.)—OTHER USES MADE OF GOLD, BY FEMALES.</head><p>To honour the gods at their sacrifices, no greater mark ofhonour has been thought of than to gild the horns of the animalssacrificed—that is, of the larger victims<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> only. But in warfare,this species of luxury made such rapid advances, that in theEpistles of M. Brutus from the Plains of Philippi, we find expressionsof indignation at the fibulæ<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> of gold that were wornby the tribunes. Yes, so it is, by Hercules! and yet you, thesame Brutus, have not said a word about women wearing goldupon their feet; while we, on the other hand, charge him withcriminality<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> who was the first to confer dignity upon gold bywearing the ring. Let men even, at the present day, wear goldupon the arms in form of bracelets—known as "dardania,"because the practice first originated in Dardania, and called"viriolæ" in the language of the Celts, "viriæ"<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> in that ofCeltiberia, let women wear gold upon their arms<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> andall their fingers, their necks, their ears, the tresses of theirhair; let chains of gold run meandering along their sides;and in the still hours of the night let sachets filled with pearlshang suspended from the necks of their mistresses, all bedizenedwith gold, so that in their very sleep even they may stillretain the consciousness that they are the possessors of such<pb n="6088" />gems: but are they to cover their feet<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> as well with gold, andso, between the stola<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> of the matrons and the garb of theplebeians, establish an intermediate<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> or equestrian<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> order offemales? Much more becomingly do we accord this distinctionto our pages,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> and the adorned beauty of these youths hasquite changed the features of our public baths.</p><p>At the present day, too, a fashion has been introducedamong the men even, of wearing effigies upon their fingersrepresenting Harpocrates<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> and other divinities of Egypt. Inthe reign of Claudius, also, there was introduced anotherunusual distinction, in the case of those to whom was grantedthe right of free admission,<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> that, namely, of wearing thelikeness of the emperor engraved in gold upon a ring: acircumstance that gave rise to vast numbers of informations,until the timely elevation of the Emperor Vespasianus renderedthem impossible, by proclaiming that the right of admission tothe emperor belonged equally to all. Let these particularssuffice on the subject of golden rings and the use of them.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Oxen, namely.
