(26.)—THE MEMNONIDES.</head><p>There are some authors who say that every year certainbirds<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> fly from Æthiopia to Ilium, and have a combat at thetomb of Memnon there; from which circumstance they havereceived from them the name of Memnonides, or birds ofMemnon. Cremutius states it also as a fact, ascertained by<pb n="2507" />himself, that they do the same every fifth year in Æthiopia,around the palace of Memnon.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier suggests, that these birds may have been the Tringa pugnaxof Linnæus and Buffon, the males of which engage in most bloody combatswith each other on the banks of livers, in spring.</p></body>
