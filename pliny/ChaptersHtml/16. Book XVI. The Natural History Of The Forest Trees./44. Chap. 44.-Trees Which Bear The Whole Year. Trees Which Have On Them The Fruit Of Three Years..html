TREES WHICHHAVE ON THEM THE FRUIT OF THREE YEARS.</head><p>The citron-tree,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> the juniper, and the holm-oak are lookedupon as having fruit on them the whole year through, andupon these trees we see the new fruit hanging along with thatof the preceding year. The pine, however, is the most remarkable of them all; for it has upon it at the same momentthe fruit that is hastening to maturity, the fruit that is tocome to maturity in the ensuing year, and the fruit that is toripen the next year but one.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> Indeed, there is no tree thatis more eager to develope its resources; for in the same monthin which a nut is plucked from it, another will ripen in thesame place; the arrangement being such, that there is nomonth in which the nuts of this tree are not ripening. Thosenuts which split while still upon the tree, are known by thename of azani¾;<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> they are productive of injury to the others,if not removed.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xii. c. 7.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This supposed marvel merely arises from the fact that the fruit has astrong ligneous stalk, which almost precludes the possibility of its dropping off.
