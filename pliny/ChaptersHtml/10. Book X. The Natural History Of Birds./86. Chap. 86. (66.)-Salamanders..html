This animal is so intensely cold as to extinguish fire by its contact, in the same way as ice does. It spitsforth a milky matter from its mouth; and whatever part ofthe human body is touched with this, all the hair falls off, andthe part assumes the appearance of leprosy.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ovid, Met.
