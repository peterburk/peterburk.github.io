The foundationof the town of Tibur, too, dates many years before that of theCity of Rome: there are three holm-oaks there, said to bemore ancient than Tiburnus even, who was the founder ofthat place; the tradition is that in their vicinity he was inaugurated. Tradition states also that he was a son of Amphiaraüs, who died before Thebes, one generation before the periodof the Trojan war.</p></div2></body>
