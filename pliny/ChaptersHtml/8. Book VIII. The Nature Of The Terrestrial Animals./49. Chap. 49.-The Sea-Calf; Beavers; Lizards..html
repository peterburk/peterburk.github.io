Theophrastus informs us, that lizards<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> also cast theirskins like the serpent, and instantly devour them, thus depriving us of a powerful remedy for epilepsy; he says, too,that the bite of the lizard is fatal in Greece, but harmless inItaly.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">As Cuvier remarks, it is impossible that any animal can discharge byvomiting what Pliny terms the "coagulum," which is the fourth stomachof a ruminant animal; the same substance which, under the name ofrennet, is employed to coagulate milk. He conjectures, that the error mayhave originated in the observation, that occasionally in fish, when suddenlydrawn out of the water, the air—Bladder is protruded from the mouth,which may have been mistaken for the stomach. The circumstance ismentioned by Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 23, and by Ælian, Anim.Nat. B. iii. c. 19, as well as the vomiting of the bile; respecting thislatter, we may remark, that vomiting is produced in various animals, whenunder the influence of extreme terror.—B.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The gecko, according to Littrè.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is incorrect; the bite of this animal, wherever found, is neverfatal.—B.</p></body>
