<div2 type="chapter" n="15" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 15.—SOME ACCOUNT OF THE TEETH, AND SOME FACTS CONCERNING INFANTS.</head><p>It is a matter beyond doubt, that in young children thefront teeth are produced at the seventh month, and, nearly always, those in the upper jaw the first. These are shed in theseventh year, and are then replaced by others.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> Some infantsare even born with teeth:<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> such was the case with ManiusCurius, who, from this circumstance, received the name ofDentatus; and also with Cn. Papirius Carbo, both of them distinguished men. When this phenomenon happened in the caseof a female, it was looked upon in the time of the kings as anomen of some inauspicious event. At the birth of Valeria,under such circumstances as these, it was the answer of the<pb n="2154" />soothsayers, that any city to which she might happen to becarried, would be destroyed; she was sent to Suessa Pometia,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>at that time a very flourishing place, but the prediction wasultimately verified by its destruction. Some female childrenare born with the sexual organs closed,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> a thing of very unfa-vourable omen; of which Cornelia, the mother of the Gracchi,is an instance. Some persons are born with a continuous bonein the mouth, in place of teeth; this was the case with theupper jaw of the son of Prusias, the king of Bithynia.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span></p><p>The teeth are the only parts of the body which resist theaction of fire, and are not consumed along with the rest of it.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>Still, however, though they are able thus to resist flame, theybecome corroded by a morbid state of the saliva. The teeth arewhitened by certain medicinal agents.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> They are worn downby use, and fail in some persons long before any other part ofthe body. They are necessary, not only for the mastication ofthe food, but for many other purposes as well. It is the officeof the front teeth to regulate the voice and the speech; by acertain arrangement, they receive, as if in concert, the strokecommunicated by the tongue, while by their structure in suchregular order, and their size, they cut short, moderate, or soften<pb n="2155" />the utterance of the words. When they are lost, the articulation becomes altogether confused and indistinct.<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span></p><p>In addition to this, it is generally supposed that we mayform prognostics from the teeth. The number of teeth allottedto all men, with the exception of the nation of the Turduli,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> isthirty-two; those persons who have a greater number, arethought to be destined to be long-lived. Women have fewerteeth than men.<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> Those females who happen to have two canineteeth on the right side of the upper jaw, have promise of beingthe favourites of fortune, as was the case with Agrippina,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>the mother of Domitius Nero: when they are on the left side,it is just the contrary. It is the custom of most nations notto burn the bodies of children who die before they have cuttheir teeth. We shall have more to say on this subject whenwe give an account of the different parts of the body.<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span></p><p>We find it stated that Zoroaster was the only human beingwho ever laughed on the same day on which he was born. Wehear, too, that his brain pulsated so strongly that it repelledthe hand when laid upon it, a presage of his future wisdom.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This account is correct, to the extent that the first teeth that appearare the two central incisors of the upper jaw; the next are the two lowercentral incisors, then the upper lateral incisors, the lower lateral incisors,and the upper and lower canines. The molars follow a different order, thelower ones appearing before the upper.—B.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hardouin mentions a number of authors who relate cases of thisnature. It is said to have taken place with our king Richard III. SeeShakespeare, Richard III., Act i. Scene 4. An individual of very differentcharacter and fortune, Louis XIV., is said to have been born with two teethin the upper jaw.—B.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A town of Latium we learn from Livy, B. i. c. 53, that it was captured and plundered by Tarquinius Superbus, but he makes no mention ofValeria. See B. iii. c. 9.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is stated by Seneca, De Consol. c. 16, that Cornelia survived a largefamily of children, all of whom were carried off early in life; of these thetwo celebrated Gracchi, Tiberius and Caius, met with violent deaths. Thepeculiarity here referred to, probably consisted in an imperforated hymen, amal-formation which not very unfrequently exists, and requires a surgicaloperation.—B.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This circumstance is mentioned by Val. Maximus, B. i. c. 8.—B. Welearn from Plutarch, that the same was the case also with Pyrrhus, king ofEpirus: Euryphæus also, the Cyrenian, and Euryptolemus, the king ofCyprus. Herodotus, B. ix., speaks of a skull found on the plain of Pla-tæa, with a similar conformation.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Although the teeth, and especially their enamel, form the most indestructible substance which enters into the composition of the body, it isnot absolutely so; a certain proportion of them consisting of animal matter, which is consumed, when exposed to a sufficient heat; the earthy partmay also be dissolved by the appropriate chemical re-agents.—B.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Powerful acids for instance; but they destroy the enamel. Lord Baconrecommends the ashes of tobacco as a whitener of the teeth; but that hasbeen found to have a similar effect.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We find in Haller, El. Phys. B. ix. c. 2, 4, 8, and in other physiologists, a minute account of the effects produced by the teeth in the articulation of the various letters which compose the alphabet.—B.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. iii. c. 3, and B. iv. c. 35. He does not say how many teeththe Turduli naturally had, but no doubt he is mistaken.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny repeats this statement in B. xi., c. 63, and extends it to thefemales of the sheep, goat, and hog. In the natural condition of the mouth,the number of the teeth is the same in both sexes; but, according to theobservations of Cuvier, what are called the "wisdom" teeth, though occasionally deficient in both sexes, are most frequently so in the female.—B.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He seems to allude to the younger Agrippina, the mother of the emperor Domitius Nero; neither her life, her character, nor her ultimatefate seem, however, to have entitled her to be called a favourite of Fortune.Her mother, the first Agrippina, grand-daughter of Augustus, appears, onthe other hand, to have been a woman of virtuous character, and spotlesschastity, without a vice, with the exception, perhaps, of ambition.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. x. c. 10.</p></body>
