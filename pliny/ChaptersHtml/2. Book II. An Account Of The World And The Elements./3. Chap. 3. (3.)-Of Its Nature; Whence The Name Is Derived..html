<div2 type="chapter" n="3" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 3. (3.)—OF ITS NATURE; WHENCE THE NAME IS DERIVED.</head><p>The rising and the setting of the sun clearly prove,that this globe is carried round in the space of twenty-fourhours, in an eternal and never-ceasing circuit, and with in-<pb n="1017" />credible swiftness<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>. I am not able to say, whether the soundcaused by the whirling about of so great a mass be excessive,and, therefore, far beyond what our ears can perceive, nor,indeed, whether the resounding of so many stars, all carriedalong at the same time and revolving in their orbits, maynot produce a kind of delightful harmony of incredible sweetness<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>. Tous, who are in the interior, the world appears toglide silently along, both by day and by night.</p><p>Various circumstances in nature prove to us, that thereare impressed on the heavens innumerable figures of animalsand of all kinds of objects, and that its surface is not perfectly polished like the eggs of birds, as some celebratedauthors assert<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>. For we find that the seeds of all bodies falldown from it, principally into the ocean, and, being mixedtogether, that a variety of monstrous forms are in this wayfrequently produced. And, indeed, this is evident to the eye;for, in one part, we have the figure of a wain, in another ofa bear, of a bull, and of a letter<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>; while, in the middle of them,over our heads, there is a white circle<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>.</p><p>(4.) With respect to the name, I am influenced by theunanimous opinions of all nations. For what the Greeks,from its being ornamented, have termed <foreign lang="greek">ko/smos,</foreign> we, from itsperfect and complete elegance, have termed <hi rend="ital">mundus.</hi> Thename <hi rend="ital">cœlum,</hi> no doubt, refers to its being engraven, as it<pb n="1018" />were, with the stars, as Varro suggests<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>. In confirmation ofthis idea we may adduce the Zodiac<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>, in which are twelvefigures of animals; through them it is that the sun has continued itscourse for so many ages.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See Ptolemy, <hi rend="ital">ubi supra.</hi></p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This opinion, which was maintained by Pythagoras, is noticed andderided by Aristotle, De Cœlo, lib. ii. cap. 9. p. 462–3.
