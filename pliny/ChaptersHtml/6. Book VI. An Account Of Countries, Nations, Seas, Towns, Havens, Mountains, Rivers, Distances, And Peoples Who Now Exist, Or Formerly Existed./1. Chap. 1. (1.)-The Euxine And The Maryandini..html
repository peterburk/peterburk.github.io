(1.)—THE EUXINE AND THE MARYANDINI.</head><p>THE Euxine<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> Sea, which in former times had the name ofAxenus,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> from the savage and inhospitable character of thenations living on its borders, by a peculiar whim of nature,which is continually giving way before the greedy inroads ofthe sea, lies between Europe and Asia. It was not enoughfor the ocean to have surrounded the earth, and then deprived us of a considerable portion of it, thus rendering stillgreater its uninhabitable proportion; it was not enoughfor it to have forced a passage through the mountains, tohave torn away Calpe from Africa, and to have swallowed upa much larger space than it left untouched; it was not enoughfor it to have poured its tide into the Propontis through theHellespont, after swallowing up still more of the dry land—for beyond the Bosporus, as well, it opens with its insatiateappetite upon another space of immense extent, until theMæotian lakes<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> unite their ravening waters with it as it ranges far and wide.</p><p>That all this has taken place in spite, as it were, of theearth, is manifested by the existence of so many straits andsuch numbers of narrow passages formed against the will of<pb n="2002" />Nature—that of the Hellespont,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> being only eight hundredand seventy-five paces in width, while at the two Bospori<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> thepassage across may be effected by oxen<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> swimming, a fact fromwhich they have both derived their name. And then besides,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>although they are thus severed, there are certain points onwhich these coasts stand in the relation of brotherhood towardseach other—the singing of birds and the barking of dogs onthe one side can be heard on the other, and an intercourse canbe maintained between these two worlds by the medium evenof the human voice,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> if the winds should not happen to carryaway the sound thereof.</p><p>The length of the borders of the Euxine from the Bosporusto the Lake Mæotis has been reckoned by some writers atfourteen hundred and thirty-eight miles; Eratosthenes, however, says that it is one hundred less. According to Agrippa,the distance from Chalcedon to the Phasis is one thousand miles,and from that river to the Cimmerian Bosporus three hundredand sixty. We will here give in a general form the distances asthey have been ascertained in our own times; for our arms haveeven penetrated to the very mouth of the Cimmerian Straits.</p><p>After passing the mouth of the Bosporus we come to theriver Rhebas,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> by some writers called the Rhesus. We nextcome to Psillis,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> the port of Calpas,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> and the Sagaris,<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> a famous<pb n="2003" />river, which rises in Phrygia and receives the waters of otherrivers of vast magnitude, among which are the Tembrogius<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>and the Gallus,<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> the last of which is by many called the Sangarius. After leaving the Sagaris the Gulf of the Mariandyni<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>begins, and we come to the town of Heraclea,<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> on the riverLycus;<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> this place is distant from the mouth of the Euxine twohundred miles. The sea-port of Acone<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> comes next, which hasa fearful notoriety for its aconite or wolf's-bane, a deadlypoison, and then the cavern of Acherusia,<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> the rivers Pædopides, Callichorus, and Sonautes, the town of Tium,<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> distant from Heraclea thirty-eight miles, and the river Billis.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or the "Hospitable" Sea, now the Black Sea.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or the "Inhospitable."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The streams which discharge their waters into the Palus Mæotis, orSea of Azof.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Straits of the Dardanelles or of Gallipoli, spoken of in B. iv. c. 18, as seven stadia in width.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Thracian Bosporus, now the Channel or Straits of Constantinople, and the Cimmerian Bosporus or Straits of Kaffa, or Yeni Kale.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From <foreign lang="greek">bou=s,</foreign> an ox, and<foreign lang="greek">poro/s,</foreign> "a passage."

The Cimmerian Bosporus not improbably borrowed its name from the Thracian. See Æsch. Prom.
