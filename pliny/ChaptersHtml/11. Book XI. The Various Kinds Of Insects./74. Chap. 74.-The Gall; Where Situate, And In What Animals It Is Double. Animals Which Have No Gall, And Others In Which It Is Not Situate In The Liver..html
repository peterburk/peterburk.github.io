ANIMALS WHICH HAVE NO GALL, AND OTHERSIN WHICH IT IS NOT SITUATE IN THE LIVER.</head><p>In the liver is the gall, which, however, does not exist inevery animal. At Chalcis, in Eubœa, none of the cattle haveit, while in the cattle of the Isle of Naxos, it is of extraordinary size, and double, so that to a stranger either of these factswould appear as good as a prodigy. The horse, the mule, theass, the stag, the roe-buck, the wild boar, the camel, and thedolphin have no gall, but some kinds of rats and mice have it.<pb n="3069" />Some few men are without it, and such persons enjoy robusthealth and a long life. There are some authors who say thatthe gall exists in the horse, not in the liver, but in the paunch,and that in the stag it is situate either in the tail or theintestines; and that hence it is, that those parts are so bitterthat dogs will not touch them. The gall, in fact, is nothingelse but the worst parts of the blood purged off, and for thisreason it is that it is so bitter: at all events, it is a well-knownfact, that no animal has a liver unless it has blood as well.The liver receives the blood from the heart, to which it isunited, and then disperses it in the veins.</p></div2></body>
