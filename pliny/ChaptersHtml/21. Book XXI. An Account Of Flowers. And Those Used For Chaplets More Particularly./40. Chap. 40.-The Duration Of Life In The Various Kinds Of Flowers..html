The rose-tree will last so long as five years without being pruned or cauterized,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> methods by which it is madeto grow young again. We have already stated<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> that the nature of the soil is of the very greatest importance; for inEgypt, we find, all these plants are perfectly inodorous, andit is only the myrtle that has any particular smell. In somecountries, too, the germination of all the plants precedes thatin other parts of the world by so long a period as two monthseven. The rose-beds should be well spaded immediately afterthe west winds begin to prevail, and, a second time, at thesummer solstice: every care, however, should be paid, betweenthese two periods, to keeping the ground well raked andcleaned.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See c. 38 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This method of cultivation, also mentioned by Theophrastus, is neveremployed in modern horticulture.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In c. 10 of this Book.</p></body>
