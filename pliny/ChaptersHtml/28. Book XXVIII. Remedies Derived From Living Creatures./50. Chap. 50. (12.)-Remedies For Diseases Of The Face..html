<div2 type="chapter" n="50" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 50. (12.)—REMEDIES FOR DISEASES OF THE FACE.</head><p>It is generally believed that asses' milk effaces wrinkles inthe face, renders the skin more delicate, and preserves its whiteness: and it is a well-known fact, that some women are in thehabit of washing their face with it seven<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> hundred times daily,strictly observing that number. Poppæa, the wife of theEmperor Nero, was the first to practise this; indeed, she hadsitting-baths, prepared solely with asses' milk, for which purpose whole troops of she-asses<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> used to attend her on her journies.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> Purulent eruptions on the face are removed by anapplication of butter, but white lead, mixed with the butter,is an improvement. Pure butter, alone, is used for serpiginous eruptions of the face, a layer of barley-meal being pow-dered over it. The caul of a cow that has just calved, isapplied, while still moist, to ulcers of the face.</p><p>The following recipe may seem frivolous, but still, to pleasethe women,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> it must not be omitted; the pastern-bone of awhite steer, they say, boiled forty days and forty nights, till it is<pb n="5341" />quite dissolved, and then applied to the face in a linen cloth,will remove wrinkles and preserve the whiteness of the skin.An application of bull's dung, they say, will impart a rosytint to the cheeks, and not crocodilea<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> even is better for thepurpose; the face, however, must be washed with cold water,both before and after the application. Sun-burns and all otherdiscolorations of the skin, are removed by the aid of' calves'dung kneaded up by hand with oil and gum; ulcerations andchaps of the mouth, by an application of veal or beef-suet,mixed with goose-grease and juice of' ocimum. There isanother composition, also, made of veal-suet with stag'smarrow and leaves of white-thorn, the whole beaten uptogether. Marrow, too, mixed with resin, even if it be cowmarrow only, is equally good; and the broth of cow-beef isproductive of similar effects. A most excellent remedy forlichens on the face is a glutinous substance prepared from thegenitals of a male calf, melted with vinegar and live sulphur,and stirred together with the branch of a fig-tree: this composition is applied twice a day, and should be used quite fresh.This glue, similarly prepared from a decoction of honey andvinegar, is a cure for leprous spots, which are also removed byapplying a he-goat's liver warm.</p><p>Elephantiasis, too, is removed by an application of goats'gall; and leprous spots and furfuraceous eruptions by em-ploying bull's gall with the addition of nitre, or else asses' urineabout the rising of the Dog-star. Spots on the face are removed by either bull's gall or ass's gall diluted in water byitself, care being taken to avoid the sun or wind after the skinhas peeled off. A similar effect is produced, also, by using bull'sgall or calf's gall, in combination with seed of cunila and theashes of a deer's horn, burnt at the rising of Canicula.</p><p>Asses' fat, in particular, restores the natural colour to scarsand spots on the skin caused by lichen or leprosy. A he-goat'sgall, mixed with cheese, live sulphur, and sponge reducedto ashes, effectually removes freckles, the composition beingbrought to the consistency of honey before being applied.Some persons, however, prefer using dried gall, and mix with itwarm bran, in the proportion of one obolus to four oboli of honey,the spots being rubbed briskly first. He-goat suet, too, is highly<pb n="5342" />efficacious, used in combination with gith, sulphur, and iris; thismixture being also employed, with goose-grease, stag's marrow,resin, and lime, for the cure of cracked lips. I find it statedby certain authors, that persons who have freckles on the skinare looked upon as disqualified from taking any part in thesacrifices prescribed by the magic art.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There surely must be a wrong reading here, or he cannot intend thisto be understood literally.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xi. c. 96.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">One of the mistresses of Louis XV. not only did this, but (in a spiritof great charity and consideration, of course) gave the milk to the poorafter she had thus used it.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Ad desideria mulierum."</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See c. 28 of this Book.</p></body>
