<div2 type="chapter" n="55" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 55.—THE MOST REMARKABLE WORKS IN SILVER, AND THENAMES OF THE MOST FAMOUS ARTISTS IN SILVER.</head><p>It is a remarkable fact that the art of chasing gold shouldhave conferred no celebrity upon any person, while that ofembossing silver has rendered many illustrious. The greatestrenown, however, has been acquired by Mentor, of whommention has been made already.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> Four pairs [of vases] wereall that were ever<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> made by him; and at the present day, notone of these, it is said, is any longer in existence, owing tothe conflagrations of the Temple of Diana at Ephesus and ofthat in the Capitol.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> Varro informs us in his writings that healso was in possession of a bronze statue, the work of thisartist. Next to Mentor, the most admired artists were Acra-<pb n="6139" />gas,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> Boëthus,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> and Mys.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> Works of all these artists are stillextant in the Isle of Rhodes; of Boëthus, in the Temple ofMinerva, at Lindus; of Acragas, in the Temple of FatherLiber, at Rhodes, consisting of cups engraved with figures inrelief of Centaurs and Bacchantes; and of Mys, in the sametemple, figures of Sileni and Cupids. Representations alsoof the chase by Acragas on drinking cups were held in highestimation.</p><p>Next to these in repute comes Calamis.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> Antipater<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> too, ithas been said, laid, rather than engraved,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> a Sleeping Satyrupon a drinking-bowl.<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> Next to these come Stratonicus<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> ofCyzicus, and Tauriscus:<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> Ariston<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> also, and Eunicus,<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> ofMytilene are highly praised; Hecatæus<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> also, and, about theage of Pompeius Magnus, Pasiteles,<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> Posidonius<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> of Ephesus,Hedystratides<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> who engraved battle-scenes and armed warriors,and Zopyrus,<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> who represented the Court of the Areopa-<pb n="6140" />gus and the trial of Orestes,<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> upon two cups valued at twelvethousand sesterces. There was Pytheas<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> also, a work ofwhose sold at the rate of ten thousand denarii for twoounces: it was a drinking-bowl, the figures on which representedUlysses and Diomedes stealing the Palladium.<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> Thesame artist engraved also, upon some small drinking-vessels,kitchen scenes,<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span> known as "magiriscia;"<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span> of such remarkablyfine workmanship and so liable to injury, that it was quiteimpossible to take copies<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span> of them. Teucer too, the inlayer,<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span>enjoyed a great reputation.</p><p>All at once, however, this art became so lost in point ofexcellence, that at the present day ancient specimens are theonly ones at all valued; and only those pieces of plate are heldin esteem the designs on which are so much worn that thefigures cannot be distinguished.</p><p>Silver becomes tainted by the contact of mineral waters,and of the salt exhalations from them, as in the interior ofSpain, for instance.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. vii. c. 39, and in Chapter 53 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Quatuor paria ab eo omnino facta sunt." Sillig, in his <hi rend="ital">Dictionaryof Ancient Artists,</hi> finds a difficulty in this passage. "The term 'omnino'seems to imply that the productions in question, all of which perished,were the <hi rend="ital">only</hi> works executed by this artist; but we find several passagesof ancient writers, in which vases, &amp;c. engraved by Mentor, are mentionedas extant. Thus, then, we must conclude, either that the term 'omnino'should be understood in the sense of 'chiefly,' 'pre-eminently,' or that theindividuals claiming to possess works of Mentor, were themselves misinformed,or endeavoured to deceive others." If, however, we look at theword "paria" in a strictly technical sense, the difficulty will probably beremoved. Pliny's meaning seems to be that Mentor made four <hi rend="ital">pairs,</hi> andno more, of some peculiar kind of vessel probably, and that all thesepairs were now lost. He does not say that Mentor did not make otherworks of art, in <hi rend="ital">single</hi> pieces. Thiersch, <hi rend="ital">Act. Acad. Monac.</hi> v. p. 128, expressesan opinion that the word "omnino" is a corruption and that init lies concealed the name of the kind of plate that is meant.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. vii. c. 39.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">His age and country are unknown.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From Pausanias we learn that he was a statuary and engraver onplate, born at Carthage; but Raoul Rochette thinks that he was a nativeof Chalcedon.
