<div2 type="chapter" n="3" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 3.—AT WHAT PERIOD THE ROMANS ACQUIRED SOME KNOW-LEDGE OF THIS SUBJECT.</head><p>The only<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> person among us, at least so far as I have been ableto ascertain, who had treated of this subject before the time ofValgius, was Pompeius Lenæus,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> the freedman of PompeiusMagnus; and it was in his day, I find, that this branch ofknowledge first began to be cultivated among us. Mithridates,the most powerful monarch of that period, and who was finallyconquered by Pompeius, is generally thought to have been a<pb n="5079" />more zealous promoter of discoveries for the benefit of mankind,than any of his predecessors—a fact evinced not only by manypositive proofs, but by universal report as well. It was hewho first thought, the proper precautions being duly taken, ofdrinking poison every day; it being his object, by becominghabituated to it, to neutralize its dangerous effects. Thisprince was the first discoverer too of the various kinds of antidotes, one<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> of which, indeed, still retains his name; and it isgenerally supposed that he was the first to employ the bloodof the ducks of Pontus as an ingredient in antidotes, from thecircumstance that they derive their nutriment from poisons.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span></p><p>It was to Mithridates that Asclepiades,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> that celebratedphysician, dedicated his works, still extant, and sent them, as asubstitute for his own personal attendance, when requested bythat monarch to leave Rome and reside at his court. It is awell-known fact, that this prince was the only person that wasever able to converse in so many as two-and-twenty languages,and that, during the whole fifty-six years of his reign, he neverrequired the services of an interpreter when conversing withany individuals of the numerous nations that were subject tohis sway.</p><p>Among the other gifts of extraordinary genius with whichhe was endowed, Mithridates displayed a peculiar fondness forenquiries into the medical arts; and gathering items of information from all his subjects, extended, as they were, over a largeproportion of the world, it was his habit to make copiesof their communications, and to take notes of the results whichupon experiment had been produced. These memoranda, whichhe kept in his private cabinet,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> fell into the hands of Pompeius,when he took possession of the royal treasures; who at oncecommissioned his freedman, Lenæus the grammarian, to translate them into the Latin language: the result of which was,that his victory was equally conducive to the benefit of therepublic and of mankind at large.<pb n="5080" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">With the exception of Cato, of course.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See end of B. xiv.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See c. 79 of this Book: also B. xxiii. c. 77, and B. xxix. c. 8.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A mere prejudice, arising from the fact that numerous poisonous plantsgrew in the countries on the shores of the Euxine.
