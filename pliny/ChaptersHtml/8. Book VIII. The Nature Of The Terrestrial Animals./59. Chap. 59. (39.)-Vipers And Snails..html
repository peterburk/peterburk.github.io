(39.)ÑVIPERS AND SNAILS.</head><p>It is said, that the viper is the only one among the serpentsthat conceals itself in the earth; the others lurking either inthe hollows of trees or in holes in the rocks.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> Provided theyare not destroyed by cold, they can live there, without takingfood, for a whole year.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> During the time that they are asleepin their retreat, none of them are venomous.</p><p>A similar state of torpor exists also in snails. These animalsagain become dormant during the summer, adhering verypowerfully to stones; and even, when turned up and pulledaway from the stones, they will not leave their shells. In theBalearic isles, the snails which are known as the cave-snail,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>do not leave their holes in the ground, nor do they feed uponany green thing, but adhere to each other like so many grapes.There is another less common species also, which is closed byan operculum that adheres to the shell.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> These animals always burrow under the earth, and were formerly never found,except in the environs of the Maritime Alps; they have, however, of late been dug up in the territory of Liternum;<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> the<pb n="2312" />most valued, however, of all, are those of the island of Astypal¾a.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This statement is contrary to the account given by Aristotle, Hist.Anim. B. viii. c. 15; he says, that while other serpents conceal themselvesin holes in the earth, vipers conceal themselves under rocks.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier remarks, Ajasson, vol. vi. p. 458, Lemaire, vol. iii. p. 473, thatnothing is more striking, either to the vulgar or to the man of science,than the long abstinence from food which serpents are capable ofenduring.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cavatica.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is the case with the Helix Pomatia, and still more so with theHelix Neritoidea, which is very common in the neighbourhood of Nice,and which, at the approach of winter, is furnished with an operculum ofgreat thickness.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. iii. c. 9.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. iv. c. 23. The Romans valued them as a delicate food.</p></body>
