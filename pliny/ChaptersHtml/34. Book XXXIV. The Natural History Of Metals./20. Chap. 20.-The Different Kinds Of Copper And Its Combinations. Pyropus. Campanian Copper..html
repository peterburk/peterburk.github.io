<div2 type="chapter" n="20" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 20.—THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF COPPER AND ITS COMBINATIONS.PYROPUS. CAMPANIAN COPPER.</head><p>We will now return to the different kinds of copper, and itsseveral combinations. In Cyprian copper we have the kindknown as "coronarium,"<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and that called "regulare,"<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> bothof them ductile. The former is made into thin leaves, and,after being coloured with ox-gall,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> is used for what has allthe appearance of gilding on the coronets worn upon the stage.The same substance, if mixed with gold, in the proportion ofsix scruples of gold to the ounce, and reduced into thin plates,acquires a fiery red colour, and is termed "pyropus."<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> Inother mines again, they prepare the kind known as "regulare,"as also that which is called "caldarium."<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> These differ fromeach other in this respect, that, in the latter, the metal is onlyfused, and breaks when struck with the hammer, whereas the"regulare" is malleable, or ductile,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> as some call it, a propertywhich belongs naturally to all the copper of Cyprus. In thecase, however, of all the other mines, this difference betweenbar copper and cast brass is produced by artificial means. All<pb n="6190" />the ores, in fact, will produce bar or malleable copper whensufficiently melted and purified by heat. Among the otherkinds of copper, the palm of excellence is awarded to that ofCampania,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> which is the most esteemed for vessels and utensils.This last is prepared several ways. At Capua it is meltedupon fires made with wood, and not coals, after which itis sprinkled with cold water and cleansed through a sievemade of oak. After being thus smelted a number of times,Spanish silver-lead is added to it, in the proportion of tenpounds of lead to one hundred pounds of copper; a methodby which it is rendered pliable, and made to assume that agreeablecolour which is imparted to other kinds of copper by theapplication of oil and the action of the sun. Many parts,however, of Italy, and the provinces, produce a similar kindof metal; but there they add only eight pounds of lead, and,in consequence of the scarcity of wood, melt it several timesover upon coals. It is in Gaul more particularly, where theore is melted between red-hot stones, that the difference is tobe seen that is produced by these variations in the method ofsmelting. Indeed, this last method scorches the metal, andrenders it black and friable. Besides, they only melt it twice;whereas, the oftener this operation is repeated, the better inquality it becomes.</p><p>(9.) It is also as well to remark that all copper fuses bestwhen the weather is intensely cold. The proper combinationfor making statues and tablets is as follows: the ore is firstmelted; after which there is added to the molten metal onethird part of second-hand<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> copper, or in other words, copperthat has been in use and bought up for the purpose. For itis a peculiarity of this metal that when it has been some timein use, and has been subject to long-continued friction, it becomesseasoned, and subdued, as it were, to a high polish.Twelve pounds and a half of silver-lead are then added toevery hundred pounds of the fused metal. There is also acombination of copper, of a most delicate nature, "mould-copper,"<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>as it is called; there being added to the metal one<pb n="6191" />tenth part of lead<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> and one twentieth of silver-lead, thiscombination being the best adapted for taking the colourknown as "Græcanicus."<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> The last kind is that known as"ollaria,"<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> from the vessels that are made of it: in thiscombination three or four pounds of silver-lead<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> are added toevery hundred pounds of copper. By the addition of lead toCyprian copper, the purple tint is produced that we see uponthe drapery of statues.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxxiii. c. 46.
