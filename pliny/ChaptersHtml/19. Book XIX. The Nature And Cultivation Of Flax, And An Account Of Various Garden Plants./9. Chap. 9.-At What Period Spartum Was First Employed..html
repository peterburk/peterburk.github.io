It seems to me very probable, too,that it was from them that the Carthaginians borrowed thefirst hint for applying spartum to a similar purpose.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The same word, <foreign lang="greek">sxoinos,</foreign> signifying both a "rush" and a "rope."</p></body>
