<div2 type="chapter" n="17" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 17. (13.)ÑBIRDS, THE RACE OF WHICH IS EXTINCT, OROF WHICH ALL KNOWLEDGE HAS BEEN LOST.</head><p>An inauspicious bird also is that known as the "incendiary;"<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span><pb n="2493" />on account of which, we find in the Annals, the City hashad to be repeatedly purified; as, for instance, in the consulship of L. Cassius and C. Marius,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> in which year also it waspurified, in consequence of a horned owl being seen. Whatkind of bird this incendiary bird was, we do not find stated,nor is it known by tradition. Some persons explain the termthis way; they say that the name "incendiary" was appliedto every bird that was seen carrying a burning coal fromthe pyre, or altar; while others, again, call such a bird a"spinturnix;<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> though I never yet found any person whosaid that he knew what kind of bird this spinturnix was.</p><p>(14.) I find also that the people of our time are ignorantwhat bird it was that was called by the ancients a "clivia."Some persons say that it was a clamatory, others, again, that itwas a prohibitory, bird. We also find a bird mentionedby Nigidius as the "subis," which breaks the eggs of theeagle.</p><p>(15.) In addition to the above, there are many other kindsthat are described in the Etruscan ritual, but which no one nowliving has ever seen. It is surprising that these birds are nolonger in existence, since we find that even those kinds abound,among which the gluttony of man commits such ravages.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier suggests, that it may be the coracias of Aristotle, our jack-daw probably, the Corvus graculus of Linn¾us. It has been said, that inits admiration of shining objects, it will take up a burning coal; a trickwhich has before now caused conflagrations. Servius speaks of it as frequenting funeral piles.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A.U.C. 647.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Spinturnix" and "clivia" were names given by the augurs probablyto some kinds of birds.</p></body>
