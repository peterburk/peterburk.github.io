<div2 type="chapter" n="65" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 65. (65.)—WHETHER THERE BE ANTIPODES?</head><p>On this point there is a great contest between the learned<pb n="1095" />and the vulgar. We maintain, that there are men dispersedover every part of the earth, that they stand with their feetturned towards each other, that the vault of the heavens appears alike to all of them, and that they, all of them, appear totread equally on the middle of the earth. If any one shouldask, why those situated opposite to us do not fall, we directlyask in return, whether those on the opposite side do notwonder that we do not fall. But I may make a remark, thatwill appear plausible even to the most unlearned, that if theearth were of the figure of an unequal globe, like the seed of apine<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>, still it may be inhabited in every part.</p><p>But of how little moment is this, when we have anothermiracle rising up to our notice! The earth itself is pendentand does not fall with us; it is doubtful whether this be fromthe force of the spirit which is contained in the universe<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>, orwhether it would fall, did not nature resist, by allowing ofno place where it might fall. For as the seat of fire is nowhere butin fire, nor of water except in water, nor of airexcept in air, so there is no situation for the earth except initself, everything else repelling it. It is indeed wonderfulthat it should form a globe, when there is so much flat surface ofthe sea and of the plains. And this was the opinionof Dicæarchus, a peculiarly learned man, who measured theheights of mountains, under the direction of the kings, andestimated Pelion, which was the highest, at 1250 paces perpendicular, and considered this as not affecting the roundfigure of the globe. But this appears to me to be doubtful,as I well know that the summits of some of the Alps riseup by a long space of not less than 50,000 paces<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>. But what<pb n="1096" />the vulgar most strenuously contend against is, to be compelled to believe that the water is forced into a roundedfigure<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>; yet there is nothing more obvious to the sight amongthe phænomena of nature. For we see everywhere, thatdrops, when they hang down, assume the form of small globes,and when they are covered with dust, or have the down ofleaves spread over them, they are observed to be completelyround; and when a cup is filled, the liquid swells up in themiddle. But on account of the subtile nature of the fluidand its inherent softness, the fact is more easily ascertainedby our reason than by our sight. And it is even morewonderful, that if a very little fluid only be added to a cupwhen it is full, the superfluous quantity runs over, whereasthe contrary happens if we add a solid body, even as muchas would weigh 20 denarii. The reason of this is, that whatis dropt in raises up the fluid at the top, while what is pouredon it slides off from the projecting surface. It is fromthe same cause<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> that the land is not visible from the bodyof a ship when it may be seen from the mast; and thatwhen a vessel is receding, if any bright object be fixed to themast, it seems gradually to descend and finally to becomeinvisible. And the ocean, which we admit to be withoutlimits, if it had any other figure, could it cohere and existwithout falling, there being no external margin to containit? And the same wonder still recurs, how is it that theextreme parts of the sea, although it be in the form of aglobe, do not fall down? In opposition to which doctrine,the Greeks, to their great joy and glory, were the first toteach us, by their subtile geometry, that this could not happen, even if the seas were flat, and of the figure which theyappear to be. For since water always runs from a higher to<pb n="1097" />a lower level, and this is admitted to be essential to it, noone ever doubted that the water would accumulate on anyshore, as much as its slope would allow it. It is also certain,that the lower anything is, so much the nearer is it to thecentre, and that all the lines which are drawn from this pointto the water which is the nearest to it, are shorter than thosewhich reach from the beginning of the sea to its extremeparts<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>. Hence it follows, that all the water, from every part,tends towards the centre, and, because it has this tendency,does not fall.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">As our author admits of the existence of antipodes, and expresslystates that the earth is a perfect sphere, we may conclude that theresemblance to the cone of the pine is to be taken in a very generalsense.How far the ancients entertained correct opinions respecting the globularfigure of the earth, or rather, at what period this opinion became generallyadmitted, it is perhaps not easy to ascertain. The lines in the Georgics,i. 242, 243, which may be supposed to express the popular opinion in thetime of Virgil, certainly do not convey the idea of a sphere capable ofbeing inhabited in all its parts:<lb />Hic vertex nobis semper sublimis; at illum<lb />Sub pedibus Styx atra videt, manesque profundi.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"spiritus vis mundo inclusi."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">".....Alpium vertices, iongo tractu, nee breviore quinquagintamillibus passuum assurgere." To avoid the apparent improbability of theauthor conceiving of the Alps as 50 miles high, the commentators have,according to their usual custom, exercised their ingenuity in altering thetext. See Poinsinet, i. 206, 207, and Lemaire, i. 373. But the expression does not imply that he conceived them as 50 miles in perpendicularheight, but that there is a continuous ascent of 50 miles to get to thesummit. This explanation of the passage is adopted by Alexandre; Lemaire,<hi rend="ital">ut supra.</hi> For what is known of Dicæarchus I may refer to Hardouin,Index Auctorum, in Lemaire, i. 181.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"coactam in verticem aquarum quoque figuram."</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"aqunrum nempe convexitas." Alexandre, in Lemaire, i. 374.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Quam quæ ad extremum mare a primis aquis." I profess myselfaltogether unable to follow the author's mode of reasoning in thisparagraph, or to throw any light upon it. He would appear to bearguingin favour of the actual flatness of the surface of the ocean, whereas hisprevious remarks prove its convexity.</p></body>
