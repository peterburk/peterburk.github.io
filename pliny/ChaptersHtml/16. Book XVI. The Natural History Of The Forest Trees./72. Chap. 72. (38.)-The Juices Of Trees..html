<div2 type="chapter" n="72" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 72. (38.)ÑTHE JUICES OF TREES.</head><p>There is a juice in the bark of trees, which must be lookedupon as their blood, though it is not of a similar nature in all.In the fig it is of a milky consistency, and has the peculiarproperty of curdling milk, and so forming cheese.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> In thecherry-tree this juice is gummy, in the elm clammy, in theapple viscous and fatty, while in the vine and the pear it iswatery. The more viscous this humour is, the more long-lived the tree. In a word, we find in the bodies of trees-aswith all other beings that are animated-skin, blood, flesh,sinews, veins, bones, and marrow; the bark serving them inplace of skin. It is a singular fact connected with the mulberry-tree, that when the medical men wish to extract its juice,if the incision is lightly made, by a blow with a stone, and atthe second hour of the day in spring, the juice will flow: butif, on the other hand, a wound is inflicted to any depth, it hasall the, appearance of being dried up.</p><p>Immediately beneath the bark in most trees there is a fattysubstance, which, from its colour, has obtained the name ofalburnum:<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> it is soft, and is the very worst part of the wood,<pb n="3413" />and in the robur even will very easily rot, being particularlyliable to wood-worm, for which reason it is invariably removed.Beneath this fat lies the flesh<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> of the tree, and then underthat, its bones, or, in other words, the choicest part of the wood.Those trees which have a dry wood, the olive, for instance,bear fruit every other year only: this is more the case withthem than with those the wood of which is of a fleshy nature,such as the cherry, for instance. It is not all trees, too, thathave this fat and flesh in any abundance, the same as we findto be the case among the more active animals. The box, thecornel, and the olive have none at all, nor yet any marrow, anda very small proportion, too, of blood. In the same way, too,the service-tree has no bones, and the elder no flesh, whileboth of them have marrow in the greatest abundance. Reeds,too, have hardly any flesh.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Though the acid it contains would curdle milk, still its naturalacridity would disqualify it from being used for making cheese.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The white sap or inner bark; the aubier of the French.
