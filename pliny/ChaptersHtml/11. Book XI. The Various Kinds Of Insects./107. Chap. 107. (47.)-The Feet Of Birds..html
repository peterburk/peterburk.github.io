<div2 type="chapter" n="107" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 107. (47.)—THE FEET OF BIRDS.</head><p>Among birds, some have the feet divided into toes, whileothers, again, are broad and flatfooted—in others, which partake of the intermediate nature of both, the toes are divided,with a wide space between them. All birds, however, havefour toes—three in front, and one on the heel; this last, however, is wanting in some that have long legs. The iynx<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> isthe only bird that has two toes on each side of the leg. Thisbird also protrudes a long tongue similar to that of the serpent,and it can turn the neck quite round and look backwards; ithas great talons, too, like those of the jackdaw. Some of theheavier birds have spurs also upon the legs; but none ofthose have them which have crooked talons as well. Thelong-footed birds, as they fly, extend the legs towards the tail,while those that have short legs hold them contracted close tothe middle of the body. Those authors who deny that thereis any bird without feet, assert that those even which arecalled apodes,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> are not without them, as also the oce, and thedrepanis,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> which last is a bird but very rarely seen. Serpents, too, have been seen with feet like those of the goose.<pb n="3091" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or wryneck.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. x. c. 5.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Supposed to be the Hirundo apns of Linnæus.
