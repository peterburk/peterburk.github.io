(79.)—OF EARTHQUAKES.</head><p>According to the doctrine of the Babylonians, earthquakesand clefts of the earth, and occurrences of this kind, aresupposed to be produced by the influence of the stars,especially of the three to which they ascribe thunder<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>; andto be caused by the stars moving with the sun, or being inconjunction with it, and, more particularly, when they arein the quartile aspect<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>. If we are to credit the report, a<pb n="1112" />most admirable and immortal spirit, as it were of a divinenature, should be ascribed to Anaximander the Milesian,who, they say, warned the Lacedæmonians to beware of theircity and their houses<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>. For he predicted that an earthquakewas at hand, when both the whole of their city was destroyedand a large portion of Mount Taygetus, which projected inthe form of a ship, was broken off, and added farther ruin tothe previous destruction. Another prediction is ascribed toPherecydes, the master of Pythagoras, and this was divine;by a draught of water from a well, he foresaw and predictedthat there would be an earthquake in that place<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>. And ifthese things be true, how nearly do these individuals approach to theDeity, even during their lifetime! But Ileave every one to judge of these matters as he pleases. Icertainly conceive the winds to be the cause of earthquakes;for the earth never trembles except when the sea is quitecalm, and when the heavens are so tranquil that the birdscannot maintain their flight, all the air which should supportthem being withdrawn<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>; nor does it ever happen until aftergreat winds, the gust being pent up, as it were, in thefissures and concealed hollows. For the trembling of theearth resembles thunder in the clouds; nor does the yawningof the earth differ from the bursting of the lightning; theenclosed air struggling and striving to escape<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Saturn, Jupiter and Mars: see the 8th chapter of this book.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Vel quando meant cum Sole in conjunctione cum eo, vel quandocum eo conveniunt in aspectu, maxime vero in quadrato, qui fit, qunmdistant a Sole quarta mundi sive cœli parte."

The phænomena ofearthquakes are described by Aristotle, De Mundo, cap. 4, and Meteor.ii. 7 and 8; also by Seneca in various parts of the 6th book of hisQusest. Nat.</p></body>
