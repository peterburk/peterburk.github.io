Ourfirst attention is justly due to Man, for whose sake all otherthings appear to have been produced by Nature; though, onthe other hand, with so great and so severe penalties for theenjoyment of her bounteous gifts, that it is far from easy todetermine, whether she has proved to him a kind parent, or amerciless step-mother.</p><p>In the first place, she obliges him alone, of all animatedbeings, to clothe himself with the spoils of the others; while, toall the rest, she has given various kinds of coverings, such asshells, crusts, spines, hides, furs, bristles, hair, down, feathers,scales, and fleeces.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> The very trunks of the trees even, she hasprotected against the effects of heat and cold by a bark, whichis, in some cases, twofold.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> Man alone, at the very moment of<pb n="2118" />his birth cast naked upon the laked earth,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> does she abandonto cries, to lamentations, and, a thing that is the case with noother animal whatever, to tears: this, too, from the very moment that he enters upon existence.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> But as for laughter,why, by Hercules!—to laugh, if but for an instant only, hasnever been granted to man before the fortieth day<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> from hisbirth, and then it is looked upon as a miracle of precocity.Introduced thus to the light, man has fetters and swathingsinstantly put upon all his limbs,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> a thing that falls to the lotof none of the brutes even that are born among us. Born tosuch singular good fortune,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> there lies the animal, which isdestined to command all the others, lies, fast bound hand andfoot, and weeping aloud! such being the penalty which hehas to pay on beginning life, and that for the sole fault ofhaving been born. Alas! for the folly of those who can thinkafter such a beginning as this, that they have been born for thedisplay of vanity!</p><p>The earliest presage of future strength, the earliest bountyof time, confers upon him nought but the resemblance to aquadruped.<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> How soon does man gain the power of walking?How soon does he gain the faculty of speech? How soon is hismouth fitted for mastication? How long are the pulsations ofthe crown of his head to proclaim him the weakest of all ani-<pb n="2119" />mated beings?<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> And then, the diseases to which he is subject,the numerous remedies which he is obliged to devise againsthis maladies, and those thwarted every now and then by newforms and features of disease.<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> While other animals havean instinctive knowledge of their natural powers; some, oftheir swiftness of pace, some of their rapidity of flight, andsome again of their power of swimming; man is the only onethat knows nothing, that can learn nothing without beingtaught; he can neither speak, nor walk, nor eat,<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> and, inshort, he can do nothing, at the prompting of nature only, butweep. For this it is, that many have been of opinion, that itwere better not to have been born, or if born, to have been annihilated<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> at the earliest possible moment.</p><p>To man alone, of all animated beings, has it been given, togrieve,<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> to him alone to be guilty of luxury and excess; andthat in modes innumerable, and in every part of his body.Man is the only being that is a prey to ambition, to avarice, to<pb n="2120" />an immoderate desire of life,<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> to superstition,<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span>—he is the onlyone that troubles himself about his burial, and even what is tobecome of him after death.<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> By none is life held on a tenuremore frail;<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> none are more influenced by unbridled desires forall things; none are sensible of fears more bewildering; noneare actuated by rage more frantic and violent. Other animals,in fine, live at peace with those of their own kind; we onlysee them unite to make a stand against those of a differentspecies. The fierceness of the lion is not expended in fighting with its own kind; the sting of the serpent is not aimedat the serpent;<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> and the monsters of the sea even, and thefishes, vent their rage only on those of a different species. Butwith man,—by Hercules! most of <hi rend="ital">his</hi> misfortunes are occasionedby man.<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span></p><p>(1.) We have already given<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> a general description of thehuman race in our account of the different nations. Nor, indeed, do I now propose to treat of their manners and customs,which are of infinite variety and almost as numerous as the variousgroups themselves, into which mankind is divided; but yetthere are some things, which, I think, ought not to be omitted;<pb n="2121" />and more particularly, in relation to those peoples which dwellat a considerable distance from the sea;<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> among which, Ihave no doubt, that some facts will appear of an astoundingnature, and, indeed, incredible to many. Who, for instance,could ever believe in the existence of the Æthiopians, whohad not first seen them? Indeed what is there that does not appear marvellous, when it comes to our knowledge for the firsttime?<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span> How many things, too, are looked upon as quite impossible, until they have been actually effected?<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span> But it isthe fact, that every moment of our existence we are distrusting the power and the majesty of Nature, if the mind, insteadof grasping her in her entirety, considers her only in detail.Not to speak of peacocks, the spotted skins of tigers and panthers, and the rich colours of so many animals, a trifling thingapparently to speak of, but of inestimable importance, whenwe give it due consideration, is the existence of so many languages among the various nations, so many modes of speech,so great a variety of expressions; that to another, a man whois of a different country, is almost the same as no man at all.<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span>And then, too, the human features and countenance, althoughcomposed of but some ten parts or little more, are so fashioned,that among so many thousands of men, there are no two inexistence who cannot be distinguished from one another, aresult which no art could possibly have produced, when confined to so limited a number of combinations. In most points,however, of this nature, I shall not be content to pledge myown credit only, but shall confirm it in preference by referringto my authorities, which shall be given on all subjects of anature to inspire doubt. My readers, however, must make noobjection to following the Greeks, who have proved them-<pb n="2122" />selves the most careful observers, as well as of the longeststanding.<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This remark refers to the five preceding books, in which these subjects have been treated in detail.—B.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We have a similar remark in Cicero, De. Nat. Deor. ii. 47.—B.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ajasson remarks, that trees have two barks, an outer, and an inner andthinner one; but seems to think that by the word "gemino" here, Plinyonly means that the bark of trees is sometimes double its ordinarythickness.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It seems to have been the custom among the ancients to place the newborn child upon the ground immediately after its birth.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny appears to have followed Lucretius in this gloomy view of thecommencement of human existence. See B. v. 1. 223, <hi rend="ital">et seq.</hi></p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This term of forty days is mentioned by Aristotle, in his NaturalHistory, as also by some modern physiologists.—B.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We may hence conclude, that the practice of swathing young infantsin tight bandages prevailed at Rome, in the time of Pliny, as it still doesin France, and many parts of the continent; although it has, for someyears, been generally discontinued in this country. Buffon warmly condemned this injurious system, eighty years ago, but without effect.—B.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Feliciter natus;" this appears so inconsistent with what is stated inthe text, that it has been proposed to alter it into <hi rend="ital">infeliciter,</hi> althoughagainst the authority of all the MSS.; but it may be supposed, thatPliny, as is not unusual with him, employs the term ironically.—B.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This reminds us of the terms of the riddle proposed to Œdipus bythe Sphinx: "What being is that, which, with four feet, has two feet andthree feet, and only one voice; but its feet vary, and where it has most it isweakest?" to which he answered, That it is man, who is a quadruped(going on feet and hands) in childhood, two-footed in manhood, andmoving with the aid of a staff in old age.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He alludes to the gradual induration of the bones of the head whichtakes place in the young of the human species, and imparts strength to it.Aristotle, in his Hist. Anim., states the general opinion of the ancients,that this takes place with the young of no other class of animated beings.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There is little doubt that new forms and features of disease are continually making their appearance among mankind, and even the samepeoples, and have been from the earliest period; it was so at Rome, in thedays of the Republic and of the Emperors. It is not improbable that thesenew forms of disease depend greatly upon changes in the temperature anddiet. The plagues of <date value="1348" authname="1348">1348</date>, <date value="1666" authname="1666">1666</date>, and the Asiatic cholera of the presentday, are not improbably various features of what may be radically the samedisease. At the first period the beverage of the English was beer, orrather sweet-wort, as the hop does not appear to have been used till alater period. At the present day, tea and coffee, supported by ardentspirits, form the almost universal beverage.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny forgets, however, that infants do <hi rend="ital">not</hi> require to be taught howto suck.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">According to Cicero, this opinion was more particularly expressed bySilenus and Euripides. Seneca also, in his Consolation to Marcia, expresses a very similar opinion. It was a very common saying, that "Thosewhom the gods love, die young." It will be observed that Pliny hereuses the significant word "aboleri," implying utter annihilation afterdeath. It will be seen towards the end of this Book, that he laughed toscorn the notion of the immortality of the soul.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">By the use of the word "luctus" he may probably mean "tears;"but there is little doubt that all animals have their full share of sorrows,brought upon them either by the tyranny and cruelty of man, or their ownunrestrained passions.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is said hyperbolically by Pliny. The brutes of the field have asstrong a love of life as man, although they may not be in fear of death, notknowing what it is. That they know what pain is, is evident fromtheir instinctive attempts to avoid it.</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Under this name he evidently intends to include all systems of religion, which he held in equal contempt.</p><p><span id="note_17"><a href="#ref_17">17. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ajasson seems to think that he alludes to man's craving desire forposthumous fame; but it is pretty clear that he has in view the then prevalent notions of the life of the soul after the death of the body.</p><p><span id="note_18"><a href="#ref_18">18. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pascal has a similar thought; he says that "Man is a reed, and theweakest reed of nature." The machinery of his body is minute and complex in the extreme, but it can hardly be said that his life is exposed to asmany dangers dependent on the volition of, or on accidents arising from,other animated beings, as that of minute insects.</p><p><span id="note_19"><a href="#ref_19">19. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ajasson refers to various classical authors for a similar statement,It is scarcely necessary to remark, that it is contrary to many well-knownfacts.—B. The cravings of hunger and of the sexual appetite, are quitesufficient to preclude the possibility of such a happy state of things amongthe brutes as Pliny here describes.</p><p><span id="note_20"><a href="#ref_20">20. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It was this feeling that prompted the common saying among the ancients, "Homo homini lupus"—"Man to man is a wolf;" and most trueit is, that"Man's inhumanity to man makes countless thousands mourn."</p><p><span id="note_21"><a href="#ref_21">21. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He alludes to the description already given in his geographicalBooks, of man taken in the aggregate, and grouped into nations.</p><p><span id="note_22"><a href="#ref_22">22. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">These are less known, as being less easy of access to travellers, andit is accordingly in connection with these, that we always meet with themost wonderful tales.—B.</p><p><span id="note_23"><a href="#ref_23">23. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This feeling is well expressed in the old and hackneyedadage, "Omneignotum pro mirifico"—"Everything that is unknown is taken for mar-vellous."</p><p><span id="note_24"><a href="#ref_24">24. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier remarks, that Pliny generally employs this kind of oratoricallanguage when he is entering upon a part of his work in which he betrays a peculiar degree of credulity, and a total want of correct judgmenton physical topics.—B.</p><p><span id="note_25"><a href="#ref_25">25. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Being debarred from holding converse, the first great tie of sociality.</p><p><span id="note_26"><a href="#ref_26">26. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ajasson does not hesitate to style this remark, "ridiculum sane;"as every one knows that the Greeks were more noted for their lively imagination, than for the correctness of their observations.—B. Surely Ajasson must have forgotten the existence of such men as Aristotle and Theophrastus!</p></body>
