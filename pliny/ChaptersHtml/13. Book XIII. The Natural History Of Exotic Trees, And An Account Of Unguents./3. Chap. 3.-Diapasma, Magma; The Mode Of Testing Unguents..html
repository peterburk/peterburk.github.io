The lees<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> of unguents are known by the name of "magma.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> In all thesepreparations the most powerful perfume is the one that isadded the last of all. Unguents keep best in boxes of alabaster,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and perfumes<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> when mixed with oil, which conducesall the more to their durability the thicker it is, such as theoil of almonds, for instance. Unguents, too, improve with age;but the sun is apt to spoil them, for which reason they areusually stowed away in a shady place in vessels of lead.When their goodness is being tested, they are placed on theback of the hand, lest the heat of the palm, which is morefleshy, should have a bad effect upon them.<pb n="3167" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The diapasmata were dry, odoriferous powders, similar to those usedat the present day in sachets and scent-bags.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Fæcem unguenti."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This word is still used in pharmacy to denote the husks or residuarymatter left after the extraction of the juice.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxxvi. c. 12.
