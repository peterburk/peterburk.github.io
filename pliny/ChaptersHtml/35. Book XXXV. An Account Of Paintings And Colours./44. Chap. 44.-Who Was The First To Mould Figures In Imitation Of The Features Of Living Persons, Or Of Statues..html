It was he, in fact,who first made it his study to give a faithful likeness; forbefore his time, artists only thought how to make their portraitsas handsome as possible. The same artist, too, was thefirst who thought of making models for his statues; a methodwhich afterwards became so universally adopted, that therecould be neither figure nor statue made without its model inclay. Hence it would appear, that the art of modelling inclay is more ancient than that of moulding in bronze.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxxiv. c. 19.
