<div2 type="chapter" n="6" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 6. (5.)—OF ITALY.</head><p>Next comes Italy, and we begin with the Ligures<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>, after<pb n="1181" />whom we have Etruria, Umbria, Latium, where the mouths ofthe Tiber are situate, and Rome, the Capital of the world,sixteen miles distant from the sea. We then come to thecoasts of the Volsci and of Campania, and the districts ofPicenum, of Lucania, and of Bruttium, where Italy extendsthe farthest in a southerly direction, and projects into the[two] seas with the chain of the Alps<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>, which there formspretty nearly the shape of a crescent. Leaving Bruttiumwe come to the coast of [Magna] Græcia, then the Salentini,the Pediculi, the Apuli, the Peligni, the Frentani, the Marrucini,the Vestini, the Sabini, the Picentes, the Galli, theUmbri, the Tusci, the Veneti, the Carni, the Iapydes, theHistri, and the Liburni.</p><p>I am by no means unaware that I might be justly accusedof ingratitude and indolence, were I to describe thus brieflyand in so cursory a manner the land which is at once thefoster-child<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and the parent of all lands; chosen by theprovidence of the Gods to render even heaven itself more glorious<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>,to unite the scattered empires of the earth, to bestow apolish upon men's manners, to unite the discordant and uncouthdialects of so many different nations by the powerfulties of one common language, to confer the enjoyments ofdiscourse and of civilization upon mankind, to become, inshort, the mother-country of all nations of the Earth.</p><p>But how shall I commence this undertaking? So vast isthe number of celebrated places (what man living couldenumerate them all?), and so great the renown attachedto each individual nation and subject, that I feel myself quite<pb n="1182" />at a loss. The city of Rome alone, which forms a portionof it, a face well worthy of shoulders so beauteous, howlarge a work would it require for an appropriate description!And then too the coast of Campania, taken singly by itself!so blest with natural beauties and opulence, that it is evidentthat when nature formed it she took a delight in accumulatingall her blessings in a single spot—how am I to do justice toit? And then the climate, with its eternal freshness and soreplete with health and vitality, the sereneness of the weatherso enchanting, the fields so fertile, the hill sides so sunny,the thickets so free from every danger, the groves so cool andshady, the forests with a vegetation so varying and so luxuriant, thebreezes descending from so many a mountain, thefruitfulness of its grain, its vines, and its olives so transcendent;its flocks with fleeces so noble, its bulls with necks sosinewy, its lakes recurring in never-ending succession, itsnumerous rivers and springs which refresh it with their waterson every side, its seas so many in number, its havens and thebosom of its lands opening everywhere to the commerce ofall the world, and as it were eagerly stretching forth intothe very midst of the waves, for the purpose of aiding as itwere the endeavours of mortals!</p><p>For the present I forbear to speak of its genius, its manners, itsmen, and the nations whom it has conquered byeloquence and force of arms. The very Greeks themselves,a race fond in the extreme of expatiating on their own praises,have amply given judgment in its favour, when they namedbut a small part of it 'Magna Græcia<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>.' But we must becontent to do on this occasion as we have done in our description ofthe heavens; we must only touch upon some ofthese points, and take notice of but a few of its stars. Ionly beg my readers to bear in mind that I am thus hasten-<pb n="1183" />ing on for the purpose of giving a general description ofeverything that is known to exist throughout the whole earth.</p><p>I may premise by observing that this land very much resembles in shape an oak leaf, being much longer than it isbroad; towards the top it inclines to the left<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>, while it terminates in the form of an Amazonian buckler<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>, in which the spotat the central projection is the place called Cocinthos, while itsends forth two horns at the end of its crescent-shaped bays,Leucopetra on the right and Lacinium on the left. It extends inlength 1020 miles, if we measure from the foot ofthe Alps at Prætoria Augusta, through the city of Rome andCapua to the town of Rhegium, which is situate on theshoulder of the Peninsula, just at the bend of the neck as itwere. The distance would be much greater if measured toLacinium, but in that case the line, being drawn obliquely,would incline too much to one side. Its breadth is variable;being 410 miles between the two seas, the Lower and theUpper<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>, and the rivers Varus and Arsia<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>: at about the middle,and in the vicinity of the city of Rome, from the spot wherethe river Aternus<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> flows into the Adriatic sea, to the mouthof the Tiber, the distance is 136 miles, and a little less fromCastrum-novum on the Adriatic sea to Alsium<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> on the Tuscan;but in no place does it exceed 200 miles in breadth.<pb n="1184" />The circuit of the whole, from the Varus to the Arsia, is 3059miles<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>.</p><p>As to its distance from the countries that surround it-Istria and Liburnia are, in some places<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>, 100 miles from it,and Epirus and Illyricum 50; Africa is less than 200, as weare informed by M. Varro; Sardinia<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> is 120, Sicily 1 1/2, Corsicaless than 80, and Issa<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> 50. It extends into the two seastowards the southern parts of the heavens, or, to speak withmore minute exactness, between the sixth<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> hour and the firsthour of the winter solstice.</p><p>We will now describe its extent and its different cities;in doing which, it is necessary to premise, that we shall follow thearrangement of the late Emperor Augustus, andadopt the division which he made of the whole of Italy intoeleven districts; taking them, however, according to theirorder on the sea-line, as in so hurried a detail it would not bepossible otherwise to describe each city in juxtaposition withthe others in its vicinity. And for the same reason, in describingthe interior, I shall follow the alphabetical orderwhich has been adopted by that Emperor, pointing out thecolonies of which he has made mention in his enumeration.Nor is it a very easy task to trace their situation and origin;for, not to speak of others, the Ingaunian Ligurians have hadlands granted to them as many as thirty different times.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The modern names of these localities will form the subject of consideration when we proceed, in c. 7, to a more minute description ofItaly.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This passage is somewhat confused, and may possibly be in a corruptstate. He here speaks of the Apennine Alps. By the "lunata juga"he means the two promontories or capes, which extend east and westrespectively.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This seems to be the meaning of "alumna," and not "nurse" or"foster-mother," as Ajasson's translation has it. Pliny probablyimplies by this antithesis that Rome has been "twice blessed," inreceivingthe bounties of all nations of the world, and in being able to bestow acommensurate return. Compared with this idea, "at once the nurse andmother of the world" would be tame indeed!</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">By adding its deified emperors to the number of its divinities. Afterwhat Pliny has said in his Second Book, this looks very much like pureadulation.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "Great Greece." This is a poor and frivolous argument used byPliny in support of his laudations of Italy, seeing that in allprobability it was not the people of Greece who gave this name tocertain citiesfounded by Greek colonists on the Tarentine Gulf, in the south of Italy;but either the Italian tribes, who in their simplicity admired theirsplendour and magnificence, or else the colonists themselves, who, inusingthe name, showed that they clung with fondness to the remembrance oftheir mother-country; while at the same time the epithet betrayed somevanity and ostentation in wishing thus to show their superiority to thepeople of their mother-country.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The comparison of its shape to an oak leaf seems rather fanciful;more common-place observers have compared it to a boot: by the top(cacumen) he seems to mean the southern part of Calabria aboutBrundisium and Tarentum; which, to a person facing the south, wouldincline to the coast of Epirus on the left hand.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The 'Parma' or shield here alluded to, would be one shaped like acrescent, with the exception that the inner or concave side would beformed of two crescents, the extremities of which join at the centralprojection. He says that Cocinthos (now Capo di Stilo) would in suchcase form the central projection, while Lacinium (now Capo delle Colonne)would form the horn at the extreme right, and Leucopetra (now Capodell' Armi) the horn on the extreme left.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Tuscan or Etrurian sea, and the Adriatic.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Varus, as already mentioned, was in Gallia Narbonensis, while theArsia, now the Arsa, is a small river of Istria, which became the boundarybetween Italy and Illyricum, when Istria was annexed by order of Augustus to the former country. It flows into the Flanaticus Sinus, nowGolfo di Quarnero, on the eastern coast of Istria, beyond the town ofCastel Nuovo, formerly Nesactium.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now the Pescara.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Palo, a city on the coast of Etruria, eighteen miles from PortusAugusti, at the mouth of the Tiber.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This distance is overstated: the circuit is in reality about2500 miles.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">For instance, from Pola to Ravenna, and from Iadera to Ancona.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Sardinia is in no part nearer to Italy than 140 miles.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Issa, now Lissa, is an island of the Adriatic, off the coast ofLiburnia; it is not less than eighty miles distant from the nearestpart of the coast of Italy.</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">That is to say, the south, which was so called by the Romans: themeaning being that Italy extends in a south-easterly direction.</p></body>
