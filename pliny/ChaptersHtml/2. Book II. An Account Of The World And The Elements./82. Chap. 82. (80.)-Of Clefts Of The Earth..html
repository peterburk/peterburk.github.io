(80.)—OF CLEFTS OF THE EARTH.</head><p>The earth is shaken in various ways, and wonderful effectsare produced<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>; in one place the walls of cities being thrown<pb n="1113" />down, and in others swallowed up by a deep cleft<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>; some-times great masses of earth are heaped up, and rivers forcedout, sometimes even flame and hot springs<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>, and at othersthe course of rivers is turned. A terrible noise precedesand accompanies the shock<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>; sometimes a murmuring, likethe lowing of cattle, or like human voices, or the clashing ofarms. This depends on the substance which receives thesound, and the shape of the caverns or crevices throughwhich it issues; it being more shrill from a narrow opening,more hoarse from one that is curved, producing a loud reverberation from hard bodies, a sound like a boiling fluid<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> frommoist substances, fluctuating in stagnant water, and roaringwhen forced against solid bodies. There is, therefore, oftenthe sound without any motion. Nor is it a simple motion,but one that is tremulous and vibratory. The cleft some-times remains, displaying what it has swallowed up; some-times concealing it, the mouth being closed and the soilbeing brought over it, so that no vestige is left; the citybeing, as it were, devoured, and the tract of country engulfed.Maritime districts are more especially subject to shocks.Nor are mountainous tracts exempt from them; I have found,by my inquiries, that the Alps and the Apennines are fre-quently shaken. The shocks happen more frequently in theautumn and in the spring, as is the case also with thunder.There are seldom shocks in Gaul and in Egypt; in the latterit depends on the prevalence of summer, in the former, ofwinter. They also happen more frequently in the night thanin the day. The greatest shocks are in the morning and theevening; but they often take place at day-break, and some-times at noon. They also take place during eclipses of thesun and of the moon, because at that time storms are lulled.They are most frequent when great heat succeeds to showers,or showers succeed to great heat<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>.<pb n="1114" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">On this subject we shall find much curious matter in Aristotle'sTreatise de Mundo, cap. 4.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Poinsinet enters into a long detail of some of the most remarkableearthquakes that have occurred, from the age of Pliny to the period whenhe wrote, about fifty years ago; i. 249. 2.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See Aristotle, Meteor. ii. 8.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See Aristotle, Meteor. ii. 8, and Seneca, Nat.
