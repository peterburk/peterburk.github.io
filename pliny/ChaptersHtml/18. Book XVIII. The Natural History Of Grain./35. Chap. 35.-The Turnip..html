The more careful growers recommendthat the ground should be turned up five times before puttingin the turnip, and four for rape, care being taken, in bothcases, to manure it well. Rape, they say, will thrive all thebetter, if it is sown together with some chaff. They willhave it, too, that the sower ought to be stripped, and that heshould offer up a prayer while sowing, and say: "I sow thisfor myself and for my neighbours." The proper time for sowing both kinds is the period that intervenes between the festivals<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> of the two divinities, Neptune and Vulcan. It is said,too—and it is the result of very careful observation—thatthese plants will thrive wonderfully well, if they are sown asmany days after the festival of Neptune as the moon was oldwhen the first snow fell the previous winter. They are sownin spring as well, in warm and humid localities.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Brassica &lt;*&gt;apus of Linnæus.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">1st of March.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Neptunalia and the Vulcanalia; 23rd of July and 23rd ofAugust.</p></body>
