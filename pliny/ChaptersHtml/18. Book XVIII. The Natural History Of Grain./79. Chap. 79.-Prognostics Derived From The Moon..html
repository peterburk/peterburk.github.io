<div2 type="chapter" n="79" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 79.—PROGNOSTICS DERIVED FROM THE MOON.</head><p>The prognostics derived from the moon, assert their right tooccupy our notice in the second place. In Egypt, attention ispaid, more particularly, to the fourth day of the moon. If,when the moon rises, she shines with a pure bright light, it isgenerally supposed that we shall have fine weather; but if sheis red, there will be wind, and if of a swarthy<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> hue, rain. Ifupon the fifth day of the moon her horns are obtuse, they arealways indicative of rain, but if sharp and erect, of wind, andthis on the fourth day of the moon more particularly. If hernorthern horn is pointed and erect, it portends wind; and if itis the lower horn that presents this appearance, the wind willbe from the south; if both of them are erect, there will behigh winds in the night. If upon the fourth day of the moonshe is surrounded by a red circle, it is portentous of wind andrain.</p><p>In Varro we find it stated to the following effect:—"If, atthe fourth day of the moon, her horns are erect, there will begreat storms at sea, unless, indeed, she has a circlet<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> around her,and that circlet unblemished; for by that sign we are informedthat there will be no stormy weather before full moon. If, atthe full moon, one half of her disk is clear, it is indicative offine weather, but if it is red, of wind, and if black, of rain. Ifa darkness comes over the face of the moon, covered with clouds,in whatever quarter it breaks, from that quarter wind may beexpected. If a twofold circle surrounds the moon, the stormwill be more violent, and even more so still, if there are threecircles, or if they are black, broken, and disjointed. If the newmoon at her rising has the upper horn obscured, there will be aprevalence of rainy weather, when she is on the wane; but ifit is the lower horn that is obscured, there will be rain beforefull moon; if, again, the moon is darkened in the middle of herdisk, there will be rain when she is at full. If the moon, whenfull, has a circle round her, it indicates wind from the quarterin the circle which is the brightest; but if at her rising the<pb n="4120" />horns are obtuse, they are portentous of a frightful tempest.If, when the west wind prevails, the moon does not make herappearancè before her fourth day, there will be a prevalenceof stormy weather throughout the month. If on the sixteenthday the moon has a bright, flaming appearance, it is a presageof violent tempests."</p><p>There are eight different epochs of the moon, or periods atwhich she makes certain angles of incidence with the sun, andmost persons only notice the prognostics derived from themoon, according to the places which they occupy between theseangles. The periods of these angles are the third day, theseventh, the eleventh, the fifteenth, the nineteenth, thetwenty-third, the twenty-seventh, and that of the conjunction.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">So Virgil, Georg. i. 427.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Coronam.</p></body>
