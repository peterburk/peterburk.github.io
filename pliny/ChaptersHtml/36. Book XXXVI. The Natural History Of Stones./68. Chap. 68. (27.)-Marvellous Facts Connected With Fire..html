(27.)ÑMARVELLOUS FACTS CONNECTED WITH FIRE.</head><p>Having now described all the creations of human ingenuity,reproductions, in fact, of Nature by the agency of art, itcannot but recur to us, with a feeling of admiration, that thereis hardly any process which is not perfected through theintervention of fire. Submit to its action some sandy soil,and in one place it will yield glass, in another silver, inanother minium, and in others, again, lead and its severalvarieties, pigments, and numerous medicaments. It is throughthe agency of fire that stones<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> are melted into copper; by firethat iron is produced, and subdued to our purposes; by firethat gold is purified; by fire, too, that the stone is calcined,which is to hold together the walls of our houses.</p><p>Some materials, again, are all the better for being repeatedlysubmitted to the action of fire; and the same substance willyield one product at the first fusion, another at the second, andanother at the third.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> Charcoal, when it has passed through fireand has been quenched, only begins to assume its active properties;and, when it might be supposed to have been reducedto annihilation, it is then that it has its greatest energies. Anelement this, of immense, of boundless<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> power, and, as towhich, it is a matter of doubt whether it does not create evenmore than it destroys!</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxxiv. c. 2.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxxiv. c. 47.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Improba" seems to be used here in much the same sense in whichVirgil has said "Labor improbus"Ñ"Unremitting labour."</p></body>
