(13.)â€”THE METHODS OF TESTING PRECIOUS STONES.</head><p>On the contrary, we will make it our business to point outthe methods of detecting these false stones, seeing that it isonly proper to put luxury even on its guard against fraud.In addition to the particulars which we have already given,when treating of each individual kind of precious stone, it isgenerally agreed that transparent stones should be tested bya morning light, or even, if necessary, so late as the fourth<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>hour, but never after that hour. The modes of testing<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> stonesare numerous: first, by their weight, the genuine stone beingthe heavier of the two; next, by their comparative coolness,the genuine stone being cooler than the other to the mouth;and, next to that, by their substance; there being blisters perceptiblein the body of the fictitious stone, as well as a certainroughness on the surface; filaments, too, an unequal brilliancy,and a brightness that falls short before it reaches the eye.The best<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> mode of testing is to strike off a fragment withan iron saw; but this is a thing not allowed by thedealers, who equally refuse to let their gems be tested by thefile. Dust of Obsian<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> stone will not leave a mark upon thesurface of a genuine stone: but where the gem is artificial,<pb n="6464" />every mark that is made will leave a white scratch upon it.In addition to this, there is such a vast diversity in their degreesof hardness, that some stones do not admit of beingengraved with iron, and others can only be cut with a graverblunted at the edge. In all cases, however, precious stonesmay be cut and polished by the aid of adamas;<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> an operationwhich may be considerably expedited by heating the graver.The rivers which produce precious stones, are the Acesinus<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>and the Ganges; and, of all countries, India is the most prolificof them.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ten in the morning.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See Chapters 18 and 20.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We can only guess at the meaning of this passage, as it is acknowledgedly corrupt.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Our Obsidian.
