<div2 type="chapter" n="14" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 14.—SEED-PLOTS.</head><p>In laying out a seed-plot it is necessary that a soil of thevery highest quality should be selected; for it is very oftenrequisite that a nurse should be provided for the young plants,who is more ready to hamour them than their parent soil. Theground should therefore be both dry and nutritious, well<pb n="3465" />turned up with the mattock, replete with hospitality to thestranger plants, and as nearly as possible resembling the soil towhich it is intended they should be transplanted. But, athing that is of primary importance, the stones must be carefully gathered from off the ground, and it should be walled in,to ensure its protection from the depredations of poultry; thesoil too, should have as few chinks and crannies as possible,so that the sun may not be enabled to penetrate and burn upthe roots. The young trees should be planted at distances<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> ofa foot and a-half; for if they happen to touch one another, inaddition to other inconveniences, they are apt to breed worms;for which reason it is that they should be hoed as often aspossible, and all weeds pulled up, the young plants themselvesbeing carefully pruned, and so accustomed to the knife.</p><p>Cato<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> recommends, too, that hurdles should be set up uponforks, the height of a man, for the purpose of intercepting therays of the sun, and that they should be covered with strawto keep off the cold.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> He says that it is in this way that theseeds of the apple and the pear are reared, the pine-nut also,and the cypress,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> which is propagated from seed as well. Inthis last, the seed is remarkably<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> small, so much so, in fact, asto be scarcely perceptible. It is a marvellous fact, and one whichought not to be overlooked, that a tree should be producedfrom sources so minute, while the grains of wheat and ofbarley are so very much larger, not to mention the bean.What proportion, too, is there between the apple and thepear tree, and the seeds from which they take their rise? Itis from such beginnings, too, as these that springs the timberthat is proof against the blows of the hatchet, presses<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> thatweights of enormous size even are unable to bend, masts thatsupport the sails of ships, and battering-rams that are able to<pb n="3466" />shake even towers and walls! Such is the might, such is thepower that is displayed by Nature. But, a marvel that transcends all the rest, is the fact of a vegetable receiving its birthfrom a tear-like drop, as we shall have occasion to mention<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> inthe appropriate place.</p><p>To resume, however: the tiny balls which contain the seedare collected from the female cypress—for the male, as I havealready<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> stated, is barren. This is done in the months whichI have previously<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> mentioned, and they are then dried in thesun, upon which they soon burst, and the seed drops out,a substance of which the ants are remarkably fond; this fact,too, only serves to enhance the marvel, when we reflect thatan insect so minute is able to destroy the first germ of a treeof such gigantic dimensions. The seed is sown in the monthof April, the ground being first levelled with rollers, or elseby means of rammers;<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> after which the seed is thickly sown,and earth is spread upon it with a sieve, about a thumb deep.If laid beneath a considerable weight, the seed is unable tospring up, and is consequently thrown back again into theearth; for which reason it is often trodden only into theground. It is then lightly watered after sunset every threedays, that it may gradually imbibe the moisture until suchtime as it appears above ground. The young trees are transplanted at the end of a year, when about three-quarters of afoot in length, due care being taken to watch for a clear daywith no wind, such being the best suited for the process oftransplanting. It is a singular thing, but still it is a fact, thatif, on the day of transplanting, and only that day, there is theslightest drop of rain or the least breeze stirring, it is attendedwith danger<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> to the young trees; while for the future theyare quite safe from peril, though at the same time theyhave a great aversion to all humidity.<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> The jujube-tree<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> is<pb n="3467" />propagated from seed sown in the month of April. As to thetuber,<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> it is the best plan to graft it upon the wild plum, thequince, and the calabrix,<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> this last being the name that isgiven to a wild thorn. Every kind of thorn, too, will receivegrafts remarkably well from the myxa plum,<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> as well asfrom the sorb.</p><p>(11.) As to recommending transferring the young plants fromthe seed-plot to another spot before finally planting them out,I look upon it as advice that would only lead to so much unnecessary trouble, although it is most confidently urged that bythis process the leaves are sure to be considerably larger thanthey otherwise would.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The distance, in reality, ought to vary according to the nature andspecies of the trees, and the height they are to be allowed to attain.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">De Re Rust. 48.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">These precautions are not looked upon as necessary for the indigenoustrees at the present day.
