<div2 type="chapter" n="10" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 10.—OTHER PRODUCTIONS ON THESE TREES BESIDES THE ACORN.</head><p>The robur, in addition to its fruit, has a great number ofother productions: it bears<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> the two varieties of the gall-nut,<pb n="3351" />and a production which closely resembles the mulberry,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> except that it differs from it in being dry and hard: for the mostpart it bears a resemblance to a bull's head, and in the insidethere is a fruit very similar to the stone of the olive. Littleballs<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> also are found growing on the robur, not unlike nuts inappearance, and containing within them a kind of soft wool,which is used for burning in lamps; for it will keep burningwithout oil, which is the case also with the black gall-nut.It bears another kind, too, of little ball, covered with hair,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> butused for no purpose: in spring, however, this contains a juice likehoney. In the hollows formed by the union of the trunk andbranches of this tree there are found also small round balls,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>which adhere bodily to the bark, and not by means of a stalk:at the point of junction they are white, but the rest of thebody is spotted all over with black: inside they are of a scarletcolour, but on opening them they are found to be empty, andare of a bitter taste.</p><p>Sometimes, too, the robur bears a kind of pumice,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> as wellas little balls, which are formed of the leaves rolled up; uponthe veins of the leaves, too, there are watery pustules, of awhitish hue, and transparent while they are soft; in these akind of gnat<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> is produced, and they come to maturity just inthe same way that the ordinary gall-nut does.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The ancients were not aware that the gall was produced from the eggsof the cynips, deposited upon the leaf or bark of the tree. Tan and gallicacid are its principal component parts.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A substance quite unknown now; but it is very doubtful if Pliny isrightly informed here.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A fungous gall, produced by the Cynips fungosa. It is not used forany domestic purpose at the present day.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This kind of gall is now unknown. Fée questions the assertion aboutits juice.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Cynips quercus baccarum of Linnæus, one of the common galls.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The root cynips, the Cynips radicum of Fourcroi, produces thesegalls, which lie near the root, and have the appearance of ligneous nodo-sities. It is harder than wood, and contains cells, in which the larva of theinsect lies coiled up.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is a proof, as Fée remarks, that the ancients had observed theexistence of the cynips; though, at the same time, it is equally evidentthat they did not know the important part it acts in the formation of thegall.</p></body>
