Itis like amber in colour, and, if beaten up with palm-wine andsaffron, it will become soft like wax, yielding a very fragrantsmell. Zmilampis is found in the river Euphrates: it resemblesmarble of Proconnesus in appearance, and is of a seagreencolour within. Zoraniscæa is found in the river Indus:it is a stone used by magicians, it is said, but I find no furtherparticulars relative to it.</p></div2></body>
