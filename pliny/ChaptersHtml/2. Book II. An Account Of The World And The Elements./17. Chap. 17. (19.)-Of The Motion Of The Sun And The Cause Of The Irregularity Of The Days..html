<div2 type="chapter" n="17" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 17. (19.)ÑOF THE MOTION OF THE SUN AND THE CAUSEOF THE IRREGULARITY OF THE DAYS.</head><p>The Sun himself is in four different states; twice the night<pb n="1051" />is equal to the day, in the Spring and in the Autumn,when he is opposed to the centre of the earth<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>, in the 8thdegree of Aries and Libra<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>. The length of the day and thenight is then twice changed, when the day increases in length,from the winter solstice in the 8th degree of Capricorn, andafterwards, when the night increases in length from thesummer solstice in the 8th degree of Cancer<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>. The cause ofthis inequality is the obliquity of the zodiac, since there is,at every moment of time, an equal portion of the firmamentabove and below the horizon. But the signs which mountdirectly upwards, when they rise, retain the light for a longerspace, while those that are more oblique pass along morequickly.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"centrum terr¾;" the equator, the part equally distant from thetwo poles or extremities.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It may be remarked, that the equinoxes did not actually take placeat this period in the points mentioned by Pliny, but in the 28th degreesof Pisces and Virgo respectively; he appears to have conformed to thepopular opinion, as we may learn from Columella, lib. ix. cap. 14. Thedegrees mentioned above were those fixed by the Greek astronomers whoformed the celestial sphere, and which was about 138 years before theChristian ¾ra.
