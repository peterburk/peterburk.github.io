Strainsand contusions are healed with wild boars' dung, that has beengathered in spring and dried. A similar method is employedwhere persons have been dragged by a chariot or lacerated bythe wheels, or have received contusions in any other way, theapplication being quite as effectual, should the dung happento be fresh. Some think it a better plan, however, to boil itin vinegar; and if only powdered and taken in vinegar, theyvouch for its good effects where persons are ruptured, woundedinternally, or suffering from the effects of a fall.</p><p>Others again, who are of a more scrupulous tendency,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> takethe ashes of it in water; and the Emperor Nero, it is said, wasin the habit of refreshing himself with this drink, when he attempted to gain the public applause at the three-horse chariotraces.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> Swine's dung, it is generally thought, is the nextbest to that of the goat.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Where the sinew has been wounded and exposed, either vinegar orhoney, Ajasson remarks, would be a highly dangerous application.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Reverentiores."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Trigario"</p></body>
