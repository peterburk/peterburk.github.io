<div2 type="chapter" n="39" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 39.—THE TITHYMALOS CHARACIAS.</head><p>The tithymalos is called by our people the "milk plant,"<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>and by some persons the "goat lettuce."<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> They say, that ifcharacters are traced upon the body with the milky juice ofthis plant, and powdered with ashes, when dry, the letters willbe perfectly visible; an expedient which has been adoptedbefore now by intriguers, for the purpose of communicatingwith their mistresses, in preference to a correspondence byletter. There are numerous varieties of this plant.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> Thefirst kind has the additional name of "characias,"<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and isgenerally looked upon as the male plant. Its branches areabout a finger in thickness, red and full of juice, five or six innumber, and a cubit in length. The leaves near the root arealmost exactly those of the olive, and the extremity of thestem is surmounted with a tuft like that of the bulrush: it isfound growing in rugged localities near the sea-shore. Theseed is gathered in autumn, together with the tufts, and afterbeing dried in the sun, is beaten out and put by for keeping.<pb n="5178" />As to the juice, the moment the down begins to appearupon the fruit, the branches are broken off and the juice ofthem is received upon either meal of fitches or else figs, andleft to dry therewith. Five drops are as much as each figought to receive; and the story is, that if a dropsically patienteats one of these figs he will have as many motions as the fighas received drops. While the juice is being collected, duecare must be taken not to let it touch the eyes. From the leaves,pounded, a juice is also extracted, but not of so useful anature as the other kind: a decoction, too, is made from thebranches.</p><p>The seed also is used, being boiled with honey and made upinto purgative<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> pills. These seeds are sometimes inserted inhollow teeth with wax: the teeth are rinsed too, with a decoction of the root in wine or oil. The juice is used externallyfor lichens, and is taken internally both as an emetic and topromote alpine evacuation: in other respects, it is prejudicial tothe stomach. Taken in drink, with the addition of salt, it carries off pituitous humours; and in combination with saltpeter,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>removes bile. In cases where it is desirable that it should purgeby stool, it is taken with oxycrate, but where it is wantedto act as an emetic, with raisin wine or hydromel; three obolibeing a middling dose. The best method, however, of using it,is to eat the prepared figs above-mentioned, just after takingfood. In taste, it is slightly burning to the throat; indeed itis of so heating a nature, that, applied externally by itself, itraises blisters on the flesh, like those caused by the action offire. Hence it is that it is sometimes employed as a cautery.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Herba lactaria."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Because goats are fond of it.
