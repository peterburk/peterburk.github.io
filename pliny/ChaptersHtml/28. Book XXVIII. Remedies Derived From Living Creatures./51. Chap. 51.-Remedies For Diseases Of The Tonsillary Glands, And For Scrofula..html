<div2 type="chapter" n="51" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 51.—REMEDIES FOR DISEASES OF THE TONSILLARY GLANDS,AND FOR SCROFULA.</head><p>Cow's milk or goat's milk is good for ulcerations of thetonsillary glands and of the trachea. It is used in the form ofa gargle, warm from the udder or heated, goat's milk beingthe best, boiled with mallows and a little salt. A broth madefrom tripe is an excellent gargle for ulcerations of the tongue andtrachea; and for diseases of the tonsillary glands, the kidneys of afox are considered a sovereign remedy, dried and beaten up withhoney, and applied externally. For quinzy, bull's gall or goat'sgall is used, mixed with honey. A badger's liver, taken inwater, is good for offensive breath, and butter has a healingeffect upon ulcerations of the mouth. When a pointed orother substance has stuck in the throat, by rubbing it externally with cats' dung, the substance, they say, will either comeup again or pass downwards into the stomach.</p><p>Scrofulous sores are dispersed by applying the gall of a wildboar or of an ox, warmed for the purpose: but it is only when thesores are ulcerated that hare's rennet is used, applied in a linencloth with wine. The ashes of the burnt hoof of an ass orhorse, applied with oil or water, is good for dispersing scrofu-lous sores; warmed urine also; the ashes of an ox's hoof,taken in water; cow-dung, applied hot with vinegar; goat-suet with lime; goats' dung, boiled in vinegar; or the testesof a fox. Soap,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> too, is very useful for this purpose, aninvention of the Gauls for giving a reddish<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> tint to the hair.This substance is prepared from tallow and ashes, the best ashesfor the purpose being those of the beech and yoke-elm: thereare two kinds of it, the hard soap and the liquid, both of themmuch used by the people of Germany, the men, in particular,more than the women.<pb n="5343" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See Beckmann's <hi rend="ital">Hist.
