<div2 type="chapter" n="11" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 11.ÑTREES WHICH NEVER DEGENERATE.</head><p>On the other hand, there are some trees which have the property of never degenerating, in whatever manner they are reproduced, the cypress, palm, and laurel,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> for instance: for wefind that the laurel is capable of being propagated in severalways. We have already made mention<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> of the various kindsof laurel; those known as the Augustan, the baccalis, and thetinus<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> are all reproduced in a similar manner. The berriesare gathered in the month of January, after they have beendried by the north-east winds which then prevail; they arethen kept<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> separate and exposed to the action of the air, beingliable to ferment if left in a heap. After this, they are first<pb n="3462" />seasoned with smoke, and then steeped in urine, preparatoryto sowing.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> Some persons put them in baskets of osier, andtread them down with the feet in running water, until theouter skin is removed, as it is found that the moisture<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> whichthey contain is detrimental to them, and prevents them fromgerminating. A trench is then dug, about a palm in depth,and somewhere about twenty of the berries are then put intoit, being laid in a heap: this is usually done in the month ofMarch. These kinds of laurel admit of being propagatedfrom layers also; but the triumphal<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> laurel can be reproducedfrom cuttings only.</p><p>All the varieties of the myrtle<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> are produced in Campaniafrom the berry only, but at Rome from layers. Democritus,however, says that the Tarentine myrtle may be re-producedanother way.<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> They take the largest berries and pound themlightly so as not to crush the pips: with the paste that is thusmade a rope is covered, and put lengthwise in the ground;the result of which is that a hedge is formed as thick as a wall,with plenty of slips for transplanting. In the same way, too,they plant brambles to make a hedge, by first covering a ropeof rushes with a paste made of bramble-berries. In case ofnecessity, it is possible at the end of three years to transplantthe suckers of the laurel and the myrtle that have been thusre-produced.</p><p>With reference to the plants that are propagated from seed,Mago treats at considerable length of the nut-trees-he saysthat the almond<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> should be sown in a soft argillaceous earth,upon a spot that looks towards the south-that it thrives alsoin a hard, warm soil, but that in a soil which is either unctuousor moist, it is sure to die, or else to bear no fruit. He recom-mends also for sowing those more particularly which are of acurved shape like a sickle, and the produce of a young tree,<pb n="3463" />and he says that they should be steeped for three days indiluted manure, or else the day before they are sown in honeyand water.<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> He says, also, that they should be put in theground with the point downwards, and the sharp edge towardsthe north-east; and that they should be sown in threes andplaced triangularly, at the distance of a palm from each other,care being taken to water them for ten days, until such timeas they have germinated.</p><p>Walnuts when sown are placed lengthwise,<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> lying uponthe sides where the shells are joined; and pine nuts aremostly put, in sevens, into perforated pots, or else sown in thesame way as the berries are in the laurels which are re-producedby seed. The citron<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> is propagated from pips as well as layers,and the sorb from seed, by sucker, or by slip: the citron, however, requires a warm site, the sorb a cold and moist one.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Because the mode of cultivation adopted has little or no influence uponthem.
