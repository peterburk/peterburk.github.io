<div2 type="chapter" n="104" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 104.ÑWHY THE SEA IS SALT.</head><p>Hence it is that the widely-diffused sea is impregnatedwith the flavour of salt, in consequence of what is sweet andmild being evaporated from it, which the force of fire easilyaccomplishes; while all the more acrid and thick matter isleft behind; on which account the water of the sea is lesssalt at some depth than at the surface. And this is a moretrue cause of the acrid flavour, than that the sea is the continued perspiration of the land<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>, or that the greater part ofthe dry vapour is mixed with it, or that the nature of theearth is such that it impregnates the waters, and, as it were,<pb n="1130" />medicates them<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>. Among the prodigies which have occurred,there is one which happened when Dionysius, the tyrant ofSicily, was expelled from his kingdom; that, for the spaceof one day, the water in the harbour became sweet.</p><p>(101.) The moon, on the contrary, is said to be a feminineand delicate planet, and also nocturnal; also that it resolveshumours and draws them out, but does not carry them off.It is manifest that the carcases of wild beasts are renderedputrid by its beams, that, during sleep, it draws up theaccumulated torpor into the head, that it melts ice, andrelaxes all things by its moistening spirit<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>. Thus thechanges of nature compensate each other, and are alwaysadequate to their destined purpose; some of them congealingthe elements of the stars and others dissolving them. Themoon is said to be fed by fresh, and the sun by salt water.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Terr¾ sudor;" according to Aristotle, Meteor. ii. 4: this opinion.was adopted by some of the ancients.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The commentators discuss at considerable length the relative meritsof the three hypotheses here proposed, to account for the saltness of theocean; all of which are equally unfounded. See Hardouin in Lemaire,i. 434, 435. Aristotle's opinion on this subject is contained in his Meteor.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is not easy to ascertain the origin of the very general opinion respecting the peculiar physical action of the moon. The alleged facts are,for the most part, without foundation, and I am not aware of any circumstance which could, originally, have made them a part of the popularcreed of so many nations, ancient as well as modern. Perhaps some ofthe effects which have been ascribed to the specific action of the moon,may be explained by the lower temperature and greater dampness of theair, during the absence of the sun.</p></body>
