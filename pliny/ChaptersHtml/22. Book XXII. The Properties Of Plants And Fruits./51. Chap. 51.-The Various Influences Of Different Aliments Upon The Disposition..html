The first,<pb n="4436" />which is made of skimmed honey, is an extremely wholesome beverage for invalids who take nothing but a light diet,such as strained alica for instance: it reinvigorates the body,is soothing to the mouth and stomach, and by its refreshingproperties allays feverish heats. I find it stated,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> too, bysome authors, that to relax the bowels it should be taken cold,and that it is particularly well-suited for persons of a chillytemperament, or of a weak and pusillanimous<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> constitution,such as the Greeks, for instance, call "micropsychi."</p><p>For there is a theory,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> remarkable for its extreme ingenuity,first established by Plato, according to which the primary atomsof bodies, as they happen to be smooth or rough, angular orround, are more or less adapted to the various temperamentsof individuals: and hence it is, that the same substances arenot universally sweet or bitter to all. So, when affected withlassitude or thirst, we are more prone to anger than at othertimes.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> These asperities, however, of the disposition, or ratherI should say of the mind,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> are capable of being modified bythe sweeter beverages; as they tend to lubricate the passagesfor the respiration, and to mollify the channels, the work ofinhalation and exhalation being thereby unimpeded by anyrigidities. Every person must be sensible of this experiment-ally, in his own cease: there is no one in whom anger, affection, sadness, and all the emotions of the mind may not, insome degree, be modified by diet. It will therefore be worthour while to observe what aliments they are which exercise aphysical effect, not only upon the body, but the dispositionas well.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Aqua mulsa."
