According to some authorities, however, wine should only be given when the attacks come on,while others, again, are of opinion, that it must only be administered between the attacks; it being the object with theformer to arrest the profuse perspirations, while the latter basetheir practice on an impression that it may be given with moresafety at a moment when the malady has diminished in intensity; and this I find is the opinion entertained by most people.In all cases, wine must only be administered just after takingfood, never after sleep, and under no circumstances after anyother kind of drink, or in other words, only when the patientis thirsty; in no case whatever should it be given, except at thevery last extremity. Wine is better suited to males than tofemales, to aged people than to youths, to youths than to children, and to persons who are used to it than to those who arenot in the habit of taking it; winter, too, is a better time forusing it than summer. As to the quantity to be prescribed,and the proportion of water to be mixed with it, that dependsentirely upon the strength of the wine; it is generally thought,however, that the best proportions are one cyathus of wine andtwo of water. If, however, there is a derangement of thestomach, and if the food does not pass downward, the wine mustbe given in a larger proportion.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xi. c. 71.
