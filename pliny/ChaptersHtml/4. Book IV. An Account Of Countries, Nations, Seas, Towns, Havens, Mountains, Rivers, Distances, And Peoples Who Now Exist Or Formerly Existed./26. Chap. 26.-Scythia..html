<div2 type="chapter" n="26" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 26.—SCYTHIA.</head><p>Leaving the Ister, we come to the towns of Cremniscos<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>,Æpolium, the mountains of Macrocremnus, and the famousriver Tyra<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>, which gives name to a town on the spot whereOphiusa is said formerly to have stood. The Tyragetæinhabit a large island<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> situate in this river, which is distant<pb n="1331" />from Pseudostomos, a mouth of the Ister, so called, 130miles. We then come to the Axiacæ, who take their namefrom the river Axiaces<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, and beyond them, the Crobyzi, theriver Rhodes<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>, the Sagarian Gulf<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>, and the port ofOrdesos<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>.At a distance of 120 miles from the Tyra is the riverBorysthenes<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>, with a lake and a people of similar name, as alsoa town<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> in the interior, at a distance of fifteen miles from thesea, the ancient names of which were Olbiopolis and Miletopolis. Again, on the shore is the port of the Achæi, andthe island of Achilles<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>, famous for the tomb there of thathero, and, at a distance of 125 miles from it, a peninsulawhich stretches forth in the shape of a sword, in an obliquedirection, and is called, from having been his place of exercise,Dromos Achilleos<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>: the length of this, according to Agrippa,is eighty miles. The Taurian Scythians and the Siraci<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>occupy all this tract of country.</p><p>At this spot begins a well-wooded district<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>, which has<pb n="1332" />given to the sea that washes its banks the name of theHylæan Sea; its inhabitants are called Enœchadlæ<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>. Beyond them is the river Pantieapes<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>, which separates theNomades<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> and the Georgi, and after it the Acesinus<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span>. Someauthors say that the Panticapes flows into the Borysthenesbelow Olbia<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span>. Others, who are more correct, say that it isthe Hypanis<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span>: so great is the mistake made by those whohave placed it<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> in Asia.</p><p>The sea runs in here and forms a large gulf<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span>, until thereis only an intervening space<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> of five miles between it and theLake Mæotis, its margin forming the sea-line of extensivetracts of land, and numerous nations; it is known as the Gulfof Carcinites. Here we find the river Pacyris<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span>, the towns ofNavarum and Carcine<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span>, and behind it Lake Buges<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span>, which<pb n="1333" />discharges itself by a channel into the sea. This Buges isseparated by a ridge of rocks<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span> from Coretus, a gulf in theLake Mæotis; it receives the rivers Buges<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span>, Gerrus<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span>, andHypacaris<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span>, which approach it from regions that lie invarious directions. For the Gerrus separates the Basilidæfrom the Nomades, the Hypacaris flows through the Nomades and theHylæi, by an artificial channel into LakeBuges, and by its natural one into the Gulf of Coretus:this region bears the name of Scythia Sindice.</p><p>At the river Carcinites, Scythia Taurica<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span> begins, whichwas once covered by the sea, where we now see levelplains extended on every side: beyond this the land rises intomountains of great elevation. The peoples here are thirtyin number, of which twenty-three dwell in the interior, sixof the cities being inhabited by the Orgocyni, the Chara-ceni<span id="ref_31"><a href="#note_31">[31]</a></span>, the Lagyrani, the Tractari, the Arsilachitæ, and theCaliordi. The Scythotauri possess the range of mountains:on the west they are bounded by the Chersonesus, and onthe east by the Scythian Satarchæ<span id="ref_32"><a href="#note_32">[32]</a></span>. On the shore, afterwe leave Carcinites, we find the following towns; Taphræ<span id="ref_33"><a href="#note_33">[33]</a></span>,situate on the very isthmus of the peninsula, andthen Heraclea Chersonesus<span id="ref_34"><a href="#note_34">[34]</a></span>, to which its freedom has beengranted<span id="ref_35"><a href="#note_35">[35]</a></span> by the Romans. This place was formerly called<pb n="1334" />Megarice, being the most polished city throughout all theseregions, in consequence of its strict preservation of Grecianmanners and customs. A wall, five miles in length, surrounds it. Nextto this comes the Promontory of Parthenium<span id="ref_36"><a href="#note_36">[36]</a></span>, the city of theTauri, Placia, the port of the Symboli<span id="ref_37"><a href="#note_37">[37]</a></span>, and the Promontory ofCriumetopon<span id="ref_38"><a href="#note_38">[38]</a></span>, opposite toCarambis<span id="ref_39"><a href="#note_39">[39]</a></span>, a promontory of Asia, which runs out in themiddle of the Euxine, leaving an intervening space betweenthem of 170 miles, which circumstance it is in especial thatgives to this sea the form of a Scythian bow. After leavingthis headland we come to a great number of harbours andlakes of the Tauri<span id="ref_40"><a href="#note_40">[40]</a></span>. The town of Theodosia<span id="ref_41"><a href="#note_41">[41]</a></span> is distantfrom Criumetopon 125 miles, and from Chersonesus 165.Beyond it there were, in former times, the towns of Cytæ,Zephyrium, Acræ, Nymphæum, and Dia. Panticapæum<span id="ref_42"><a href="#note_42">[42]</a></span>, acity of the Milesians, by far the strongest of them all, isstill in existence; it lies at the entrance of the Bosporus,and is distant from Theodosia eighty-seven miles and a half,and from the town of Cimmerium, which lies on the otherside of the Strait, as we have previously<span id="ref_43"><a href="#note_43">[43]</a></span> stated, two milesand a half. Such is the width here of the channel whichseparates Asia from Europe, and which too, from beinggenerally quite frozen over, allows of a passage on foot.<pb n="1335" />The width of the Cimmerian Bosporus<span id="ref_44"><a href="#note_44">[44]</a></span> is twelve miles anda half: it contains the towns of Hermisium<span id="ref_45"><a href="#note_45">[45]</a></span>, Myrmecium,and, in the interior<span id="ref_46"><a href="#note_46">[46]</a></span> of it, the island of Alopece. From thespot called Taphræ<span id="ref_47"><a href="#note_47">[47]</a></span>, at the extremity of the isthmus, to themouth of the Bosporus, along the line of the Lake Mæotis,is a distance of 260 miles.</p><p>Leaving Taphræ, and going along the mainland, we findin the interior the Auchetæ<span id="ref_48"><a href="#note_48">[48]</a></span>, in whose country the Hypanishas its rise, as also the Neurœ, in whose district the Borystheneshas its source, the Geloni<span id="ref_49"><a href="#note_49">[49]</a></span>, the Thyssagetæ, the Budini,the Basilidæ, and the Agathyrsi<span id="ref_50"><a href="#note_50">[50]</a></span> with their azure-colouredhair. Above them are the Nomades, and then a nation ofAnthropophagi or cannibals. On leaving Lake Buges, abovethe Lake Mæotis we come to the Sauromatæ and theEssedones<span id="ref_51"><a href="#note_51">[51]</a></span>. Along the coast, as far as the riverTanais<span id="ref_52"><a href="#note_52">[52]</a></span>, are<pb n="1336" />the Mæotæ, from whom the lake derives its name, and thelast of all, in the rear of them, the Arimaspi. We thencome to the Riphæan<span id="ref_53"><a href="#note_53">[53]</a></span> mountains, and the region known bythe name of Pterophoros<span id="ref_54"><a href="#note_54">[54]</a></span>, because of the perpetual fall ofsnow there, the flakes of which resemble feathers; a part ofthe world which has been condemned by the decree ofnature to lie immersed in thick darkness; suited for nothingbut the generation of cold, and to be the asylum of thechilling blasts of the northern winds.</p><p>Behind these mountains, and beyond the region of thenorthern winds, there dwells, if we choose to believe it, ahappy race, known as the Hyperborei<span id="ref_55"><a href="#note_55">[55]</a></span>, a race that lives to anextreme old age, and which has been the subject of many marvellousstories<span id="ref_56"><a href="#note_56">[56]</a></span>. At this spot are supposed to be the hingesupon which the world revolves, and the extreme limits of therevolutions of the stars. Here we find light for six monthstogether, given by the sun in one continuous day, who doesnot, however, as some ignorant persons have asserted, concealhimself from the vernal equinox<span id="ref_57"><a href="#note_57">[57]</a></span> to autumn. On the contrary,to these people there is but one rising of the sun for the year,and that at the summer solstice, and but one setting, at thewinter solstice. This region, warmed by the rays of thesun, is of a most delightful temperature, and exempt from<pb n="1337" />every noxious blast. The abodes of the natives are thewoods and groves; the gods receive their worship singlyand in groups, while all discord and every kind of sickness arethings utterly unknown. Death comes upon themonly when satiated with life; after a career of feasting,in an old age sated with every luxury, they leap from acertain rock there into the sea; and this they deem themost desirable mode of ending existence. Some writers haveplaced these people, not in Europe, but at the very verge ofthe shores of Asia, because we find there a people called theAttacori<span id="ref_58"><a href="#note_58">[58]</a></span>, who greatly resemble them and occupy a verysimilar locality. Other writers again have placed them midway between the two suns, at the spot where it sets to theAntipodes and rises to us; a thing however that cannotpossibly be, in consequence of the vast tract of sea whichthere intervenes. Those writers who place them nowhere<span id="ref_59"><a href="#note_59">[59]</a></span>but under a day which lasts for six months, state that in themorning they sow, at mid-day they reap, at sunset theygather in the fruits of the trees, and during the night concealthemselves in caves. Nor are we at liberty to entertain anydoubts as to the existence of this race; so many authors<span id="ref_60"><a href="#note_60">[60]</a></span>are there who assert that they were in the habit of sendingtheir first-fruits to Delos to present them to Apollo, whomin especial they worship. Virgins used to carry them, whofor many years were held in high veneration, and receivedthe rites of hospitality from the nations that lay on theroute; until at last, in consequence of repeated violationsof good faith, the Hyperboreans came to the determinationto deposit these offerings upon the frontiers of the peoplewho adjoined them, and they in their turn were to convey<pb n="1338" />them on to their neighbours, and so from one to the other,till they should have arrived at Delos. However, thiscustom, even, in time fell into disuse.</p><p>The length of Sarmatia, Scythia, and Taurica, and of thewhole of the region which extends from the river Borysthenes, is, according to Agrippa, 980 miles, and its breadth717. I am of opinion, however, that in this part of theearth all estimates of measurement are exceedingly doubtful.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Placed by Forbiger near Lake Burmasaka, or near Islama.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Dniester.

It seems uncertain whether there are now any tracesof this ancient woodland; some of the old maps however give the nameof the "Black Forest" to this district. From the statements of moderntravellers, the woody country does not commence till the river Don hasbeen reached. The district of Hylæa has been identified by geographerswith the great plain of Janboylouk in the steppe of the Nogai.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">For Enœchadlæ, Hardouin suggests that we should read<hi rend="ital">Inde Hylœ,</hi>"hence the inhabitants are called by the name of Hylæi."</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Panticapes is usually identified with the modern Somara, butperhaps without sufficient grounds.
