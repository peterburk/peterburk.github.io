On the day be-fore<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> the nones of January, according to Cæsar's computation,the Dolphin rises in the morning, and on the next day, theLyre, upon the evening of which the Arrow sets to the people ofEgypt. Upon the sixth<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> day before the ides of January, the Dolphinsets in the evening, and Italy has many daysof continuous cold; the same is the case also when the sunenters Aquarius, about the sixteenth<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> day before the calends ofFebruary. On the eighth<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> before the calends of February, thestar which Tubero calls the Royal Star<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> sets in the morning inthe breast of Leo, and in the evening of the day before<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> thenones of February, the Lyre sets.</p><p>During the latter days of this period, whenever the natureof the weather will allow of it, the ground should be turnedup with a double mattock, for planting the rose and the vine—sixty men to a jugerum. Ditches, too, should be cleanedout, or new ones made; and the time of day-break may be usefullyemployed in sharpening iron tools, fitting on handles,repairing such dolia<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> as may have been broken, and rubbingup and cleaning their staves.<pb n="4084" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Thirtieth of December.
