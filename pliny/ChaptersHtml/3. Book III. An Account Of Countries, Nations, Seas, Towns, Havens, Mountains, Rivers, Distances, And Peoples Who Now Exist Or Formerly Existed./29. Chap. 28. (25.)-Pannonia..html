(25.)—PANNONIA.</head><p>Next to them comes acorn-bearing Pannonia<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>, alongwhich the chain of the Alps, gradually lessening as it runsthrough the middle of Illyricum from north to south, formsa gentle slope on the right hand and the left. The portionwhich looks towards the Adriatic Sea is called Dalmatiaand Illyricum, above mentioned, while Pannonia stretchesaway towards the north, and has the Danube for its extremeboundary. In it are the colonies of Æmona<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and Siscia.The following rivers, both known to fame and adapted forcommerce, flow into the Danube; the Draus<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>, which rushesfrom Noricum with great impetuosity, and the Savus<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, whichflows with a more gentle current from the Carnic Alps, therebeing a space between them of 120 miles. The Draus runsthrough the Serretes, the Serrapilli<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>, the Iasi, and theAndizetes; the Savus through the Colapiani<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> and the Breuci;these are the principal peoples. Besides them there arethe Arivates, the Azali, the Amantini, the Belgites, theCatari, the Cornacates, the Eravisci, the Hercuniates<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>, the<pb n="1264" />Latovici, the Oseriates, the Varciani, and, in front of MountClaudius, the Scordisci, behind it the Taurisci. In the Savusthere is the island of Metubarris<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>, the greatest of all theislands formed by rivers. Besides the above, there arethese other rivers worthy of mention:—the Colapis<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>, whichflows into the Savus near Siscia, where, dividing its channel,it forms the island which is called Segestica<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> a; and the riverBacuntius<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>, which flows into the Savus at the town of Sirmium,where we find the state of the Sirmienses and theAmantini. Forty-five miles thence is Taurunum<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>, wherethe Savus flows into the Danube; above which spot theValdanus<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> and the Urpanus, themselves far from ignoblerivers, join that stream.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This province corresponded to the eastern part of Austria, Styria,Carinthia, Carniola, the whole of Hungary between the Danube andSaave, Slavonia, and part of Croatia and Bosnia.

He calls the island Segetica.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now the Bossut.
