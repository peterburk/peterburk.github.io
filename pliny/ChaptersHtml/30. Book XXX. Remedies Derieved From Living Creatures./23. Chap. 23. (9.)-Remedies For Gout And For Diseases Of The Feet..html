<div2 type="chapter" n="23" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 23. (9.)—REMEDIES FOR GOUT AND FOR DISEASES OF THEFEET.</head><p>To prevent varicose veins, the legs of children are rubbedwith a lizard's blood: but both the party who operates and thepatient must be fasting at the time. Wool-grease, mixed withwoman's milk and white lead, has a soothing effect upon gout;the liquid dung also voided by sheep; a sheep's lights; aram's gall, mixed with suet; mice, split asunder and applied;a weasel's blood, used as a liniment with plantago; the ashesof a weasel burnt alive, mixed with vinegar and oil of roses,and applied with a feather, or used in combination with waxand oil of roses; a dog's gall, due care being taken not to touchit with the hand, and to apply it with a feather; poultry dung;or else ashes of burnt earth-worms, applied with honey, andremoved at the end of a couple of days. Some, however, prefer using this last with water, while others, again, apply theworms themselves, in the proportion of one acetabulum<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> tothree cyathi of honey, the feet of the patient being first anointedwith oil of roses. The broad, flat, kind of snail, taken in drink,is used for the removal of pains in the feet and joints; two ofthem being pounded for the purpose and taken in wine. Theyare employed, also, in the form of a liniment, mixed with thejuice of the plant helxine:<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> some, however, are content tobeat up the snails with vinegar. Some say that salt, burntin a new earthen vessel with a viper, and taken repeatedly, iscurative of gout, and that it is an excellent plan to rub thefeet with viper's fat. It is asserted, too, that similar resultsare produced by keeping a kite till it is dry, and then powdering it and taking it in water, a pinch in three fingers at atime; by rubbing the feet with the blood of that bird mixedwith nettles; or by bruising the first feathers of a ring-dovewith nettles. The dung of ring-doves is used as a linimentfor pains in the joints; the ashes also of a burnt weasel, orof burnt snails, mixed with amylum<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> or gum tragacanth.</p><p>A very excellent cure for contusions of the joints is a spider'sweb; but there are persons who give the preference to ashesof burnt cobwebs or of burnt pigeons' dung, mixed withpolenta and white wine. For sprains of the joints a sovereign<pb n="5448" />remedy is mutton suet, mixed with the ashes of a woman's hair;a good application, too, for chilblains is mutton suet, mixedwith alum, or else ashes of a burnt dog's head or of burntmouse-dung. Ulcers, free from discharge, are brought to cicatrize by using the above-named substances in combination withwax; ashes, also, of burnt dormice, mixed with oil; ashes ofburnt wood-mice, mixed with honey; ashes of burnt earthworms, applied with old oil; or else ashes of the snails withouta shell that are so commonly found. All ulcers on the feet arecured by the application of ashes of snails, burnt alive; andfor excoriations of the feet, ashes of burnt poultry-dung areused, or ashes of burnt pigeons' dung, mixed with oil. Whenthe feet have been galled by the shoes, the ashes of an old shoe-sole are used, or the lights of a lamb or ram. For gatheringsbeneath<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> the nails, a horse's tooth, powdered, is a sovereignremedy. A light application of a green lizard's blood, willcure the feet of man or beast when galled beneath.</p><p>For the removal of corns upon the feet, the urine of a muleof either sex is applied, mixed with the mud which it hasformed upon the ground; sheep's dung, also; the liver of agreen lizard, or the blood of that animal, applied in wool;earth-worms, mixed with oil; the head of a spotted lizard,pounded with an equal quantity of vitex and mixed with oil;or pigeons' dung, boiled with vinegar. For the cure of all kindsof warts, dogs' urine is applied fresh, with the mud which ithas formed upon the ground; dogs' dung, also, reduced to ashesand mixed with wax; sheep's dung; the blood of mice, ap-plied fresh, or the body of a mouse, split asunder; the gall ofa hedgehog; a lizard's head or blood, or the ashes of thatanimal, burnt entire; the cast-off slough of a snake; or elsepoultry dung, applied with oil and nitre. Cantharides, also,bruised with Taminian<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> grapes, act corrosively upon warts:but when warts have been thus removed, the remedies shouldbe employed which we have pointed out for ulcerations on theskin.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Acetabuli mensurâ" seems a preferable reading to "aceto mensurâ,"which makes no sense.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxi. c. 56.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xviii. c. 17.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Subluviem."
