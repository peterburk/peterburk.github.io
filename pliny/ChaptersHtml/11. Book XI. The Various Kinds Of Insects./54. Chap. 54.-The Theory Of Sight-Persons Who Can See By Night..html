<div2 type="chapter" n="54" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 54.ÑTHE THEORY OF SIGHTÑPERSONS WHO CAN SEE BYNIGHT.</head><p>In addition to this, there are some persons who can see to a<pb n="3051" />very great distance, while there are others, again, who can onlydistinguish objects when brought quite close to them. Thevision of many stands in need of the rays of the sun; suchpersons cannot see on a cloudy day, nor yet after the sun hasset. Others, again, have bad sight in the day-time, but asight superior to that of others by night. Of persons havingdouble pupils, or the evil eye, we have already spoken<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> atsufficient length. Blue<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> eyes are the best for seeing in thedark.</p><p>It is said that Tiberius C¾sar, like no other human being,was so endowed by Nature, that on awaking in the night<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> hecould for a few moments distinguish objects just as well asin the clearest daylight, but that by degrees he would findhis sight again enveloped in darkness. The late EmperorAugustus had azure eyes like those of some horses, the whitebeing larger than with other men; he used to be very angryif a person stared intently at them for this peculiarity. ClaudiusC¾sar had at the corners of the eyes a white fleshy substance,covered with veins, which would occasionally become suffusedwith blood; with the Emperor Caius<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> they had a fixed, steadygaze, while Nero could see nothing distinctly without winking, and having it brought close to his eyes. The EmperorCaius had twenty pairs of gladiators in his training-school,and of all these there were only two who did not wink theeyes when a menacing gesture was made close to them: henceit was that these men were invincible. So difficult a matter isit for a man to keep his eyes from winking: indeed, to wink isso natural to many, that they cannot desist from it; such persons we generally look upon as the most timid.</p><p>No persons have the eye all of one colour; that of themiddle of the eye is always different from the white whichsurrounds it. In all animals there is no part in the wholebody that is a stronger exponent of the feelings, and in manmore especially, for it is from the expression of the eye thatwe detect clemency, moderation, compassion, hatred, love,sadness, and joy. From the eyes, too, the various charactersof persons are judged of, according as they are ferocious, me-<pb n="3052" />nacing, sparkling, sedate, leering, askance, downcast, or lan-guishing. Beyond a doubt it is in the eyes that the mind hasits abode: sometimes the look is ardent, sometimes fixed andsteady, at other times the eyes are humid, and at others, again,half closed. From these it is that the tears of pity flow, andwhen we kiss them we seem to be touching the very soul. Itis the eyes that weep, and from them proceed those streamsthat moisten our cheeks as they trickle down. And what isthis liquid that is always so ready and in such abundance inour moments of grief; and where is it kept in reserve at othertimes? It is by the aid of the mind that we see, by the aidof the mind that we enjoy perception; while the eyes, like somany vessels, as it were, receive its visual faculties and transmit them. Hence it is that profound thought renders a manblind for the time, the powers of sight being withdrawn fromexternal objects and thrown inward: so, too, in epilepsy, themind is covered with darkness, while the eyes, though open,are able to see nothing. In addition to this, it is the factthat hares, as well as many human beings, can sleep withthe eyes open, a thing which the Greeks express by the term<foreign lang="greek">xorubantia=|n.</foreign> Nature has composed the eye of numerous membranes of remarkable thinness, covering them with a thick coatto ensure their protection against heat and cold. This coat shepurifies from time to time by the lachrymal humours, and shehas made the surface lubricous and slippery, to protect the eyeagainst the effects of a sudden shock.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">B. vii. c. 2.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"C¾sii."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The same has been said also of Cardan, the elder Scaliger, TheodoreBeza, the French physician Mairan, and the republican Camille Desmoulins.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Caligula.</p></body>
