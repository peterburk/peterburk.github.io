The sameis done, too, with the fine wheat-bran of the best quality; itis kneaded with white must three days old, and then dried inthe sun, after which it is made into small cakes. When required for making bread, these cakes are first soaked in water,<pb n="4039" />and then boiled with the finest spelt flour, after which the wholeis mixed up with the meal; and it is generally thought thatthis is the best method of making bread. The Greeks haveestablished a rule that for a modius of meal eight ounces ofleaven is enough.</p><p>These kinds of leaven, however, can only be made at thetime of vintage, but there is another leaven which may be prepared with barley and water, at any time it may happen to berequired. It is first made up into cakes of two pounds inweight, and these are then baked upon a hot hearth, or else inan earthen dish upon hot ashes and charcoal, being left tillthey turn of a reddish brown. When this is done, the cakesare shut close in vessels, until they turn quite sour: whenwanted for leaven, they are steeped in water first. Whenbarley bread used to be made, it was leavened with the mealof the fitch,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> or else the chicheling vetch,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> the proportionbeing, two pounds of leaven to two modii and a half of barleymeal. At the present day, however, the leaven is preparedfrom the meal that is used for making the bread. For thispurpose, some of the meal is kneaded before adding the salt,and is then boiled to the consistency of porridge, and left tillit begins to turn sour. In most cases, however, they do notwarm it at all, but only make use of a little of the dough thathas been kept from the day before. It is very evident that theprinciple which causes the dough to rise is of an acid nature,and it is equally evident that those persons who are dietedupon fermented bread are stronger<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> in body. Among theancients, too, it was generally thought that the heavier wheatis, the more wholesome it is.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or grape-juice.
