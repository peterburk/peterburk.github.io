<div2 type="chapter" n="18" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 18.—THE DIFFERENT SPECIES OF LIONS.</head><p>There are two species of lions; in the one the body is shorterand more compact, and the mane more crisp and curly;<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> theseare more timid than those with a longer body and straight hair,which, in fact, have no fear of wounds. The males raise theleg like the dog, when they pass their urine;<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> which has amost disagreeable odour, the same being the case too with theirbreath. They seldom drink, and only take food every otherday;<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> when they have gorged themselves, they will sometimes<pb n="2267" />go without food for three days. They swallow their food whole,without mastication, so far as they are able; and when theyhave taken more than the stomach can possibly receive, theyextract part of it by thrusting their claws into the throat; thesame too, if, when full, they have occasion to take to flight.That they are very long-lived is proved by the fact, that manyof them are found without teeth. Polybius,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> the companion ofÆmilianus, tells us, that when they become aged they will attack men, as they have no longer sufficient strength for thepursuit of wild beasts. It is then that they lay siege to thecities of Africa; and for this reason it was, that he, as well asScipio, had seen some of them hung upon a cross; it beingsupposed that others, through dread of a similar punishment,might be deterred from committing the like outrages.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier remarks, that we have no knowledge of the lion with curledhair, so frequently spoken of by the ancients. He suggests that there mayhave been a peculiar variety between the rivers Achelous and Nestus orMestus, or perhaps, more probably, that it was altogether imaginary. Hestates also, that we no longer see lions without manes, but that Olivierhad seen some at Bagdat. Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. ix. c. 44, speaks ofthe two species of lions, and describes them nearly as Pliny has done.—B.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">According to Cuvier, this is not the case; the lion passes its urinejust as the other animals of the same family. Pliny again refers to theodour of the lion's breath, in B. xi. e. 115.—B.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The lion, like other carnivorous animals, is able to receive a large quantity of food into the stomach, and to remain for a proportionably longerperiod without eating; but the statement respecting its taking food onalternate days, is without foundation. There does not appear to be anyground for the account of the mode by which it relieves the stomach whenovercharged.—B.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We learn from Cicero, Ep. Fam. B. v. Ep. 12, that Polybius wrote ahistory of the Numantine war, in which we may presume the accounthere referred to was contained.—B.</p></body>
