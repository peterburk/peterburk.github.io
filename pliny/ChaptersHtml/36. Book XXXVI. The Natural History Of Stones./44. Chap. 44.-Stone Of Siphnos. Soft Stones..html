SOFT STONES.</head><p>At Siphnos,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> there is a kind of stone<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> which is hollowedand turned in the lathe, for making cooking-utensils and vesselsfor keeping provisions; a thing too, that, to my own knowledge,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>is done with the green stone<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> of Comum<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> in Italy.With reference, however, to the stone of Siphnos, it is a singularfact, that, when heated in oil, though naturally very soft,it becomes hard and black; so great a difference is there inthe qualities of stone.</p><p>There are some remarkable instances, too, beyond the Alps, ofthe natural softness of some kinds of stone. In the provinceof the Belgæ, there is a white stone<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> which admits of being cutwith the saw that is used for wood, and with greater facilityeven. This stone is used as a substitute for roof-tiles andgutter-tiles, and even for the kind of roofing known as thepavonaceous<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> style, if that is preferred. Such are the stonesthat admit of being cut into thin slabs.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. iv. cc. 22, 23.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ajasson identifies it with Ollar stone, talc, or soap-stone, a hydroussilicate of magnesia, and nearly allied to the Ophites of Chapters 11 and 30.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He being a native of that part of Italy.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Green Colubine Ollar stone, or soap-stone of Italy.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. iii. c. 21.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Identified by Brotero with our Free-stone or grit-stone.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">So called from its resemblance to the spots on a peacock's tail. Healludes, probably, to the mode of roofing with tiles cut in the form ofscales, still much employed on the continent, and in Switzerland moreparticularly.</p></body>
