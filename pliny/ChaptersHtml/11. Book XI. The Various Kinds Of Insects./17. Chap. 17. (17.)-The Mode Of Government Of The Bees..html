(17.)â€”THE MODE OF GOVERNMENT OF THE BEES.</head><p>Let a man employ himself, forsooth, in the enquiry whetherthere has been only one Hercules, how many fathers Liberthere have been, and all the other questions which are burieddeep in the mould of antiquity! Here behold a tiny object,one to be met with at most of our country retreats, and numbers of which are always at hand, and yet, after all, it is notagreed among authors whether or not the king<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> is the only oneamong them that is provided with no sting, and is possessedof no other arms than those afforded him by his majestic office,or whether Nature has granted him a sting, and has only deniedhim the power of making use of it; it being a well-knownfact, that the ruling bee never does use a sting. The obedience which his subjects manifest in his presence is quite surprising. When he goes forth, the whole swarm attends him,throngs about him, surrounds him, protects him, and will notallow him to be seen. At other times, when the swarm is atwork within, the king is seen to visit the works, and appearsto be giving his encouragement, being himself the only onethat is exempt from work: around him are certain other beeswhich act as body-guards and lictors, the careful guardians ofhis authority. The king never quits the hive except when theswarm is about to depart; a thing which may be known a longtime beforehand, as for some days a peculiar buzzing noiseis to be heard within, which denotes that the bees are waitingfor a favourable day, and making all due preparations for theirdeparture. On such an occasion, if care is taken to deprive theking of one of his wings, the swarm will not fly away. Whenthey are on the wing, every one is anxious to be near him, andtakes a pleasure in being seen in the performance of its duty.When he is weary, they support him on their shoulders; and<pb n="3019" />when he is quite tired, they carry him outright. If one of themfalls in the rear from weariness, or happens to go astray, it isable to follow the others by the aid of its acuteness of smell.Wherever the king bee happens to settle, that becomes theencampment of all.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The queen has a sting, like the working bees, but uses it less fre-quently.</p></body>
