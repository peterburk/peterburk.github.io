<div2 type="chapter" n="4" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 4.—CARBUNCLE.</head><p>We find it stated in the Annals, that it was in the censorship<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>of L. Paulus and Q. Marcius that carbuncle<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> was first introduced into Italy, a malady which till then had confined itselfsolely to the province of Gallia Narbonensis. In the yearin which I am writing these lines, two persons of consularrank have died of this disease, Julius Rufus<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and Q. LecaniusBassus;<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> the former in consequence of an incision unskilfullymade by his medical attendants, the latter through a woundupon the thumb of the left hand by pricking a carbuncle witha needle, a wound so small originally as to be hardly perceptible.</p><p>This disease makes its appearance in the more hidden<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> partsof the human body, and mostly beneath the tongue. It originally has the form of a hard, red, pimple, with a blackishhead mostly, though sometimes of a livid colour. It producestension of the flesh, but unattended with swelling, pain, orany itching sensation; indeed, the only symptom that accompanies it is a confirmed drowsiness, which overpowers the patient, and carries him off in the course of three days. Sometimes, however, it is accompanied with shuddering, and smallpustules about the sore; and occasionally, though but rarely,with fever. When these symptoms extend to the fauces andœsophagus, death ensues with the greatest rapidity.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A.U.C. 590.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Carbunculus." A malignant pustule, accompanied with swelling andending with gangrene, is still known by this name, but it does not manifest any particular preference for the mouth and tongue. Fée says thatcarbuncle was recently (<date value="1833" authname="1833">1833</date>) endemic in Provence, the ancient GalliaNarbonensis, for which reason it had received the name of "Charbon Provencal."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Consul, A.U.C. 819.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Consul, A.U.C. 816.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Judging from this symptom, Dalechamps says that it looks more likechancre than carbuncle.</p></body>
