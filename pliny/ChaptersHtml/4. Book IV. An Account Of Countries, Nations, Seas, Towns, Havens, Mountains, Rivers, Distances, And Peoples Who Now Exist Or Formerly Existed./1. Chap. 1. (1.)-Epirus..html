(1.)—EPIRUS.</head><p>The third great Gulf of Europe begins at the mountainsof Acroceraunia<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>, and ends at the Hellespont, embracing anextent of 2500 miles, exclusive of the sea-line of nineteensmaller gulfs. Upon it are Epirus, Acarnania, Ætolia, Phocis,Locris, Achaia, Messenia, Laconia, Argolis, Megaris, Attica,Bœotia; and again, upon the other sea<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>, the same Phocisand Locris, Doris, Phthiotis, Thessalia, Magnesia, Macedoniaand Thracia. All the fabulous lore of Greece, as well as theeffulgence of her literature, first shone forth upon the banksof this Gulf. We shall therefore dwell a little the longerupon it.</p><p>Epirus<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>, generally so called, begins at the mountains ofAcroceraunia. The first people that we meet are the Chaones,from whom Chaonia<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> receives its name, then the Thesproti<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>,and then the Antigonenses<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>. We then come to the placewhere Aornos<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> stood, with its exhalations so deadly to thefeathered race, the Cestrinis<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>, the Perrhæbi<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>, in whose coun-<pb n="1272" />try Mount Pindus is situate, the Cassiopæi<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>, the Dryopes<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>,the Sellæ<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>, the Hellopes<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>, the Molossi, in whose territory isthe temple of the Dodonæan Jupiter, so famous for its oracle;and Mount Tomarus<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>, so highly praised by Theopompus,with its hundred springs gushing from its foot.</p><p>(2.) Epirus, properly so called, advances towards Magnesia andMacedonia, having at its back the Dassaretæ,previously<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> mentioned, a free nation, and after them theDardani, a savage race. On the left hand, before the Dardaniare extended the Triballi and the nations of Mœsia, while infront of them the Medi and the Denselatæ join, and next tothem the Thracians, who stretch away as far as the Euxine:in such a manner is a rampart raised around the lofty heightsof Rhodope, and then of Hæmus.</p><p>On the coast of Epirus is the fortress of Chimær<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span>,situate upon the Acroceraunian range, and below it thespring known as the Royal Waters<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span>; then the towns of<pb n="1273" />Mæandria, and Cestria<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span>, the Thyamis<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span>, a river of Thesprotia,the colony of Buthrotum<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span>, and the Ambracian Gulf<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span>, sofamed in history; which, with an inlet only half a mile inwidth, receives a vast body of water from the sea, beingthirty-seven miles in length, and fifteen in width. The riverAcheron, which runs through Acherusia, a lake of Thesprotia, flowsinto it<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> after a course of thirty-six miles; it is consideredwonderful for its bridge, 1000 feet in length, by apeople who look upon everything as wonderful that belongsto themselves. Upon this Gulf is also situate the town ofAmbracia. There are also the Aphas and the Arachthus<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span>,rivers of the Molossi; the city of Anactoria<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span>, and the placewhere Pandosia<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span> stood.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called Monti della Chimera, or Mountains of Khimara. Seep. 262.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Ægean Sea, the present Archipelago.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This country contained, according to Pouqueville, the presentSangiacs of Janina, Delvino, and Chamouri, with the Vavodilika orPrincipality of Arta. This name was originally given to the whole ofthe west ofGreece, from the Promontory of Acroceraunia to the entrance of theCorinthian Gulf, in contradistinction to Corcyra and the island ofCephallenia.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This district, according to Pouqueville, occupied the present Cantonsof Chimera, Iapouria, Arboria, Paracaloma, and Philates.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">They occupied the site of the present Paramythia, according toPouqueville.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Antigonia was about a mile distant, Pouqueville says, from themodern town of Tebelen.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From 'A "not," and <foreign lang="greek">o)/rnis</foreign> "a bird." Its site is nowunknown. There were many places of this name. Avernus or Aornos inCampania has been previously mentioned.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The remains of Cestria are still to be seen at Palea Vnetia, nearthe town of Filiates. Pouqueville calls the place Chamouri.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">According to Pouqueville, the modern Zagori stands on the site ofPerrhæbia. Pindus is sometimes called Grammos, but is still known byits ancient name.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cassiope or Cassope stood near the sea, and near the present villageof Kamarina. Its extensive ruins are still to be seen.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Their district, according to Pouqueville, was in the present Cantonof Drynopolis.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Selli or Sellæ lived in the vicinity of the temple of Jupiter atDodona, in the modern canton of Souli, according to Pouqueville.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The country about Dodona is called Hellopia by Hesiod. By somethe Helli or Hellopes are considered the same as the Selli. Pouquevillethinks that the Hellopes dwelt in the modern cantons of Janina, Pogoniani, Sarachovitzas, and Courendas, and that the temple of Jupiter stoodat the spot now called Proskynisis, near Gardiki, the town of Dodonabeing near Castritza. Leake is of the same opinion as to the site of thetown; but, as has been a subject of remark, it is the only place of celebrityin Greece of which the situation is not exactly known. Leake howeverthinks that the temple stood on the peninsula now occupied by thecitadel of Joanina.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pouqueville thinks that this is the hill to be seen at the modern village of Gardiki. He is also of opinion that the springs here mentionedare those at the modern village of Besdounopoulo. His opinions howeveron these points have not been implicitly received.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">B. iii. c. 26. The Dardani, Triballi, and Mœsi are mentioned inc. 29. The localities of the other tribes here mentioned are not knownwith any exactness.</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It retains the same name or that of Khimara, and gives its name tothe Acroceraunian range. It was situate at the foot of the chain, whichbegins at this spot.</p><p><span id="note_17"><a href="#ref_17">17. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Aquæ regiæ." Pouqueville suggests, without good reason, as Ansart thinks, that this spring was situate near the modern Drimodez orDermadez.</p><p><span id="note_18"><a href="#ref_18">18. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The place called Palæo-Kistes now stands on its site, and someremains of antiquity are to be seen.</p><p><span id="note_19"><a href="#ref_19">19. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now the Calama.</p><p><span id="note_20"><a href="#ref_20">20. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Its ruins are to be seen near the modern Butrinto. It was said tohave been founded by Helenus, the son of Priam. Pamponius Atticushad an estate here.</p><p><span id="note_21"><a href="#ref_21">21. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This corresponds to the present Gulf of Arta, and was especially famousfor being the scene of the battle of Actium. The city of Ambracia lay tothe north of it. The present Arta is generally believed to occupy its site.</p><p><span id="note_22"><a href="#ref_22">22. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pouqueville has shown that Pliny is in error here, and he says thatthe Acheron is the modern Mavro Potamos; but according to Leake,the name of it is Gurla, or the river of Suli. It flows into the Port Fanari, formerly called Glykys Limen, or Sweet Harbour, from the freshness of the water there. The Acherusian Lake is probably the greatmarsh that lies below Kastri.</p><p><span id="note_23"><a href="#ref_23">23. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is now called the Arta, and gives name to the Gulf.</p><p><span id="note_24"><a href="#ref_24">24. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The site of Anactoria or Anactorium, like that of its neighbour Actium, has been a subject of much dispute; but it is now pretty generallyagreed that the former stood on the modern Cape Madonna, and Actiumon the headland of La Punta.</p><p><span id="note_25"><a href="#ref_25">25. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pouqueville takes the ruins in the vicinity of Turco Palaka, eightmiles from Margariti, to be those of Pandosia.</p></body>
