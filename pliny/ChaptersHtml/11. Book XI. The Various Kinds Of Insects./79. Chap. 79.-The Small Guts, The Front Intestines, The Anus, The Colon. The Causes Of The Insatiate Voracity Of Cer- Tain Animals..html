THE CAUSES OF THE INSATIATE VORACITY OF CER-TAIN ANIMALS.</head><p>After the belly we find in man and the sheep the " lactes,"<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>the place of which in other animals is occupied by the"hill¾:"<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> it is through these organs that the food passes.We then find the larger intestines, which communicate withthe anus, and which in man consist of extremely sinuousfolds. Those animals which have the longest intestinal canal,are the most voracious; and those which have the belly themost loaded with fat, are the least intelligent. There aresome birds, also, which have two receptacles; the one ofwhich is the crop, in which they stow away the food which<pb n="3072" />they have just swallowed, while the other is the belly, intowhich they discharge the food when it is duly preparedand digested; this is the case with the domestic fowl, thering-dove, the pigeon, and the partridge. The other birdsare in general destitute of crop, but then they have a more capacious gorge, the jackdaw, the raven, and the crow, for instance: some, again, are constituted in neither manner, buthave the belly close to the gorge, those, for instance, whichhave the neck very long and narrow, such as the porphyrio.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span></p><p>In the solid-hoofed animals the belly is rough and hard,while in some land animals it is provided with rough asperities like teeth,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and in others, again, it has a reticulated surface like that of a file. Those animals which have not theteeth on both sides, and do not ruminate, digest the food inthe belly, from whence it descends to the lower intestines.There is an organ in all animals attached in the middle tothe navel, and in man similar in its lower part to that of theswine, the name given thereto by the Greeks being " colon,"a part of the body which is subject to excruciating pains.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>In dogs this gut is extremely contracted, for which reason it isthat they are unable to ease it, except by great efforts, and notwithout considerable suffering. Those animals with which thefood passes at once from the belly through the straight intestine,are of insatiate appetite, as, for instance, the hind-wolf,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> andamong birds the diver. The elephant has four<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> bellies; therest of its intestines are similar to those of the swine, andthe lungs are four times as large as those of the ox. The bellyin birds is fleshy, and formed of a callous substance. In thatof young swallows there are found little white or pink pebbles,known by the name of " chelidonii," and said to be employedin magical incantations. In the second belly of the heiferthere is a black tufa found, round like a ball,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> and of noweight to speak of: this, it is generally thought, is singu-<pb n="3073" />larly efficacious in laborious deliveries, if it happens not tohave touched the ground.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or small guts.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or front intestines.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The coot, probably.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He alludes to the papill¾ of the mucous gland.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The colic.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Lupus cervarius."
