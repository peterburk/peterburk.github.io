<div2 type="chapter" n="79" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 79. (58.)—WHEN BIRDS LAY, AND HOW MANY EGGS. THEVARIOUS KINDS OF HERONS.</head><p>Pigeons have the peculiarity of billing before they couple;they generally lay two eggs, Nature so willing it, that amongbirds the produce should be more frequent with some, and morenumerous with others. The ring-dove and turtle-dove mostlylay three eggs, and never more than twice, in the spring;such being the case when the first brood has been lost. Althoughthey may happen to lay three eggs, they never hatch morethan two; the third egg, which is barren, is generally knownby the name of "urinum."<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> The female ring-dove sits onthe eggs from mid-day till morning, the male the rest of thetime. Pigeons always produce a male and a female; themale first, the female the day after. Both the male andthe female pigeon sit on the eggs; the male in the day-time,the female during the night. They hatch on the twentiethday of incubation, and lay the fifth day after coupling. Sometimes, indeed, in summer, these birds will rear three couplesin two months; for then they hatch on the eighteenth day ofincubation, and immediately conceive again; hence it is thateggs are often found among the young ones, some of whichlast are just taking wing, while others are only burstingthe shell. The young ones, themselves, begin to produce atthe age of five months. The females, if there should happento be no male among them, will even tread each other, and lay<pb n="2538" />barren eggs, from which nothing is produced. By the Greeks,these eggs are called "hypenemia.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span></p><p>(59.) The pea-hen produces at three years old. In thefirst year she will lay one or two eggs, in the next four orfive, and in the remaining years twelve, but never beyondthat number. She lays for two or three days at intervals, andwill produce three broods in the year, if care is taken to putthe eggs under a common hen. The males are apt to breakthe eggs in getting at the females while sitting, and hence itis that the pea-hen lays by night, and in secret places, or elsesits on her eggs in an elevated spot; the eggs will break, too,unless they are received upon some surface that is soft. Onemale is sufficient for every five females; when there are onlyone or two females to a male, all chance of their being prolificis spoilt through their extreme salaciousness. The youngbreaks the shell in twenty-seven days, or, at the very latest,on the thirtieth.</p><p>Geese pair in the water, and lay in spring; or, if theyhave paired in the winter, they lay about forty eggs, after thesummer solstice. The hatching takes place twice in the year,if a hen hatches the first brood; otherwise, their greatest number of eggs will be sixteen, their lowest seven. If their eggsare taken away from them, they will keep on laying until theyburst; they will not hatch the eggs of any other birds. Thebest number of eggs for placing under the goose for hatching,is nine, or else eleven. The females only sit, and that forthirty days; but if they are kept very warm, then only twenty-five. The contact of the nettle is fatal to their young, andtheir own greediness is no less so-sometimes, through overeating, and sometimes through over-exertion; for seizing theroot of a plant with the bill, they will make repeated effortsto tear it out of the ground, and so, at last, dislocate theneck. A remedy against the noxious effects of the nettle, is toplace the root of that plant under the straw of their nest.</p><p>(60.) There are three kinds of herons, called, respectively,the leucon,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> the asterias,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and the pellos.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> These birds experience great pain in coupling; uttering loud cries, the males<pb n="2539" />bleed from the eyes, while the females lay their eggs with noless difficulty.</p><p>The eagle sits for thirty days, as do most of the larger birds;the smaller ones, the kite and the hawk for instance, onlytwenty. The eagle mostly lays but one egg, never more thanthree. The bird which is known as the "ægolios,"<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> lays four,and the raven sometimes five; they sit, too, the same numberof days as the kite and the hawk. The male crow providesthe female with food while she is sitting. The magpie laysnine eggs, the malancoryphus more than twenty, but alwaysan uneven number, and no bird of this kind ever lays more; somuch superior in fecundity are the smaller birds. The youngones of the swallow are blind at first, as is the case also withalmost all the birds the progeny of which is numerous.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Meaning the "urine-egg."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "wind" eggs.
