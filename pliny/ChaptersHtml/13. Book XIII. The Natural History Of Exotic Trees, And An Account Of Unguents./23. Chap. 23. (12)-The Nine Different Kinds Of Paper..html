<div2 type="chapter" n="23" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 23. (12)—THE NINE DIFFERENT KINDS OF PAPER.</head><p>Paper is made from the papyrus, by splitting it with a<pb n="3188" />needle into very thin leaves, due care being taken that theyshould be as broad as possible. That of the first quality istaken from the centre of the plant, and so in regular succession,according to the order of division. "Hieratica"<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> was the namethat was anciently given to it, from the circumstance that itwas entirely reserved for the religious books. In later times,through a spirit of adulation, it received the name of "Augusta," just as that of second quality was called "Liviana,"from his wife, Livia; the consequence of which was, that thename "hieratica" came to designate that of only third-ratequality. The paper of the next quality was called "amphitheatrica," from the locality<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> of its manufacture. The skilfulmanufactory that was established by Fannius<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> at Rome, was inthe habit of receiving this last kind, and there, by a verycareful process of insertion, it was rendered much finer; somuch so, that from being a common sort, he made it a paper offirst-rate quality, and gave his own<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> name to it: while thatwhich was not subjected to this additional process retainedits original name of "amphitheatrica." Next to this is theSaitic paper, so called from the city of that name,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> whereit is manufactured in very large quantities, though of cuttingsof inferior<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> quality. The Tæniotic paper, so called from aplace in the vicinity,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> is manufactured from the materials thatlie nearer to the outside skin; it is sold, not according to itsquality, but by weight only. As to the paper that is known<pb n="3189" />as "emporetica,"<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> it is quite useless for writing upon, and isonly employed for wrapping up other paper, and as a coveringfor various articles of merchandize, whence its name, as beingused by dealers. After this comes the bark of the papyrus,the outer skin of which bears a strong resemblance to thebulrush, and is solely used for making ropes, and then onlyfor those which have to go into the water.<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span></p><p>All these various kinds of paper are made upon a table,moistened with Nile water; a liquid which, when in amuddy state, has the peculiar qualities of glue.<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> This tablebeing first inclined,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> the leaves of papyrus are laid upon itlengthwise, as long, indeed, as the papyrus will admit of, thejagged edges being cut off at either end; after which a crosslayer is placed over it, the same way, in fact, that hurdles aremade. When this is done, the leaves are pressed close together,and then dried in the sun; after which they are united to oneanother, the best sheets being always taken first, and the inferior ones added afterwards. There are never more thantwenty of these sheets to a roll.<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "holy" paper. The priests would not allow it to be sold, lest itmight be used for profane writing; but after it was once written upon, itwas easily procurable. The Romans were in the habit of purchasing itlargely in the latter state, and then washing off the writing, and using itas paper of the finest quality. Hence it received the name of "Augustus,"as representing in Latin its Greek name "hieraticus," or "sacred." Inlength of time it became the common impression, as here mentioned, thatthis name was given to it in honour of Augusus Cæsar.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Near the amphitheatre, probably, of Alexandria.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He alludes to Q. Remmius Fannius Palæmon, a famous grammarianof Rome, though originally a slave. Being mantumitted, he opened a schoolat Rome, which was resorted to by great numbers of pupils, notwithstanding his notoriously bad character lie appears to have established, also,a manufactory for paper at Rome. Suetonius, in his treatise on IllustriousGrammarians, gives a long account of him. He is supposed to have beenthe preceptor of Quintilian.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Fanniana.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In Lower Egypt.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ex vilioribus ramentis.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Of Alexandria, probably.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Shop-paper," or "paper of commerce."</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Otherwise, probably, the rope would not long hold together.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Fée remarks, that this is by no means the fact.
