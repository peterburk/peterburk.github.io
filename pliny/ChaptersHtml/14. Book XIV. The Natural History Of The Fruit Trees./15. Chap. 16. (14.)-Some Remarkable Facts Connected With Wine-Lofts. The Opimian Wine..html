THE OPIMIAN WINE.</head><p>The fact of the existence of the Opimian wine gives undoubted proof that there were wine-lofts,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and that wine wasracked off in the year of Rome 633, Italy being already aliveto the blessings she enjoyed. Still, however, the severalvarieties that are now so celebrated were not so in those days;and hence it is that all the wines that were grown at thatperiod have only the one general name of "Opimian" wines,from the then consul Opimius. So, too, for a long time afterwards, and, indeed, so late as the times of our grandfathers, thewines from beyond sea were held in the highest esteem, eventhough Falernian was already known, a fact which we learnfrom the line of the Comic writer,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> "I shall draw five cups ofThasian and two of Falernian."</p><p>P. Licinius Crassus, and L. Julius C¾sar, who were Censors in the year from the Building of the City 665, issued anedict forbidding the sale of either Greek or Aminean wine ata higher price than eight asses the quadrantal<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>Ñfor such, infact, are the exact words of the edict. Indeed, the Greekwines were so highly valued, that not more than a single cupwas served to a guest during the repast.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Apothecas. The " apothec¾" were rooms at the top of the house, inwhich the wines were placed for the purpose of seasoning. Sometimes acurrent of smoke was directed through them. They were quite distinctfrom the "cella vinaria," or "wine-cellar." The Opimian wine is mentioned in c. 4.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This writer is unknown.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or amphora.</p></body>
