The trunk of the tree issimilar to that of the poplar, and the leaves to those of the elm.It produces four crops in the year, and germinates the samenumber of times, but its green<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> fruit will not ripen unless anincision is made in it to let out the milky juice. The sweetness of the fruit and the appearance of the inside are in allrespects similar to those of the fig, and in size it is about aslarge as a sorb-apple.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This account is borrowed almost entirely from Theophrastus, Hist.Plant.
