Some writers think that this was the same as the lycoperdon andgeastrum of botanists, our putt-ball: while others take it to be the morel,the Morchella esculenta, Sprengel in the number. Fée is inclined to beof opinion that an edible mushroom is meant, but is quite at a loss toidentify it.</p></body>
