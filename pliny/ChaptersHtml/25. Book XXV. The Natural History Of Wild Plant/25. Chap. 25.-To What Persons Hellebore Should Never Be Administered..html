It is givenless frequently too to females than to males; and persons of atimorous disposition are recommended not to take it: the samealso, in cases where the viscera are ulcerated or tumefied, andmore particularly when the patient is afflicted with spitting ofblood, or with maladies of the side or fauces. Hellebore is applied, too, externally, with salted axle-grease, to morbid eruptionsof the body and suppurations of long standing: mixed withpolenta, it destroys rats and mice. The people of Gaul, whenhunting, tip their arrows with hellebore, taking care to cutaway the parts about the wound in the animal so slain: theflesh, they say, is all the more tender for it. Flies are destroyedwith white hellebore, bruised and sprinkled about a place withmilk: phthiriasis is also cured by the use of this mixture.<pb n="5102" /></p></div2></body>
