(13.)ÑDRAGONS.</head><p>®thiopia produces dragons, not so large as those of India, butstill, twenty cubits in length.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> The only thing that surprisesme is, how Juba came to believe that they have crests.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> The®thiopians are known as the Asach¾i, among whom theymost abound; and we are told, that on those coasts four orfive of them are found twisted and interlaced together like somany osiers in a hurdle, and thus setting sail, with theirheads erect, they are borne along upon the waves, to find better sources of nourishment in Arabia.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier states, that in India and America there are serpents of thegenus boa, or python, thirty feet or more in length. He observes, thatthere are various species of aquatic reptiles in the seas of India, but thatthey never swim twisted together, or with their heads elevated. ®liangives an account of the great size of the dragons in ®thiopia.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier remarks, that there are no serpents with crests on the head,and that Juba must have been thinking probably of some animal of thegenus lacertus, when he made this statement. We may here remark, thatthe "basiliscus," or "king of serpents," was said by the poets to havea crown on its head, as denoting its kingly rank. See c. 33 of this Book.</p></body>
