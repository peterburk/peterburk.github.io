The invention of it we owe to the islandof Chios, and still, at the present day, the most esteemed kindcomes from there; it derives its name from its being madewithout the help of the mill.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> Next to the amylum madewith three-month wheat, is that which is prepared from thelighter kinds of wheat. In making it, the grain is soaked in<pb n="4030" />fresh water, placed in wooden vessels; care being taken to keepit covered with the liquid, which is changed no less than fivetimes in the course of the day. If it can be changed at nightas well, it is all the better for it, the object being to let itimbibe the water gradually and equally. When it is quitæsoft, but before it turns sour, it is passed through linen cloth,or else wicker-work, after which it is poured out upon a tilecovered with leaven, and left to harden in the sun. Next tothe amylum of Chios, that of Crete is the most esteemed, andnext to that the Ægyptian. The tests of its goodness are itsbeing light and smooth: it should be used, too, while it isfresh. Cato,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> among our writers, has made mention of it.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Siligo.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot"><foreign lang="greek">)/Amulon.</foreign></p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">De Re Rust. c. 87.
