These animals also, when theyconceal themselves in their holes, afford a sure sign that thewind is about to change from north-east to south.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> When they<pb n="2309" />perceive the approach of the hunter, they draw in the headand feet, and all the lower part of the body, which is coveredby a thin and defenceless down only, and then roll themselvesup into the form of a ball, so that there is no way of takinghold of them but by their quills. When they are reducedto a state of desperation, they discharge a corrosive urine,which injures their skin and quills, as they are aware that itis for the sake of them that they are hunted. A skilful hunter,therefore, will only pursue them when they have just dischargedtheir urine. In this case the skin retains its value; whilein the other case, it becomes spoilt and easily torn, the quillsrotting and falling off, even though the animal should escapewith its life. For this reason it is that it never moistens itselfwith this poisonous fluid, except when reduced to the last stageof desperation; for it has a perfect hatred for its own venomousdistillation, and so careful is the animal, so determined to waittill the very last moment, that it is generally caught before ithas employed this means of defence.</p><p>They force it to unroll itself, by sprinkling warm water upon it, and then, suspended by one of its hind legs, it is leftto die of hunger; for there is no other mode of destroying it,without doing injury to its skin. This animal is not, as manyof us imagine, entirely useless to man. If it were not for thequills which it produces, the soft fleece of the sheep wouldhave been given in vain to mankind; for it is by means of itsskin, that our woollen cloth is dressed. From the monopolyof this article, great frauds and great profits have resulted;<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>there is no subject on which the senate has more frequentlypassed decrees, and there is not one of the Emperors, who hasnot received from the provinces complaints respecting it.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span><pb n="2310" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The faculty which these and other animals possess of foreseeing theweather and the future direction of the wind, is mentioned by Plutarch,and as existing especially in the hedgehog. It is also mentioned by Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. ix. c. 6; but it is not confined, as Pliny states, toits change in one direction only. It has been suggested by some commentators, that, by a slight alteration in the text, the statement may beextended to a change of the wind in either direction, Lemaire, vol. iii. p.468.—B.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The teasel, or carding thistle, is now used for this purpose; as alsoiron wires, crooked and sharpened at the point. Not a single quill, probably of the hedgehog, is now used in the manufacture of cloth.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Dalechamps suggests that these complaints were probably to theeffect that thistles and thorns were employed instead of the quills of thehedgehog; that the skin of the hedgehog was brought to market in a badstate; and again, that the rich merchants were in the habit of buying themup, and forestalling the market. Hardouin quotes an edict of the EmperorZeno against monopolies of hedgehogs and carding materials, if, indeed,that is the meaning of the word "pectinum."</p></body>
