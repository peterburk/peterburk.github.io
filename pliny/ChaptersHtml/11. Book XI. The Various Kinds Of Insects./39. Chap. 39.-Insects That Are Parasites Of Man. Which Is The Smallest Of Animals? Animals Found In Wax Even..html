It was throughsuch vermin as this that the Dictator Sylla,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and Aleman,one of the most famous of the Grecian poets, met their deaths.These insects infest birds too, and are apt to kill the pheasant,unless it takes care to bathe itself in the dust. Of the animalsthat are covered with hair, it is supposed that the ass and thesheep are the only ones that are exempt from these vermin.They are produced, also, in certain kinds of cloth, and moreparticularly those made of the wool of sheep which have beenkilled by the wolf. I find it stated, also, by authors, thatsome kinds of water<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> which we use for bathing are more productive of these parasites than others. Even wax is found toproduce mites, which are supposed to be the very smallest ofall living creatures. Other insects, again, are engenderedfrom filth, acted upon by the rays of the sun-these fleas arecalled "petauristæ,"<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> from the activity which they displayin their hind legs. Others, again, are produced with wings,from the moist dust that is found lying in holes and corners.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He alludes to the Morbus pediculosus.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle says, in the corresponding passage, Hist.
