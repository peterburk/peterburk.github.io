<div2 type="chapter" n="77" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 77.—THE DIAPHRAGM. THE NATURE OF LAUGHTER.</head><p>The entrails of serpents and lizards are of remarkable length.It is related that—a most fortunate omen—Cæcina of Volaterræbeheld two dragons arising from the entrails of the victim;and this will not be at all incredible, if we are ready to believethat while King Pyrrhus was sacrificing, the day upon whichhe died, the heads of the victims, on being cut off, crawledalong the ground and licked up their own blood. In man, theentrails are separated from the lower part of the viscera by acertain membrane, which is called the " præcordia,"<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> becauseit is extended in front of the heart; the Greeks have given itthe name of " phrenes." All the principal viscera have beenenclosed by Nature, in her prudent foresight, in their own peculiar membranes, just like so many sheaths, in fact. With reference to the diaphragm, there was a peculiar reason for thiswise provision of Nature, its proximity to the guts, and thechances that the food might possibly intercept the respiration.It is to this organ that is attributed quick and ready wit, andhence it is that it has no fleshy parts, but is composed of finesinews and membranes. This part is also the chief seat ofgaiety of mind, a fact which is more particularly proved bythe titillation of the arm-holes, to which the midriff extends;<pb n="3071" />indeed, in no part of the body is the skin more fine; for thisreason it is, also, that we experience such peculiar pleasure inscratching the parts in its vicinity. Hence it is, that in battlesand gladiatorial combats, many persons have been known tobe pierced through the midriff, and to die in the act oflaughing.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or diaphragm; from "præ," "before," and "cor," the " heart."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">With Sardonic laughter, as Hardouin remarks.</p></body>
