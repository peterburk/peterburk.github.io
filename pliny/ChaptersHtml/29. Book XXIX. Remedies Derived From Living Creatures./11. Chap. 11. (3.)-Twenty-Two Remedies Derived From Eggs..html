<div2 type="chapter" n="11" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 11. (3.)—TWENTY-TWO REMEDIES DERIVED FROM EGGS.</head><p>There is a considerable affinity also between wool and eggs,which are applied together as a frontal to the forehead by wayof cure for defluxions of the eyes. Wool, however, is notrequired for this purpose to have been dressed with radicula,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>the only thing requisite to be combined with it being thewhite of an egg and powdered frankincense. The white of anegg, also applied by itself, arrests defluxions of the eyes, and hasa cooling effect upon inflammations of those organs: some, however, prefer mixing saffron with it, and employ it as an ingredient in eye-salves, in place of water. For ophthalmia in infantsthere is hardly any remedy to be found, except white of eggmixed with fresh butter. Eggs beaten up with oil, are verysoothing for erysipelas, beet leaves being laid on the liniment.</p><p>White of egg, mixed with pounded gum ammoniac, is usedas a bandoline for arranging the hairs of the eyelids; and, incombination with pine-nuts and a little honey, it forms aliniment for the removal of pimples on the face. If the faceis well rubbed with it, it will never be sun-burnt. If, themoment the flesh has been scalded, an egg is applied, no blisters will form: some persons, however, mix with it barley-meal and a little salt. In cases of ulceration formed by burns,there is nothing better than parched barley and hogs' lard,mixed with the white of an egg. The same mixture is alsoused as an application for diseases of the rectum, in infantseven, and in cases, too, when there is procidence of those parts.For the cure of chaps upon the feet, white of eggs is boiled,with two denarii of white lead, an equal quantity of litharge,a little myrrh, and some wine. For the cure of erysipelas theyuse the whites of three eggs with amylum:<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> it is said, too,that white of egg has the effect of knitting wounds and ofexpelling urinary calculi. The yolk of eggs boiled hard,applied in woman's milk with a little saffron and honey, hasa soothing effect upon pains in the eyes. The yolk is appliedalso to the eyes in wool, mixed with honied wine and oil of<pb n="5386" />roses; or else mixed with ground parsley-seed and polenta, andapplied with honied wine. The yolk of a single egg, swallowedraw by itself without being allowed to touch the teeth, isremarkably good for cough, defluxions of the chest, and irritations of the fauces. It is used, too, both internally and externally, in a raw state, as a sovereign cure for the sting of thehæmorrhoïs;<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and it is highly beneficial for the kidneys, forirritations and ulcerations of the bladder, and for bloody expectorations. For dysentery, the yolks of five eggs are taken rawin one semi-sextarius of wine, mixed with the ashes of the shells,poppy-juice, and wine.</p><p>For cœliac fluxes, it is recommended to take the yolks ofeggs, with like proportions of pulpy raisins and pomegranaterind, in equal quantities, for three consecutive days; or elseto follow another method, and take the yolks of three eggs,with three ounces of old bacon and honey, and three cyathi ofold wine; the whole being beaten up to the consistency ofhoney, and taken in water, when needed, in pieces the size ofa hazel nut. In some cases, too, the yolks of three eggs arefried in oil, the whole of the egg having been steeped a daypreviously in vinegar. It is in this way that eggs are used forthe treatment of spleen diseases; but for spitting of blood, theyshould be taken with three cyathi of must. Yolk of egg is used,too, for the cure of bruises of long standing, in combinationwith bulbs and honey. Boiled and taken in wine, yolks ofeggs arrest menstruation: applied raw with oil or wine, theydispel inflations of the uterus. Mixed with goose-grease andoil of roses, they are useful for crick in the neck; and theyare hardened over the fire, and applied warm, for the cure ofmaladies of the rectum. For condylomata, eggs are used incombination with oil of roses; and for the treatment of burns,they are hardened in water, and set upon hot coals till theshells are burnt, the yellow being used as a liniment with oilof roses.</p><p>Eggs become entirely transformed into yolk, on being removed after the hen has sat upon them for three days; inwhich state they are known by the name of "sitista."<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> Thechicks that are found within the shell are used for strengthen-<pb n="5387" />ing a disordered stomach, being eaten with half a nut-gall,and no other food taken for the next two hours. They aregiven also for dysentery, boiled in the egg with one semisexta-rius of astringent wine, and an equal quantity of olive oil andpolenta. The pellicle that lines the shell is used, either rawor boiled, for the cure of cracked lips; and the shell itself,reduced to ashes, is taken in wine for discharges of blood: caremust be taken, however, to burn it without the pellicle. Inthe same way, too, a dentifrice is prepared. The ashes of theshell, applied topically with myrrh, arrest menstruation whenin excess. So remarkably strong is the shell of an egg, thatif it is set upright, no force or weight can break it, unless aslight inclination be made to one side or other of the circumference. Eggs taken whole in wine, with rue, dill, and cum-min, facilitate parturition. Used with oil and cedar-resin,they remove itch and prurigo, and, applied in combination withcyclaminos,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> they are remedial for running ulcers of the head.For purulent expectorations and spitting of blood, a raw eggis taken, warmed with juice of cut-leek and an equal quantityof Greek honey. For coughs, eggs are administered, boiledand beaten up with honey, or else raw, with raisin wine and anequal quantity of olive oil. For diseases of the male organs,an injection is made, of an egg, three cyathi of raisin wine,and half an ounce of amylum,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> the mixture being used immediately after the bath. Where injuries have been inflicted byserpents, boiled eggs are used as a liniment, beaten up withnasturtium.</p><p>In what various ways eggs are used as food is well knownto all, passing downwards, however swollen the throat maybe, and warming the parts as they pass. Eggs, too, are theonly diet which, while it affords nutriment in sickness, doesnot load the stomach, possessing at the same moment all theadvantages both of food and drink. We have already<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> stated,that the shell of an egg becomes soft when steeped in vinegar:it is by the aid of eggs thus prepared, and kneaded up withmeal into bread, that patients suffering from the cœliac fluxare often restored to strength. Some, however, think it a betterplan to roast the eggs, when thus softened, in a shallow pan;a method, by the aid of which, they arrest not only looseness of<pb n="5388" />the bowels, but excessive menstruation as well. In cases,again, where the discharges are greatly in excess, eggs aretaken raw, with meal, in water. The yolks, too, are employedalone, boiled hard in vinegar and roasted with ground pepper,when wanted to arrest diarrhœa.</p><p>For dysentery, there is a sovereign remedy, prepared in thefollowing manner: an egg is emptied into a new earthen vessel,which done, in order that all the proportions may be equal,fill the shell, first with honey, then with oil, and then withvinegar; beat them up together, and thoroughly incorporatethem: the better the quality of the several ingredients, themore efficacious the mixture will be. Others, again, insteadof oil and vinegar, use the same proportions of red resin andwine. There is also another way of making up this prepara-tion: the proportion of oil, and of that only, remains the same,and to it they add two sixtieth parts of a denarius of thevegetable which we have spoken of under the name of "rhus,"<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>and five oboli of honey. All these ingredients are boiled downtogether, and no food is eaten by the patient till the end offour hours after taking the mixture. Many persons, too, havea cure for griping pains in the bowels, by beating up two eggswith four cloves of garlick, and administering them, warmedin one semi-sextarius of wine.</p><p>Not to omit anything in commendation of eggs, I wouldhere add that glair of egg, mixed with quicklime, unitesbroken<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> glass. Indeed, so great is the efficacy of the substanceof an egg, that wood dipped in it will not take fire, and clothwith which it has come in contact will not ignite.<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> On thisoccasion, however, it is only of the eggs of poultry that I havebeen speaking, though those of the various other birds as wellare possessed of many useful properties, as I shall have tomention on the appropriate occasions.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xix. c. 1, B. xxiv. c 58, and B. xxv. c. 21.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B, xviii. c. 17.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xx. c. 23.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hermolaüs suggests "schista," "divided," and Dalechamps proposes"synchyta," "mixed."
