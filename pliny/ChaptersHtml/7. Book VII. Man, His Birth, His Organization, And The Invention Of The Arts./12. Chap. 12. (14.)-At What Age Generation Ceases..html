(14.)ÑAT WHAT AGE GENERATION CEASES.</head><p>Women cease to bear children at their fiftieth year, and,with the greater part of them, the monthly discharge ceases atthe age of forty. But with respect to the male sex, it is awell-known fact, that King Masinissa, when he was past hiseighty-sixth year, had a son born to him, whom he namedMetimanus,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and that Cato the Censor, after he had completedhis eightieth year, had a son by the daughter of his client,Salonius: a circumstance from which, while the descendantsof his other sons were surnamed Liciniani, those of this sonwere called Saloniani, of whom Cato of Utica was one.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> It isequally well known, too, that L. Volusius Saturninus,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> wholately died while prefect of the city, had a son when he waspast his seventy-second year,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> by Cornelia, a member of thefamily of the Scipios, Volusius Saturninus, who was afterwardsconsul. Among the lower classes of the people, we not uncommonly meet with men who become the fathers of childrenafter the age of seventy-five.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This fact is mentioned by Valerius Maximus, B. viii. c. 13. Thereis some variation in the spelling of the name of the son of Masinissa;Solinus calls him Mathumannus.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hardouin gives a detailed account of the children of Cato, by whichit appears that the Licinian branch descended from the issue by his wifeLicinia, and the Saloniani, of whom Cato of Utica was one, from his sonSalonianus, by his second wife, Salonia.ÑB</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Volusius Saturninus is again mentioned in the 49th Chapter, as a re-markable instance of longevity; also by Tacitus, B. xiii. c. 30.ÑB</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This reading seems preferable to sixty-second, adopted by Sillig; asthere would be nothing very remarkable in a man becoming a father whensixty-two years of age.</p></body>
