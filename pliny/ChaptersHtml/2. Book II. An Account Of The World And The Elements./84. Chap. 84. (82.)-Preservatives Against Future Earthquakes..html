And, inthe same town, those parts that are excavated<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> are safer thanthe other parts, as is understood to be the case at Naples inItaly, the part of it which is solid being more liable to injury.Arched buildings are also the most safe, also the angles ofwalls, the shocks counteracting each other; walls made ofbrick also suffer less from the shocks<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>. There is also a great<pb n="1115" />difference in the nature of the motions<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, where various motions areexperienced. It is the safest when it vibrates andcauses a creaking in the building, and where it swells andrises upwards, and settles with an alternate motion. It isalso harmless when the buildings coming together buttagainst each other in opposite directions, for the motionscounteract each other. A movement like the rolling of wavesis dangerous, or when the motion is impelled in one direction.The tremors cease when the vapour bursts out<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>; but ifthey do not soon cease, they continue for forty days; generally,indeed, for a longer time: some have lasted even forone or two years.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"In iisdem;" "Iidem, inquit, putei inclusum terra spiritum liberomeatu emittentes, terræ motus avertunt."
