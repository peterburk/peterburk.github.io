Agrippa, a man who was naturally moreattached to rustic simplicity than to refinement. Still, however,we have a magnificent oration of his, and one well worthy ofthe greatest of our citizens, on the advantage of exhibiting inpublic all pictures and statues; a practice which would havebeen far preferable to sending them into banishment at ourcountry-houses. Severe as he was in his tastes, he paid thepeople of Cyzicus twelve hundred thousand sesterces for twopaintings, an Ajax and a Venus. He also ordered small paintingsto be set in marble in the very hottest part of his WarmBaths;<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> where they remained until they were removed a shorttime since, when the building was repaired.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. vii. c. 39.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We have had this Temple referred to in B. ii. c. 23, B. vii. c. 39,B. viii. c. 64, and B. ix. c. 57: it is again mentioned in the fortieth Chapterof this Book, and in B. xxxvii. c. 5.—B.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In the "Vaporarium," namely.—B.
