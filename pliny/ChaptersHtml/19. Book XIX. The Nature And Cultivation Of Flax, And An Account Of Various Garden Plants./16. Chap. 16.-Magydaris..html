It grows in the countries adjacent to Syria,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>but is not to be found in the regions of Cyrenaica. There<pb n="4148" />grows also upon Mount Parnassus,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> in great abundance, a plantto which some persons give the name of "laserpitium:" bymeans of all these varieties, adulterations are effected of a production that is held in the highest esteem for its salutaryqualities and its general usefulness. The chief proofs of itsgenuineness consist in its colour, which ought to be slightlyred without, and when broken quite white and transparentwithin; the drops of it, too, should melt very rapidly on theapplication of spittle. It is extensively employed for medi-cinal purposes.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The whole of this paragraph has been borrowed from Theophrastus,Hist.
