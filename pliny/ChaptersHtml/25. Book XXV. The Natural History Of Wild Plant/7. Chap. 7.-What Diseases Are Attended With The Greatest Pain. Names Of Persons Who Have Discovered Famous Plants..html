<div2 type="chapter" n="7" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 7.â€”WHAT DISEASES ARE ATTENDED WITH THE GREATEST PAIN.NAMES OF PERSONS WHO HAVE DISCOVERED FAMOUS PLANTS.</head><p>In former times there was a sort of ambition, as it were, ofadopting plants, by bestowing upon them one's name, a thingthat has been done before now by kings even, as we shall haveoccasion to show:<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> so desirable a thing did it appear to havemade the discovery of some plant, and thus far to have contributed to the benefit of mankind. At the present day, however,it is far from impossible that there may be some who willlook upon these researches of ours as frivolous even, so distasteful to a life of ease and luxury are the very things which sogreatly conduce to our welfare.</p><p>Still, however, it will be only right to mention in the firstplace those plants the discoverers of which are known, theirvarious properties being classified<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> according to the severalmaladies for the treatment of which they are respectively employed: in taking a review of which one cannot do otherwisethan bewail the unhappy lot of mankind, subject as it is, inaddition to chances and changes, and those new afflictions whichevery hour is bringing with it, to thousands of diseases whichmenace the existence of each mortal being. It would seemalmost an act of folly to attempt to determine which of thesediseases is attended with the most excruciating pain, seeingthat every one is of opinion that the malady with which forthe moment he himself is afflicted, is the most excruciatingand insupportable. The general experience, however, of thepresent age has come to the conclusion, that the most agonizingtorments are those attendant upon strangury, resulting fromcalculi in the bladder; next to them, those arising from maladies of the stomach; and in the third place, those caused bypains and affections of the head; for it is more generally in<pb n="5087" />these cases, we find, and not in others, that patients aretempted to commit suicide.</p><p>For my own part, I am surprised that the Greek authorshave gone so far as to give a description of noxious plantseven; in using which term, I wish it to be understood thatI do not mean the poisonous plants merely; for such is ourtenure of life that death is often a port of refuge to even thebest of men. We meet too, with one case of a somewhatsimilar nature, where M. Varro speaks of Servius Clodius,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> amember of the Equestrian order, being so dreadfully tormentedwith gout, that he had his legs rubbed all over with poisons,the result of which was, that from that time forward all sensation, equally with all pain, was deadened in those parts of hisbody. But what excuse, I say, can there be for making theworld acquainted with plants, the only result of the use ofwhich is to derange the intellect, to produce abortion, and tocause numerous other effects equally pernicious? So far as I amconcerned, I shall describe neither abortives nor philtres,bearing in mind, as I do, that Lucullus, that most celebratedgeneral, died of the effects of a philtre.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> Nor shall I speakof other ill-omened devices of magic, unless it be to givewarning against them, or to expose them, for I most emphatically condemn all faith and belief in them. It will suffice forme, and I shall have abundantly done my duty, if I point outthose plants which were made for the benefit of mankind, andthe properties of which have been discovered in the lapse oftime.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In c. 33, <hi rend="ital">et seq.,</hi> of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In the next Book.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See the case of M.
