<div2 type="chapter" n="32" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 32.—THAT THE SAME KINDS ARE NOT EVERYWHEREEQUALLY ESTEEMED.</head><p>There is this also in the nature of fish, that some are morehighly esteemed in one place, and some in another; such, forinstance, as the coracinus<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> in Egypt, the zeus,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> also called thefaber,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> at Gades, the salpa,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> in the vicinity of Ebusus,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> whichis considered elsewhere an unclean fish, and can nowhere<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> bethoroughly cooked, wherever found, without being first beatenwith a stick: in Aquitania, again, the river salmon<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> is preferred to all the fish that swim in the sea.<pb n="2405" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The bolty of the modern Egyptians, as previously mentioned.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or Jove-fish. Cuvier says that Gillius has applied the name of"faber" to the dory, or fish of Saint Peter, and has stated that the Dalmatians, who call it the "forga," pretend that they can find in its bones allthe instruments of a forge. After him, other modern naturalists have calledthe same fish Zeus faber; but nothing, Cuvier says, goes to prove that thedory is the fish so called by the ancients. The epithet even of "rare,"given to it by Ovid, Halieut. 1. 112, is far from applicable to the dory,which is common enough in the Mediterranean. If, indeed, the <foreign lang="greek">xalke/us</foreign>of the Greeks were the same as the "faber," as, indeed, we have reason tosuppose, it would be something in favour of the dory, as Athenæus, B. vii.,says that the <foreign lang="greek">xalke/us</foreign> is of a round shape: but then, on the other hand,Oppian, Halicut. B. v. 1. 135, ranks it among the rock-fish which feed nearrocks with herbage on them; while the dory is found only in the deep sea.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "blacksmith."</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier says that this fish has still the same name in Italy; that it iscalled the "saupe" in Provence, and the "vergadelle" in Languedoc, beingthe Sparus salpa of Linnæus; and that it still answers to all the ancientcharacteristics of the salpa, eating grass and filling its stomach, and havingnumerous red lines upon the body. It is common, and bad eating, but isno better at Ivica, the ancient Ebusus, than anywhere else. M. De laRoche, when describing the fishes of that island, says expressly that theflesh of the saupe is but very little esteemed there. Ovid, Halieut. 1. 122,speaks of it as "deservedly held in little esteem."</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. iii. c. 11.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Neither at Ebusus nor anywhere else.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hardouin remarks, that Pliny and Ausonius are the only Latin writersthat mention this fish; while not one among the Greeks speaks of it. Itwas probably a native of regions too far to the north for them to knowmuch about it. In this country it holds the same rank that the scarus andthe mullet seem to have held at the Roman tables.</p></body>
