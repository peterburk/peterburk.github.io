<div2 type="chapter" n="58" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 58. (14.)—REMEDIES FOR BOWEL COMPLAINTS.</head><p>To arrest looseness of the bowels, deer's blood is used; theashes also of deer's horns; the liver of a wild boar, taken freshand without salt, in wine; a swine's liver roasted, or that of ahe-goat, boiled in five semisextarii of wine; a hare's rennetboiled, in quantities the size of a chick-pea, in wine, or, ifthere are symptoms of fever, in water. To this last somepersons add nut-galls, while others, again, content themselveswith hare's blood boiled by itself in milk. Ashes; too, ofburnt horse-dung are taken in water for this purpose; or elseashes of the part of an old bull's horn which lies nearest theroot, sprinkled in water; the blood, too, of a he-goat boiledupon charcoal; or a decoction made from a goat's hide boiledwith the hair on.</p><p>For relaxing the bowels a horse's rennet is used, or else theblood, marrow, or liver of a she-goat. A similar effect is produced by applying a wolf's gall to the navel, with elaterium;<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>by taking mares' milk, goats' milk with salt and honey, or ashe-goat's gall with juice of cyclaminos,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and a little alum—inwhich last case some prefer adding nitre and water to themixture. Bull's gall, too, is used for a similar purpose, beatenup with wormwood and applied in the form of a suppository; orbutter is taken, in considerable doses.</p><p>Cœliac affections and dysentery are cured by taking cow'sliver; ashes of deer's horns, a pinch in three fingers swallowedin water; hare's rennet, kneaded up in bread, or, if there isany discharge of blood, taken with polenta;<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> or else boar's<pb n="5347" />dung, swine's dung, or hare's dung, reduced to ashes andmixed with mulled wine. Among the remedies, also, for thecœliac flux and dysentery, veal broth is reckoned, a remedy verycommonly used. If the patient takes asses' milk for thesecomplaints, it will be all the better if honey is added; and noless efficacious for either complaint are the ashes of asses' dungtaken in wine; or else polea, the substance above<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>-mentioned.In such cases, even when attended with a discharge of blood,we find a horse's rennet recommended, by some persons knownas "hippace;" ashes of burnt horse-dung; horses' teethpounded; and boiled cows' milk. In cases of dysentery, it isrecommended to add a little honey; and, for the cure of griping pains, ashes of deer's horns, bull's gall mixed with cum-min, or the flesh of a gourd, should be applied to the navel.For both complaints new cheese made of cows' milk is used,as an injection; butter also, in the proportion of four semisextarii to two ounces of turpentine, or else employed with a decoction of mallows or with oil of roses. Veal-suet or beef-suetis also given, and the marrow of those animals is boiled withmeal, a little wax, and some oil, so as to form a sort of pottage.This marrow, too, is kneaded up with bread for a similar purpose; or else goats' milk is used, boiled down to one half. Incases, too, where there are gripings in the bowels, wine of thefirst running<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> is administered. For the last-named pains, somepersons are of opinion that it is a sufficient remedy to takea single dose of hare's rennet in mulled wine; though othersagain, who are more distrustful, are in the habit of applying aliniment to the abdomen, made of goats' blood, barley-meal,and resin.</p><p>For all defluxions of the bowels it is recommended to applysoft cheese, and for cœliac affections and dysentery old cheese,powdered, one cyathus of cheese being taken in three cyathi ofordinary wine. Goats' blood is boiled down with the marrowof those animals for the cure of dysentery; and the cœliac fluxis effectually treated with the roasted liver of a she-goat, or,what is still better, the liver of a he-goat boiled in astringentwine, and administered in the drink, or else applied to the navelwith oil of myrtle. Some persons boil down the liver in threesextarii of water to half a sextarius, and then add rue to it.<pb n="5348" />The milt of a he or she-goat is sometimes roasted for this purpose, or the suet of a he-goat is incorporated in bread bakedupon the ashes; the fat, too, of a she-goat, taken from the kidneysmore particularly, is used. This last, however, must be takenby itself and swallowed immediately, being generally recommended to be taken in water moderately cool. Some persons,too, boil goats' suet in water, with a mixture of polenta, cummin, anise, and vinegar; and for the cure of cœliac affections,they rub the abdomen with a decoction of goats' dung andhoney.</p><p>For both the cœliac flux and dysentery, kid's rennet isemployed, taken in myrtle wine in pieces the size of a bean,or else kid's blood, prepared in the form of a dish known bythe name of "sanguiculus."<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> For dysentery an injection isemployed, made of bull glue dissolved in warm water. Flatulency is dispelled by a decoction of calf's dung in wine. Forintestinal affections deer's rennet is highly recommended,boiled with beef and lentils, and taken with the food; hare'sfur, also reduced to ashes and boiled with honey; or boiledgoat's milk, taken with a small quantity of mallows and somesalt; if rennet is added, the remedy will be all the more effectual. Goat suet, taken in any kind of broth, is possessed ofsimilar virtues, care being taken to swallow cold water immediately after. The ashes of a kid's thighs are said to be marvellously efficacious for intestinal hernia; as also hare's dung,boiled with honey, and taken daily in pieces the size of a bean;indeed, these remedies are said to have proved effectual in caseswhere a cure has been quite despaired of. The broth too,made from a goat's head, boiled with the hair on, is highlyrecommended.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xx. c. 2.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxv. c. 67.
