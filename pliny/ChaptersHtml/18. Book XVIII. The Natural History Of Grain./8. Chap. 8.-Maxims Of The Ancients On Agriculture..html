<div2 type="chapter" n="8" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 8.—MAXIMS OF THE ANCIENTS ON AGRICULTURE.</head><p>In what way, then, can land be most profitably cultivated?Why, in the words of our agricultural oracles, "by makinggood out of bad." But here it is only right that we should saya word in justification of our forefathers, who in their preceptson this subject had nothing else in view but the benefit ofmankind: for when they use the term "bad" here, they onlymean to say that which costs the smallest amount of money.The principal object with them was in all cases to cut downexpenses to the lowest possible sum; and it was in this spiritthat they made the enactments which pronounced it criminalfor a person who had enjoyed a triumph, to be in possession,among his other furniture, of ten pounds' weight of silverplate: which permitted a man, upon the death of his farmsteward, to abandon all his victories, and return to the cultivation of his lands—such being the men the culture of whosefarms the state used to take upon itself; and thus, while theyled our armies, did the senate act as their steward.</p><p>It was in the same spirit, too, that those oracles of ourshave given utterance to these other precepts, to the effect thathe is a bad agriculturist who has to buy what his farm mighthave supplied him with; that the man is a bad manager whodoes in the day-time what he might have done in the night,except, indeed, when the state of the weather does not allow<pb n="4017" />it; that he is a worse manager still, who does on a work-daywhat he might have done on a feast-day;<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> but that he is thevery worst of all, who works under cover in fine weather, in-stead of labouring in the fields.</p><p>I cannot refrain from taking the present opportunity ofquoting one illustration afforded us by ancient times, fromwhich it will be found that it was the usage in those days tobring before the people even questions connected with thevarious methods employed in agriculture, and will be seen inwhat way men were accustomed to speak out in their owndefence. C. Furius Chresimus, a freedman, having found himself able, from a very small piece of land, to raise far moreabundant harvests than his neighbours could from the largestfarms, became the object of very considerable jealousy amongthem, and was accordingly accused of enticing away the cropsof others by the practice of sorcery. Upon this, a day wasnamed by Spurius Calvinus, the curule ædile, for his appearance. Apprehensive of being condemned, when the questioncame to be put to the vote among the tribes, he had all hisimplements of husbandry brought into the Forum, togetherwith his farm servants, robust, Well-conditioned, and well-cladpeople, Piso says. The iron tools were of first-rate quality,the mattocks were stout and strong, the plough-shares ponderous and substantial, and the oxen sleek and in prime condition. When all this had been done, "Here, Roman citizens," said he, "are my implements of magic; but it is impossible for me to exhibit to your view, or to bring into thisForum, those midnight toils of mine, those early watchingsthose sweats, and those fatigues." Upon this, by the unanimous voice of the people, he was immediately acquitted.Agriculture, in fact, depends upon the expenditure of labourand exertion; and hence it is that the ancients were in thehabit of saying, that it is the eye of the master that does moretowards fertilizing a field than anything else.</p><p>We shall give the rest of these precepts in their appropriateplaces, according as we find them adapted to each variety ofcultivation; but in the meantime we must not omit some of ageneral nature, which here recur to our recollection, and more<pb n="4018" />particularly that maxim of Cato, as profitable as it is humane:"Always act in such away as to secure the love of your neighbours." He then proceeds to state his reasons for giving thisadvice, but it appears to me that no one surley can entertainthe slightest doubt upon the subject. One of the very firstrecommendations that he gives is to take every care that thefarm servants are kept in good condition.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> It is a maximuniversally agreæd upon in agriculture, that nothing must bedone too late; and again, that everything must be done at itsproper season; while there is a third precept, which remindsus that opportunities lost can never be regained. The male-diction uttered by Cato against rotten ground has been treatedof at some length already;<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> but there is another precept whichhe is never tired of repeating, "Whatever can be done by thehelp of the ass, will cost the least money."</p><p>Fern will be sure to die at the end of a couple of years, ifyou prevent it from putting forth leaves; the most efficient method of ensuring this is to beat the branches with a stick whilethey are in bud; for then the juices that drop from it will killthe roots.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> It is said, too, that fern will not spring up againif it is pulled up by the roots about the turn of the summersolstice, or if the stalks are cut with the edge of a reed, or if itis turned up with a plough-share with a reed placed<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> upon it.In the same way, too, we are told that reeds may be effectuallyploughed up, if care is taken to place a stalk of fern upon theshare. A field infested with rushes should be turned up withthe spade, or, if the locality is stony, with a two-prongedmattock: overgrown shrubs are best removed by fire. Whereground is too moist, it is an advantageous plan to cut trenchesin it and so drain it; where the soil is cretaceous, these trenchesshould be left open; and where it is loose, they should bestrengthened with a hedge to prevent them from falling in.When these drains are made on a declivity, they should havea layer of gutter tiles at the bottom, or else house tiles with theface upwards: in some cases, too, they should be covered<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span><pb n="4019" />with earth, and made to run into others of a larger size andwider; the bottom, also, should, if possible, have a coating ofstones or of gravel. The openings, too, should be strengthenedwith two stones placed on either side, and another laid uponthe top. Democritus has described a method of rooting up aforest, by first macerating the flower of the lupine<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> for one dayin the juice of hemlock, and then watering the roots of thetrees with it.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Virgil, Georg.
