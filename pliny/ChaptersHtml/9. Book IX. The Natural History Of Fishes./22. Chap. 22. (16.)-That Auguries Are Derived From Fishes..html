(16.)ÑTHAT AUGURIES ARE DERIVED FROM FISHES.</head><p>Auguries are also derived from this department of Nature,and fishes afford presages of coming events. While Augustus<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>was walking on the sea-shore, during the time of the Sicilianwar, a fish leapt out of the sea, and fell at his feet. The diviners, who were consulted, stated that this was a proof thatthose would fall beneath the feet of C¾sar who at that momentwere in possession of the seas-it was just at this time thatSextus Pompeius had adopted<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> Neptune as his father, so elatedwas he with his successes by sea.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In confirmation of this, Suetonius says, "The day before Augustusfought the sea-battle off Sicily, while he was walking on the sea-shore, afish leapt out of the sea and fell at his feet."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Appian tells us, B. v., that Sextus Pompeius, on gaining some successes against Augustus at sea, caused himself to be called the "Son ofNeptune," as having been adopted by that divinity. There is also a coinof Pompey extant, which attests that he adopted the surname of "Neptunius."</p></body>
