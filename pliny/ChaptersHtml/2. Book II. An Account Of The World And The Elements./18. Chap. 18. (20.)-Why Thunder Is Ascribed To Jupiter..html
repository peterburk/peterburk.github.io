<div2 type="chapter" n="18" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 18. (20.)â€”WHY THUNDER IS ASCRIBED TO JUPITER.</head><p>It is not generally known, what has been discovered bymen who are the most eminent for their learning, in consequence of their assiduous observations of the heavens, thatthe fires which fall upon the earth, and receive the name ofthunder-bolts, proceed from the three superior stars<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>, butprincipally from the one which is situated in the middle. Itmay perhaps depend on the superabundance of moisture fromthe superior orbit communicating with the heat from theinferior, which are expelled in this manner<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>; and hence itis commonly said, the thunder-bolts are darted by Jupiter.And as, in burning wood, the burnt part is cast off with acrackling noise, so does the star throw off this celestial fire,bearing the omens of future events, even the part which is<pb n="1052" />thrown off not losing its divine operation. And this takesplace more particularly when the air is in an unsettled state,either because the moisture which is then collected excitesthe greatest quantity of fire, or because the air is disturbed,as if by the parturition of the pregnant star.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"siderum."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The hypothesis of the author is, that the excess of moisture in theorbit of Saturn, and the excess of heat in that of Mars, unite in the orbitof Jupiter and are discharged in the form of thunder.</p></body>
