Hence it is thatin small hamlets there are never more than two<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> pairs tobe found; and in the neighbourhood of Crannon, in Thessaly,never more than one, the parents always quitting the spot togive place to their offspring. There have been some differencesobserved between this and the bird last mentioned. Ravensbreed before the summer solstice, and continue in bad health forsixty days—Being afflicted with a continual thirst more particularly—Before the ripening of the fig in autumn; while, on theother hand, the crow is attacked by disease after that period.The raven lays, at most, but five eggs. It is a vulgar belief,that they couple, or else lay, by means of the beak; and that,consequently, if a pregnant woman happens to eat a raven'segg, she will be delivered by the mouth. It is also believed, that if the eggs are even so much as brought beneaththe roof, a difficult labour will be the consequence. Aristotledenies it, and assures us in all good faith that there is no moretruth in this than in the same story about the ibis in Egypt;<pb n="2492" />he says that it is nothing else but that same sort of billing thatis so often seen in pigeons.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> Ravens are the only birds thatseem to have any comprehension of the meaning of theirauspices; for when the guests of Medus<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> were assassinated,they all took their departure from Peloponnesus and the regionof Attica.
