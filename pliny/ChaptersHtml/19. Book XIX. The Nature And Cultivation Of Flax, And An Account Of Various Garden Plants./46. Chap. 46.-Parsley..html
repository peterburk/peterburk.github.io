<div2 type="chapter" n="46" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 46.ÑPARSLEY.</head><p>Parsley is sown immediately after the vernal equinox, theseed being lightly beaten<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> first in a mortar. It is thoughtthat, by doing this, the parsley will be all the more crisped,or else by taking care to beat it down when sown with a rolleror the feet. It is a peculiarity of this plant, that it changescolour: it has the honour, in Achaia, of forming the wreathof the victors in the sacred contests of the Nemean Games.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">For the purpose of separating the seeds, which are slightly joined together; and of disengaging a portion of the perisperm. At the presentday this is not done, for fear of bursting the kernel of the seed.</p></body>
