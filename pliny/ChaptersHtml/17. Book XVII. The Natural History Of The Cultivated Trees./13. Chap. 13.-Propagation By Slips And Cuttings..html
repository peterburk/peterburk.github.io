The quince, however, if planted inthis way will degenerate,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and it has been consequently founda better plan to cut slips and plant them: a method whichwas at first adopted for making hedges, with the elder, thequince, and the bramble, but came afterwards to be applied tocultivated trees, such as the poplar, the alder, and the willow,which last will grow if even the slip is planted upside down.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>In the case of cuttings, they are planted at once in the spotwhich it is intended they should occupy: but before we passon to the other methods of propagation, it seems as well tomention the care that should be expended upon making seedplots.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Perna." This method of reproduction is still adopted, but it is notto be recommended, as the young tree, before it throws out a root, is liableto be overthrown by high winds. Virgil mentions it, Georg. ii. 23.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Palladius only says that the growth of the quince in such case is veryslow.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This experiment has been tried for curiosity's sake, and has succeeded;the roots become dry, lose their fibres, and then develop buds, from whichbranches issue; while the buds of the summit become changed into roots.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Seminarii:" "nurseries," as they are more commonly called.</p></body>
