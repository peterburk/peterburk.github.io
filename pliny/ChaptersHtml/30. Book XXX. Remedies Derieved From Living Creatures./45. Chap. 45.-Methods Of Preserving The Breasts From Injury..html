The people of Phrygia andLycaonia have made the discovery, that the grease of the otis<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>is good for affections of the breasts, resulting from recent de-livery: for females affected with suffocations of the uterus,they employ a liniment made of beetles. The shells of par-tridges' eggs, burnt to ashes and mixed with cadmia<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> andwax, preserve the firmness<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> of the breasts. It is generallythought, that if the egg of a partridge or * * * * is passedthree times round a woman's breasts, they will never becomeflaccid; and that, if these eggs are swallowed, they will beproductive of fruitfulness, and promote the plentiful secretion<pb n="5465" />of the milk. It is believed, too, that by anointing a woman'sbreasts with goose-grease, pains therein may be allayed; thatmoles formed in the uterus may be dispersed thereby; andthat itch<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> of the uterus may be dispelled by the application ofa liniment made of crushed bugs.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. x. cc. 29, 50.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxxiv. cc. 22, 23.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxviii. c. 77.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Scabiem vulvarum."</p></body>
