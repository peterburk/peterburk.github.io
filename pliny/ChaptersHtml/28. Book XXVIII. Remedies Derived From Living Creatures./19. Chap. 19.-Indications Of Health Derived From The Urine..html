<div2 type="chapter" n="19" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 19.â€”INDICATIONS OF HEALTH DERIVED FROM THE URINE.</head><p>Certain indications of the health are furnished by the urine.Thus, for example, if it is white at first in the morning andafterwards high-coloured, the first signifies that the digestion isgoing on, the last that it is completed. When the urine is red,it is a bad sign; but when it is swarthy, it is the worst signof all. So, too, when it is thick or full of bubbles, it is a badsign; and when a white sediment forms, it is a symptom ofpains in the region of the viscera or in the joints. A green-coloured urine is indicative of disease of the viscera, a pale urineof biliousness, and a red urine of some distemper in the blood.The urine is in a bad state, too, when certain objects form init, like bran or fine clouds in appearance. A thin, white, urinealso is in a diseased state; but when it is thick and possessedof an offensive smell, it is significant of approaching death: so,too, when with children it is thin and watery.</p><p>The adepts in magic expressly forbid a person, when aboutto make water, to uncover the body in the face of the sun<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> ormoon, or to sprinkle with his urine the shadow of any objectwhatsoever. Hesiod<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> gives a precept, recommending persons tomake water against an object standing full before them, that nodivinity may be offended by their nakedness being uncovered.Osthanes maintains that every one who drops some urineupon his foot in the morning will be proof against all noxiousmedicaments.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This was also one of the Pythagorean precepts.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Works and Days, 1. 727, <hi rend="ital">et seq.</hi></p></body>
