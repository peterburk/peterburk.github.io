<div2 type="chapter" n="24" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 24. (22.)—NINE VARIETIES OF THE NUT.</head><p>The walnut,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> which would almost claim precedence of thesorb in size, yields the palm to it in reference to the esteem<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>in which they are respectively held; and this, although it isso favourite an accompaniment of the Fescennine<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> songs atnuptials. This nut, taken as a whole, is very considerablysmaller than the pine nut, but the kernel is larger in proportion. Nature, too, has conferred upon it a peculiar honour, inprotecting it with a two-fold covering, the first of which formsa hollowed cushion for it to rest upon, and the second is awoody shell. It is for this reason that this fruit has beenlooked upon as a symbol consecrated to marriage,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> its offspring being thus protected in such manifold ways: an explanation which bears a much greater air of probability than thatwhich would derive it from the rattling which it makes whenit bounds from the floor.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> The Greek names that have beengiven to this fruit fully prove that it, like many others, hasbeen originally introduced from Persis; the best kinds beingknown in that language by the names of "Persicum,"<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> and"basilicon;,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> these, in fact, being the names by which they<pb n="3316" />were first known to us. It is generally agreed, too, that onepeculiar variety has derived its name of "caryon,"<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> from theheadache which it is apt to produce by the pungency<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> ofits smell.</p><p>The green shell of the walnut is used for dyeing<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> wool, andthe nuts, while still small and just developing themselves, areemployed for giving a red hue to the hair:<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> a discovery owingto the stains which they leave upon the hands. When old,the nut becomes more oleaginous. The only difference in theseveral varieties consists in the relative hardness or brittlenessof the shell, it being thin or thick, full of compartments orsmooth and uniform. This is the only fruit that Nature hasenclosed in a covering formed of pieces soldered together; theshell, in fact, forming a couple of boats, while the kernel isdivided into four separate compartments<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> by the interventionof a ligneous membrane.</p><p>In all the other kinds, the fruit and the shell respectivelyare of one solid piece, as we find the case with the hazel—nut,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>and another variety of the nut formerly known as "Abellina,"<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> from the name<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> of the district in which it was firstproduced: it was first introduced into Asia and Greece fromPontus, whence the name that is sometimes given to it—the"Pontic nut." This nut, too, is protected by a soft beard,<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span>but both the shell and the kernel are round, and formed of asingle piece: these nuts are sometimes roasted.<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> In themiddle of the kernel we find a germen or navel.</p><p>A third class of nuts is the almond,<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> which has an outer<pb n="3317" />covering, similar to that of the walnut, but thinner, with asecond coat in the shape of a shell. The kernel, however, isunlike that of the walnut, in respect of its broad, flat shape,its firmness, and the superior tastiness of its flavour. It is amatter of doubt whether this tree was in existence in Italy inthe time of Cato; we find him speaking of Greek nuts,<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> butthere are some persons who think that these belong to thewalnut class. He makes mention, also, of the hazel-nut, thecalva,<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> and the Prænestine<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> nut, which last he praises beyondall others, and says<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> that, put in pots, they may be kept freshand green by burying them in the earth.</p><p>At the present day, the almonds of Thasos and those ofAlba are held in the highest esteem, as also two kinds thatare grown at Tarentum, one with a thin,<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span> brittle shell, and theother with a harder<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span> one: these last are remarkably large,and of an oblong shape. There is the almond known asthe "mollusk,"<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span> also, which breaks the shell of itself. Thereare some who would concede a highly honourable interpretation to the name given to the walnut, and say that "juggles"means the "glens," or" acorn of Jove." It is only very latelythat I heard a man of consular rank declare, that he thenhad in his possession walnut-trees that bore two<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span> crops inthe year.</p><p>Of the pistachio, which belongs also to the nut class, wehave already spoken<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span> in its appropriate place: Vitellius introduced this tree into Italy at the same time as the others that<pb n="3318" />we mentioned;<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span> and Flaccus Pompeius, a Roman of Equestrian rank, who served with him, introduced it at the sameperiod into Spain.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Juglans regia of Linnæus.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Tastes have probably altered since this was written.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">These were rude and sometimes obscene songs sung at festivals, andmore particularly marriages.
