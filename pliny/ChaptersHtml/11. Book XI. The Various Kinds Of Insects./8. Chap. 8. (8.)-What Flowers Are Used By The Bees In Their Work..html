(8.)—WHAT FLOWERS ARE USED BY THE BEES IN THEIRWORK.</head><p>Bees form wax<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> from the blossoms of all trees and plants,with the sole exception of the rumex<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and the echinopodes,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>both being kinds of herbs. It is by mistake, however, thatspartum is excepted;<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> for many varieties of honey that comefrom Spain, and have been made in the plantations of it, havea strong taste of that plant. I am of opinion, also, that it iswithout any sufficient reason that the olive has been excepted,seeing that it is a well-known fact, that where olives are inthe greatest abundance, the swarms of bees are the most no-serous. Bees are not injurious to fruit of any kind; they will<pb n="3008" />never settle on a dead flower, much less a dead carcase. Theypursue their labours within three-score paces of their hives;and when the flowers in their vicinity are exhausted, theysend out scouts from time to time, to discover places for forageat a greater distance. When overtaken by night in their expeditions, they watch till the morning, lying on their backs,in order to protect their wings from the action of the dew.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is formed from the honey that the bee has digested.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Sorrel, or monk's rhubarb.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A kind of broom.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Spanish broom, the Stipa tenacissima of Linnæus.
