<div2 type="chapter" n="29" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 29. (15.)ÑTHE TREES OF MOUNT ATLAS. THE CITRUS, ANDTHE TABLES MADE OF THE WOOD THEREOF.</head><p>Mount Atlas is said to possess a forest of trees of a peculiarcharacter,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> of which we have already spoken.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> In the vicinityof this mountain is Mauretania, a country which abounds inthe citrus,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> a tree which gave rise to the mania<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> for finetables, an extravagance with which the women reproach themen, when they complain of their vast outlay upon pearls.There is preserved to the present day a table which belongedto M. Cicero,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> and for which, notwithstanding his comparatively moderate means, and what is even more surprising still,at that day too, he gave no less than one"<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> million sesterces:we find mention made also of one belonging to Gallus Asinius,which cost one million one hundred thousand sesterces. Twotables were also sold by auction which had belonged to KingJuba; the price fetched by one was one million two hundredthousand sesterces, and that of the other something less.There has been lately destroyed by fire, a table which camedown from the family of the Cethegi, and which had been soldfor the sum of one million four hundred thousand sesterces,the price of a considerable domain, if any one, indeed, could befound who would give so large a sum for an estate.<pb n="3195" /></p><p>The largest table that has ever yet been known was onethat belonged to Ptolem¾us, king of Mauretania; it was madeof two semicircumferences joined together down the middle,being four Feet and a half in diameter, and a quarter of a footin thickness: the most wonderful fact, however, connectedwith it, was the surprising skill with which the joining hadbeen concealed,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> and which rendered it more valuable than ifit had been by nature a single piece of wood. The largesttable that is made of a single piece of wood, is the one thattakes its name<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> from Nomius, a freedman of Tiberius C¾sar.The diameter of it is four Feet, short by three quarters of aninch, and it is half a foot in thickness, less the same fraction.While speaking upon this subject, I ought not to omit to mention that the Emperor Tiberius had a table that exceeded fourFeet in diameter by two inches and a quarter, and was an inchand a half in thickness: this, however, was only covered witha veneer of citrus-wood, while that which belonged to hisfreedman Nomius was so costly, the whole material of whichit was composed being knotted<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> wood.</p><p>These knots are properly a disease or excrescence of theroot, and those used for this purpose are more particularlyesteemed which have lain entirely concealed under ground;they are much more rare than those that grow above ground,and that are to be found on the branches also. Thus, to speakcorrectly, that which we buy at so vast a price is in reality adefect in the tree: of the size and root of it a notion may beeasily formed from the circular sections of its trunk. Thetree resembles the wild female cypress<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> in its foliage, smell,and the appearance of the trunk. A spot called Mount Ancorarius, in Nearer Mauretania, used formerly to furnish themost esteemed citrus-wood, but at the present day the supplyis quite exhausted.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Desfontaines observed in the vicinity of Atlas, several trees peculiar to that district.
