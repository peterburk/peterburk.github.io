Hence it is that the bees exercise over them arigorous authority, compel them to take the foremost rank intheir labours, and if they show any sluggishness, punish them<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>without mercy. And not only in their labours do the dronesgive them their assistance, but in the propagation of their species as well, the very multitude of them contributing greatlyto the warmth of the hive. At all events, it is a well-knownfact, that the greater<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> the multitude of the drones, the more<pb n="3011" />numerous is sure to be the progeny of the swarm. When thehoney is beginning to come to maturity, the bees drive awaythe drones, and setting upon each in great numbers, put themall to death. It is only in the spring that the drones areever to be seen. If you deprive a drone of its wings, and thenreplace it in the hive, it will pull off the wings of the otherdrones.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is the fact, but not so their <hi rend="ital">imperfect</hi> state.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">They do not work, but merely impregnate the queen; after whichthey are driven from the hive, and perish of cold and starvation.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It appears, as Cuvier says, that the ancients had <hi rend="ital">some</hi> notion that theswarm was multiplied by the aid of the drones.</p></body>
