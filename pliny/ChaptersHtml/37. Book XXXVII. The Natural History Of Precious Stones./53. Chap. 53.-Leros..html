It is a crystal, with streaks ofwhite and black running across it.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The reading is doubtful, "zeros" and "erros" being given by someMSS. Ajasson hazards a conjecture that it may have been a variety ofquartz, formed of a concretion of agates united by a cement of a similarnature.</p></body>
