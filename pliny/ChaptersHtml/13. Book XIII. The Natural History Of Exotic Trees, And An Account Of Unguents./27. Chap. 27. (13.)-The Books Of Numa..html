<div2 type="chapter" n="27" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 27. (13.)—THE BOOKS OF NUMA.</head><p>There are some facts of considerable importance which makeagainst the opinion expressed by M. Varro, relative to theinvention of paper. Cassius Hemina, a writer of very greatantiquity, has stated in the Fourth Book of his Annals, thatCneius Terentius, the scribe, while engaged in digging on his<pb n="3192" />land in the Janiculum, came to a coffer, in which Numa hadbeen buried, the former king of Rome, and that in this cofferwere also found some books<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> of his. This took place in theconsulship of Publius Cornelius Cethegus, the son of Lucius,and of M. Bæbius Tamphilus, the son of Quintus, the intervalbetween whose consulship and the reign of Numa was fivehundred and thirty-five years. These books were made ofpaper, and, a thing that is more remarkable still, is the factthat they lasted so many years buried in the ground. Inorder, therefore, to establish a fact of such singular importance, I shall here quote the words of Hemina himself—"Somepersons expressed wonder how these books could have possiblylasted so long a time—this was the explanation that Terentius gave: 'In nearly the middle of the coffer there lay a squarestone, bound on every side with cords enveloped in wax;<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>upon this stone the books had been placed, and it was throughthis precaution, he thought, that they had not rotted. Thebooks, too, were carefully covered with citrus leaves,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and itwas through this, in his belief, that they had been protectedfrom the attacks of worms.' In these books were writtencertain doctrines relative to the Pythagorean philosophy; theywere burnt by Q. Petilius, the prætor, because they treatedof philosophical subjects."<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span></p><p>Piso, who had formerly been censor, relates the same factsin the First Book of his Commentaries, but he states in addition,That there were seven books on Pontitical Rights, and seven onthe Pythagorean philosophy.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> Tuditanus, in his FourteenthBook, says that they contained the decrees of uma: Varro, inthe Seventh Book of his "Antiquities of Mankind,"<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> states thatthey were twelve in number; and Antias, in his Second Book,says that there were twelve written in Latin, on pontifical<pb n="3193" />matters, and as many in Greek, containing philosophical precepts. The same author states also in his Third Book whyit was thought proper to burn them.</p><p>It is a fact acknowledged by all writers, that the Sibyl<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>brought three books to Tarquinius Superbus, of which twowere burnt by herself, while the third perished by fire withthe Capitol<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> in the days of Sylla. In addition to these facts,Mucianus, who was three times consul, has stated that he hadrecently read, while governor of Lycia, a letter written uponpaper, and preserved in a certain temple there, which hadbeen written from Troy, by Sarpedon; a thing that surprisesme the more, if it really was the fact that even in the timeof Homer the country that we call Egypt was not in existence.<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>And why too, if paper was then in use, was it thecustom, as it is very well known it was, to write upon leadentablets and linen cloths? Why, too, has Homer<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> stated thatin Lycia tablets<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> were given to Bellerophon to carry, and nota paper letter?</p><p>Papyrus, for making paper, is apt to fail occasionally; sucha thing happened in the time of the Emperor Tiberius, whenthere was so great a scarcity<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> of paper that members of thesenate were appointed to regulate the distribution of it: hadnot this been done, all the ordinary relations of life wouldhave been completely disarranged.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This story, no doubt, deserves to be rejected as totally fabulous, eventhough we have Hemina's word for it.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xvi. c. 70.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">B. xii. c. 7, and B. xiii. c. 31.
