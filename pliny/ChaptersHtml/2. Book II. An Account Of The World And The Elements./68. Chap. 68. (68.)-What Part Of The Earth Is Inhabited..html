<div2 type="chapter" n="68" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 68. (68.)—WHAT PART OF THE EARTH IS INHABITED.</head><p>In the first place, then, it appears, that this should be estimated at half the globe<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>, as if no portion of this half wasencroached upon by the ocean. But surrounding as it doesthe whole of the land, pouring out and receiving all the otherwaters, furnishing whatever goes to the clouds, and feeding thestars themselves, so numerous and of such great size as theyare, what a great space must we not suppose it to occupy!This vast mass must fill up and occupy an infinite extent.To this we must add that portion of the remainder which theheavens<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> take from us. For the globe is divided into fiveparts<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>, termed zones, and all that portion is subject to severecold and perpetual frost which is under the two extremities,about each of the poles, the nearer of which is called thenorth, and the opposite the south, pole. In all these regionsthere is perpetual darkness, and, in consequence of the aspectof the milder stars being turned from them, the light is malignant,and only like the whiteness which is produced byhoar frost. The middle of the earth, over which is the orbitof the sun, is parched and burned by the flame, and is consumed bybeing so near the heat. There are only two of thezones which are temperate, those which lie between the torridand the frigid zones, and these are separated from each other,in consequence of the scorching heat of the heavenly bodies.<pb n="1101" />It appears, therefore, that the heavens take from us threeparts of the earth; how much the ocean steals is uncertain.</p><p>And with respect to the part which is left us, I do notknow whether that is not even in greater danger. This sameocean, insinuating itself, as I have described it, into a number ofbays, approaches with its roaring<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> so near to the inland seas, thatthe Arabian Gulf is no more than 115 milesfrom the Egyptian Sea<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>, and the Caspian only 375 miles fromthe Euxine. It also insinuates itself into the numerous seasby which it separates Africa, Europe, and Asia; hence howmuch space must it occupy? We must also take into account the extent of all the rivers and the marshes, and wemust add the lakes and the pools. There are also the mountains, raised up to the heavens, with their precipitous fronts;we must also subtract the forests and the craggy valleys, thewildernesses, and the places, which, from various causes, aredesert. The vast quantity which remains of the earth<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>, orrather, as many persons have considered it, this speck of aworld<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> (for the earth is no more in regard to the universe),this is the object, the seat of our glory—here we bear ourhonours, here we exercise our power, here we covet wealth,here we mortals create our disturbances, here we continuallycarry on our wars, aye, civil wars, even, and unpeople theearth by mutual slaughter. And not to dwell on public feuds,entered into by nations against each other, here it is that wedrive away our neighbours, and enclose the land thus seizedupon within our own fence<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>; and yet the man who has mostextended his boundary, and has expelled the inhabitants forever so great a distance, after all, what mighty portion of theearth is he master of? And even when his avarice has beenthe most completely satisfied, what part of it can he takewith him into the grave?<pb n="1102" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Jam primum in dimidio computari videtur."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Cœlum;" the rigour of the climate.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The division of the globe into five zones is referred to by Virgil, Geor.i. 233–239, and by Ovid, Met. i. 45, 46.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"...interna maria allatrat,..."</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is considerably more than the distance in the present day.The Isthmus of Suez appears, according to the statement of the mostaccurate geographers, to be about 70 miles in breadth.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hæ tot portiones terræ, as Alexandre correctly remarks, "ironicedictum.
