There was his rejection from the post of master of the horse, by his uncle,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> andthe preference which was given to Lepidus, and that, too, inopposition to his own requests; the hatred produced by theproscription; his alliance in the Triumvirate<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> with some amongthe very worst of the citizens, and that, too, with an unequal<pb n="2196" />share of influence, he himself being entirely borne down bythe power of Antony; his illness<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> at the battle of Philippi;his flight, and his having to remain three days concealed in amarsh,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> though suffering from sickness, and, according to theaccount of Agrippa and Mecænas, labouring under a dropsy;his shipwreck<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> on the coast of Sicily, where he was againunder the necessity of concealing himself in a cave; his desperation, which caused him even to beg Proculeius<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> to puthim to death, when he was hard-pressed by the enemy in anaval engagement;<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> his alarm about the rising at Perusia;<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>his anxiety at the battle of Actium;<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> the extreme danger hewas in from the falling of a tower during the Pannonian war<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>seditions so numerous among his soldiers; so many attacks bydangerous diseases;<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> the suspicions which he entertained<pb n="2197" />respecting the intentions of Marcellus;<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> the disgraceful banishment, as it were, of Agrippa;<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> the many plots against hislife;<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> the deaths of his own children,<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> of which he wasaccused, and his heavy sorrows, caused not merely by theirloss;<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> the adultery<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> of his daughter, and the discovery of herparricidal designs; the insulting retreat of his son-in-law,Nero;<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> another adultery, that of his grand-daughter;<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> to<pb n="2198" />which there were added numerous other evils, such as thewant of money to pay his soldiers; the revolt of Illyria;<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span>the necessity of levying the slaves; the sad deficiency ofyoung men;<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> the pestilence that raged in the City;<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span> thefamine in Italy; the design which he had formed of puttingan end to his life, and the fast of four days, which broughthim within a hair's breadth of death. And then, added toall this, the slaughter of Varus;<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span> the base slanders<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span> whispered against his authority; the rejection of PosthumousAgrippa, after his adoption,<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span> and the regret to which Augustus was a prey after his banishment;<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span> the suspicions toorespecting Fabius, to the effect that he had betrayed his secrets; and then, last of all, the machinations of his wife andof Tiberius, the thoughts of which occupied his last moments.In fine, this same god,<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span> who was raised to heaven, I am at a<pb n="2199" />loss to say whether deservedly or not, died, leaving the son ofhis own enemy his heir.<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In the class of those who were considered peculiarly fortunate; "hâccensurâ," literally, "in this assessment," in allusion to the classification ofthe citizens of Rome, according to the estimate of their property.—B.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B.C. <date value="-45" authname="-45">45</date>, when, being but about eighteen years of age, he had thepresumption to ask his uncle for the office of "magister equitum;" uponwhich Julius Cæsar bestowed it on M. Lepidus, probably being of opinionthat his nephew was not yet fit for the office.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In his triumvirate with Antony and Lepidus, he showed himself noless cruel than his colleague, Antony, notwithstanding the gloss whichPliny attempts to throw over his actions. Two thousand equites andthree hundred senators are said to have been put to death during thisproscription.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Augustus was detained at Dyrrhachium for some time before the battleof Philippi by illness, and had not recovered when the battle took place.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In the first engagement at Philippi, Brutus defeated the army of Augustus, while Cassius was defeated by Antony. Appian speaks also of hisconcealment in a marsh to the south of Philippi.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In his war against Sextus Pompeius, his fleet was twice shattered byshipwreck off the coast of Sicily, and he suffered several defeats by sea.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">C. Proculeius, a member of the equestrian order, and a familiar friendof Augustus. It is of him that Horace speaks in the lines (II. Ode 2),"Vivet extento Proculeius ævo<lb />Notus in fratres animi paterni."<lb />He was one of the Romans to whom Augustus thought of giving hisdaughter Julia in marriage. The mode of his death is mentioned in B.xxxvi. c. 59.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This circumstance is stated more fully by Suetonius in his Life ofAugustus; he tells, that "in crossing from Sicily to Italy to rejoin his forces,Augustus was unexpectedly attacked by Demochares and Apollophanes,two of Pompey's captains, and only escaped in a small vessel with thegreatest difficulty."</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">L. Antonius having raised an army at Præneste, took possession ofthe town of Perusia, which was blockaded by Augustus, and Antonius wasat last obliged to surrender. During this siege Augustus encounteredseveral dangers, and was once nearly killed while sacrificing beneath thewalls, by a band of gladiators, who came upon him unawares.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The victory was long doubtful, and it was only the sudden panic ofCleopatra, that finally ensured it to Augustus.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The exact nature of the accident here alluded to, is discussed by Hardouin, Lemaire, vol. iii. p. 169; he concludes, from the account of Suetonius and of Dion Cassius, that it was owing to the fall of a gallery, whichextended between two towers.—B.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">These are fully described by Suetonius, in his Life of Augustus, c. 80and 81.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">M. Claudius Marcellus, the son of Octavia, sister of Augustus. Hewas adopted by Augustus. Tacitus seems to hint that he was greatly beloved by the Roman people, and it is not improbable that Augustus mayhave become suspicious or jealous of him; his decease took place in histwentieth year.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">To Mitylene. This refers to the jealousy between Marcellus and hisbrother-in-law, M. Vipsanius Agrippa. Pliny probably uses the term"pudenda," implying that Augustus showed neither firmness nor gratitudeon this occasion; for anxious, at any cost, to prevent these differences, hesent Agrippa, against his will, as proconsul to Syria; immediately on whichAgrippa left Rome, but stopped at Mitylene, and left the government ofSyria to his legatus. Upon the death of Marcellus, Agrippa returned toRome.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Dion Cassius mentions three conspiracies, the first by Fabius Cæpioand Muræna, a second, of which he does not name the authors, and athird by Cornelius Cinna.</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Said in allusion to the suspicious deaths of his grandchildren Luciusand Caius, the children of his daughter Julia by Agrippa. They wereprobably removed by the criminal acts of Livia; but some historians havehinted that Augustus was privy to their destruction, the object of whichwas to remove all obstacles that lay in the way of Tiberius to the throne.</p><p><span id="note_17"><a href="#ref_17">17. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Implying that he was conscience-stricken at his share in their death,as well as struck with sorrow and remorse.</p><p><span id="note_18"><a href="#ref_18">18. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">She was his only child; Scribonia was her mother. She was firstmarried to her cousin Marcellus; on his death to L. Vipsanius Agrippa,and after his decease to Tiberius Nero, the son of Livia. Her profligacywas universally known, and Augustus did not scruple to enlarge upon itbefore the senate; but Pliny is the only writer who states that she contemplated an attempt on the life of his father; though Suetonius saysthat she became, at a late period of her reign, an object of interest to thosewho were disaffected. Julia was first banished to Pandataria, off the coastof Campania, and then to Rhegium, which she was never allowed to leave.Her death took place A.D. <date value="14" authname="14">14</date>.</p><p><span id="note_19"><a href="#ref_19">19. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Tiberius Nero, afterwards emperor. Pliny here alludes to his retirement to Rhodes, where he remained seven years. Tacitus representsthat his chief reason for leaving Rome was to escape the society of hiswife Julia, who treated him with the utmost contempt, and whose licentious life was not unknown to him. During this retreat he devoted himself to the study of astrology. He left Rome without the consent of Augustus, who was equally unwilling to allow of his return.</p><p><span id="note_20"><a href="#ref_20">20. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Julia, one of the daughters of Julia and Agrippa, and the wife of L.Æmilius Paulus. She fully inherited the vices of her mother. For anadulterous intercourse with D. Silanus she was banished, by Augustus toTremerus, off the coast of Apulia, where she survived twenty years, dependent on the bounty of the empress Livia. A child born after her dis-grace, was, by order of Augustus, exposed as spurious. She is supposedby some to be the Corinna of Ovid's amatory poems.</p><p><span id="note_21"><a href="#ref_21">21. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He probably alludes to the rising of some tribes in the provinceson the north-eastern coast of the Adriatic, in B.C. <date value="-35" authname="-35">35</date>, who refused topay their tribute. They were finally vanquished by Statilius Taurus,B.C. <date value="-33" authname="-33">33</date>.</p><p><span id="note_22"><a href="#ref_22">22. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">After the defeat of his general Varus, by Arminius, in Germany.</p><p><span id="note_23"><a href="#ref_23">23. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This pestilence is also mentioned by Dion Cassius; it took placeA.U.C. 732.—B.</p><p><span id="note_24"><a href="#ref_24">24. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We have an account of the disastrous expedition of Varus in Florus,B. iv. c. 12.—B.</p><p><span id="note_25"><a href="#ref_25">25. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Suetonius speaks of calumnious pamphlets (libelli), that were circulated about, even in the senate-house, to his extreme disparagement.</p><p><span id="note_26"><a href="#ref_26">26. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A posthumous son of M. Vipsanius Agrippa by Julia, the daughterof Augustus, by whom he was adopted together with Tiberius. He wasafterwards banished to Planaria, off the coast of Corsica, on account ofhis savage and intractable character, though guilty of no crime. Augustus is said to have privately visited him there, which, coming to the earsof Livia, increased her enmity against this youth, and he was murdered byher orders or those of Tiberius.</p><p><span id="note_27"><a href="#ref_27">27. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Tacitus, Ann. B. i. c. 3, says that he was banished by the artifices ofNero.—B.</p><p><span id="note_28"><a href="#ref_28">28. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">After his death his solemn apotheosis took place in the Campus Martius. In some of the coins which were struck even during his life-time, hewas called "Divus," or "the god."</p><p><span id="note_29"><a href="#ref_29">29. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">For Tiberius Nero, the father of Tiberius Cæsar, took the side ofM. Antonius in the Civil War.—B.</p></body>
