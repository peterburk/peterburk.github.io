Ajasson expresses his surprise, that so diligent acollector of facts as Pliny, should have been acquainted with only one example of this kind.ÑB.

Maximus, B. viii. c. 15, gives nearly the same account of a person whom he calls Pherenice; from the resemblance of the names, it hasbeen supposed, that they may both refer to the same individual.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He alludes to the three persons, father, son, and grandson, known bythe name of C. Scribonius Curio. The first was pr¾tor B.C. <date value="-121" authname="-121">121</date>, oneof the most distinguished orators of his time. His son, who acquiredsome reputation as an orator, was tribune of the people B.C. <date value="-90" authname="-90">90</date>, pr¾torB.C. <date value="-82" authname="-82">82</date>, and consul in B.C. <date value="-76" authname="-76">76</date>, with Cn. Octavius. He is represented asbeing possessed of great eloquence, and of extreme purity and brilliancy ofdiction, but to have had none of the other requisites of an orator. Like hisson, he enjoyed the friendship of Cicero. The younger Curio was an oratorof great talents, which, from want of industry, he left uncultivated. Ciceroendeavoured to direct his talents into a proper channel, but all in vain,and he remained to the end a man of worthless and profligate character.He was married to Fulvia, who afterwards became the wife of Antony.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hardouin observes, that M.
