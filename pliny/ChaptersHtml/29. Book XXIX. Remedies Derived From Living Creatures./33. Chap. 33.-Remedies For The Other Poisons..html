<div2 type="chapter" n="33" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 33.—REMEDIES FOR THE OTHER POISONS.</head><p>Where persons have been poisoned by noxious preparationsfrom the wild weasel,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> the proper remedy is the broth of anold cock, taken in considerable quantities. This broth, too,is particularly good, taken as a counter-poison for aconite, incombination with a little salt. Poultry dung—but the whitepart only—boiled with hyssop, or with honied wine, is an excellent antidote to the poison of fungi and of mushrooms: it isa cure also for flatulency and suffocations; a thing the more tobe wondered at, seeing that if any other living creature onlytastes this dung, it is immediately attacked with griping painsand flatulency. Goose blood, taken with an equal quantity ofolive oil, is an excellent neutralizer of the venom of the seahare: it is kept also as an antidote for all kinds of noxiousdrugs, made up into lozenges with red earth of Lemnos and juiceof white-thorn, five drachmæ of the lozenges being taken inthree cyathi of water. The same property belongs also to theyoung of the weasel, prepared in manner already<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> mentioned.</p><p>Lambs' rennet is an excellent antidote to all noxious preparations; the blood, also, of ducks from Pontus;<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> for whichreason it is preserved in a dry state, and dissolved in wine whenwanted, some persons being of opinion that the blood of thefemale bird is the most efficacious. In a similar manner, thecrop of a stork acts as an universal counter-poison; and so doessheep's rennet. A broth made from ram's flesh is particularly good as a remedy for cantharides: sheep's milk also, takenwarm; this last being very useful in cases where personshave drunk an infusion of aconite, or have swallowed thebuprestis in drink. The dung of wood-pigeons is particularlygood taken internally as an antidote to quicksilver; and for<pb n="5408" />narcotic poisons the common weasel is kept dried, and takeninternally, in doses of two drachmæ.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or Ferret, probably.
