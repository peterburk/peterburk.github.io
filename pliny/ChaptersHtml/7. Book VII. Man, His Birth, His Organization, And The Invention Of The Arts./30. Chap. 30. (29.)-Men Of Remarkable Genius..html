(29.)—MEN OF REMARKABLE GENIUS.</head><p>Among so many different pursuits, and so great a variety ofworks and objects, who can select the palm of glory for transcendent genius? Unless perchance we should agree in opinionthat no more brilliant genius ever existed than the Greek poetHomer, whether it is that we regard the happy subject of hiswork, or the excellence of its execution. For this reason itwas that Alexander the Great—and it is only by judges ofsuch high estate that a sentence, just and unbiassed by envy,can be pronounced in the case of such lofty claims—when hefound among the spoils of Darius, the king of Persia, a casketfor perfumes,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> enriched with gold, precious stones, and pearls,covered as he was with the dust of battle, deemed it beneath awarrior to make use of unguents, and, when his friends werepointing out to him its various uses, exclaimed, "Nay, but byHercules! let the casket be used for preserving the poems ofHomer;" that so the most precious work of the human mindmight be placed in the keeping of the richest work of art. Itwas the same conqueror, too, who gave directions that the<pb n="2174" />descendants and house of the poet Pindar<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> should be spared, atthe taking of Thebes. He likewise rebuilt the native city<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> ofAristotle, uniting to the extraordinary brilliancy of his exploitsthis speaking testimony of his kindliness of disposition.</p><p>Apollo impeached by name the assassins of the poet Archilochus<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> at Delphi. While the Lacedemonians were besiegingAthens, Father Liber ordered the funeral rites to be performedfor Sophocles, the very prince of the tragic buskin; repeatedly warning their king, Lysander, in his sleep, to allowof the burial of his favourite. Upon this, the king made enquiry who had lately died in Athens; and understanding withoutany difficulty from the Athenians to whom the god referred, heallowed the funeral rites to be performed without molestation.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny informs us, B. xiii. c. 1, that the art of making perfumes originated with the Persians.—B.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The city was taken by him by assault, and all its buildings, with theexception of the house of Pindar, levelled to the ground; most of the inhabitants were slaughtered, and the rest sold as slaves.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Stagirus, or Stagira, a town of Macedonia, in Chalcidice, on the Strymonic Gulf.

Pliny speaks here of his murderers; butit is generally stated by historians that he was murdered by one individual,by some called Calondas, or Corax, a Naxian, by others Archias.</p></body>
