But why make further mention of these prohibitions, with reference to an art which hasnow crossed the very Ocean even, and has penetrated to thevoid<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> recesses of Nature? At the present day, struck withfascination, Britannia still cultivates this art, and that, withceremonials so august, that she might almost seem<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> to havebeen the first to communicate them to the people of Persia.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>To such a degree are nations throughout the whole world,totally different as they are and quite unknown to one another,in accord upon this one point!<pb n="5427" /></p><p>Such being the fact, then, we cannot too highly appreciatethe obligation that is due to the Roman people, for having putan end to those monstrous rites, in accordance with which, tomurder a man was to do an act of the greatest devoutness, andto eat<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> his flesh was to secure the highest blessings of health.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">More particularly in the worship of their divinity lieu or Hesus, thegod of war.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This he did officially, but not effectually, and the Druids survived asa class for many centuries both in Gaul and Britain.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He alludes to the British shores bordering on the Atlantic.

This might possibly mean, "ThatPersia might almost seem to have communicated it direct to Britain." Ajasson enumerates the following superstitions of ancient Britain, as bearingprobable marks of an Oriental origin: the worship of the stars, lakes,forests, and rivers; the ceremonials used in cutting the plants samiolus,selago, and mistletoe, and the virtues attributed to the adder's egg.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ajasson seems inclined to suggest that this may possibly bear referenceto the Christian doctrines of redemption and the Sacrament of the Lord'sSupper.</p></body>
