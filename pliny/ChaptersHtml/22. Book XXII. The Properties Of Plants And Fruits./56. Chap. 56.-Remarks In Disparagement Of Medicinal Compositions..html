Cerates, poultices,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> plasters, eyesalves, antidotes,—none of these have been formed by Nature,that parent and divine framer of the universe; they are merelythe inventions of the laboratory, or rather, to say the truth,of human avarice.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> The works of Nature are brought intoexistence complete and perfect in every respect, her ingredients being but few in number, selected as they are from adue appreciation of cause and effect, and not from mere guesswork; thus, for instance, if a dry substance is wanted to assume a liquefied form, a liquid, of course, must be employed asa vehicle, while liquids, on the other hand, must be united witha dry substance to render them consistent. But as for man,when he pretends, with balance in<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> hand, to unite and combine the various elementary substances, he employs himselfnot merely upon guesswork, but proves himself guilty of downright impudence.</p><p>It is not my intention to touch upon the medicaments afforded by the drugs of India, or Arabia and other foreignclimates: I have no liking for drugs that come from so great adistance;<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> they are not produced for us, no, nor yet for thenatives of those countries, or else they would not be so readyto sell them to us. Let people buy them if they please, asingredients in perfumes, unguents, and other appliances ofluxury; let them buy them as adjuncts to their superstitionseven, if incense and costus we must have to propitiate thegods; but as to health, we can enjoy that blessing without<pb n="4440" />their assistance, as we can easily prove—the greater reasonthen has luxury to blush at its excesses.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In c. 49 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Malagmata."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Fée, at some length, and with considerable justice, combats thisassertion; though at the same time he remarks that Pliny is right in calling the attention of the medical world to the use of simple substances.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Scripulatim"—"By scruples."</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He forgets that many of them could only be produced by the agencyof an Eastern sun.</p></body>
