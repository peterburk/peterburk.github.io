This plant has anextreme aversion to cold, moisture, and dung; it loves dry,sunny localities, and a soil more particularly that is rich inbrick clay; it requires to be nourished, too, with ashes, which<pb n="4192" />should be mixed with the seed as well, as a preservative againstthe attacks of caterpillars. The ancients held rue in peculiaresteem; for I find that honied wine flavoured with rue wasdistributed to the people, in his consulship,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> by CorneliusCethegus, the colleague of Quintus Flamininus, after theclosing of the Comitia. This plant has a great liking<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> for thefig-tree, and for that tree only; indeed, it never thrives betterthan when grown beneath that tree. It is generally grownfrom slips, the lower end of which is inserted in a perforated<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>bean, which holds it fast, and so nurtures the young plantwith its juices. It also reproduces itself;<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> for the ends of thebranches bending downwards, the moment they reach theground, they take root again. Ocimum<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> is of a very similarnature to rue, except that it dries with greater difficulty.When rue has once gained strength, there is considerable difficulty in stubbing it, as it causes itching ulcerations on thehands, if they are not covered or previously protected by beingrubbed with oil. Its leaves, too, are preserved, being packedin bundles for keeping.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Ruta graveolens of Linn¾us.
