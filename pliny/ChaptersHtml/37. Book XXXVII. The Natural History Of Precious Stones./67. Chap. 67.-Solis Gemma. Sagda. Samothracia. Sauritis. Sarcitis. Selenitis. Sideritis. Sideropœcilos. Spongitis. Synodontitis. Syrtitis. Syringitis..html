SYRTITIS. SYRINGITIS.</head><p>Solis gemma<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> is white, and, like the luminary from whichit takes its name, emits brilliant rays in a circular form. Sagdais found by the people of Chaldæa adhering to ships, and is ofa leek-green colour. The Isle of Samothrace gives its name toa stone<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> which it produces, black and imponderous, and similarto wood in appearance. Sauritis<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> is found, they say, in the bellyof the green lizard, cut asunder with a reed. Sarcitis<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> is a stone,like beef in appearance. Selenitis<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> is white and transparent,with a reflected colour like that of honey. It has a figurewithin it like that of the moon, and reflects the face of thatluminary, if what we are told is true, according to its phases,day by day, whether on the wane or whether on the increase:this stone is a native of Arabia, it is thought. Sideritis<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> is a<pb n="6457" />stone like iron, the presence of which in lawsuits creates discord.Sideropœcilos,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> which is a variety of the same stone, isa native of Æthiopia, and is covered with variegated spots.</p><p>Spongitis has its name from its resemblance to sponge. Synodontitisis a stone found in the brain of the fish known as"synodus."<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> Syrtitis is a stone that used formerly to befound on the shores of the Syrtes,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> though now it is found onthe coasts of Lucania as well: it is of a honey colour, with areflected tint of saffron, and contains stars of a feeble lustrewithin. Syringitis<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> is hollow throughout, like the space betweenthe two joints in a straw.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Gem of the Sun." According to some, this is the Girasol opal; butAjasson has no doubt. from the description given of it by Photius, fromDamascius, that it is identical with the "Asteria" of Chapter 47.
