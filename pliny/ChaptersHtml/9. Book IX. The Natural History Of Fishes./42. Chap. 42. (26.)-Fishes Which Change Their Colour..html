(26.)—FISHES WHICH CHANGE THEIR COLOUR.</head><p>The mæna changes<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> its white colour, and in summer becomes swarthy. The phycis<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> also changes its colour, and<pb n="2415" />while at other times it is white, in spring it is parti-coloured.This last is the only fish that builds itself a nest; it makes itof sea-weed, and there deposits its eggs.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 34; Ælian, Hist. Anim. B. xii. c.48. Rondelet is of opinion that this mæna was the fish still called menolaby the people of Liguria and Rome. It was a fish little valued, and wefind it called by Martial, "inutilis mæna," B. xii. Epigr. 30. Cuviersays, that if it does not change from white to black, as Pliny states, itscolours are much more lively in the spring. It also has an offensive smellat certain times, as is noticed by Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 30, andto which Martial alludes in the above epigram. Ovid also mentions it asa fish of no value; held, in all probability, in the same degree of estimationas a sprat with us. It is, no doubt, the Sparus mæna of Linnæus.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We learn from Aristotle, B. viii. c. 30, that the phycis was a whitishfish, which in the spring assumed a variegated colour. In an Epigram ofApollonides it is called "red;" and Speusippus, as quoted in Athenæus,B. v., says that it is similar to the perch and the channe. Ovid speaks ofit as frequenting the shore, and Oppian represents it as dwelling amongthe sea-weed on the rocks. It also lived on shrimps, and its flesh waslight and wholesome; while its most singular property was that of makingits nest among the fucus or sea-weed, whence its name. All these characteristics, Cuvier says, are to be found, from what Olivi states, in the "<hi rend="ital">go</hi>" ofthe Venetians, found in the Adriatic, the Gobius of Linnæus; the male ofwhich in the spring makes a nest of the roots of the zostera in the mud,in which the female lays her eggs, which are fecundated by itself, andthen protected by it against the attacks of enemies. This is probably thefish that is alluded to by Ovid, Halieut. 1. 121, "The fish that imitates,beneath the waves, the pretty nests of the birds."</p></body>
