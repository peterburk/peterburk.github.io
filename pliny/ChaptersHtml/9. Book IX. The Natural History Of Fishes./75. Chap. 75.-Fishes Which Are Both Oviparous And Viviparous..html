It produces within itself<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> very soft eggs, which it thentransfers to another place in the uterus, and from that partejects them. The same is the case with all those fish to whichwe have given the name of cartilaginous; hence it is, thatthese alone of all the fishes are at once viviparous and oviparous.The male silurus<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> is the only fish among them all that watchesthe eggs after they are brought forth, often for as long a periodas fifty days, that they may not be devoured by other fish.The females of other kinds bring forth their eggs in the courseof three days, if the male has only touched them.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">All the chondropterygian fishes, Cuvier says, have, in addition to theirovaries, real oviducts, which the ordinary fishes have not; the lower partof which, being detached, acts as the uterus, into which the eggs descendwhen they have gained their proper size: and it is here that the youngones burst forth from the egg, when the parent animal is viviparous.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle, Hist.
