The youthfulness of the animal is ascertained bythe whiteness of the teeth<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> These animals take the greatestcare of their teeth; they pay especial attention to the point ofone of them, that it may not be found blunt when wanted forcombat; the other they employ for various purposes, such asdigging up roots and pushing forward heavy weights. Whenthey are surrounded by the hunters, they place those in frontwhich have the smallest teeth, that the enemy may think thatthe spoil is not worth the combat; and afterwards, whenthey are weary of resistance, they break off their teeth, by<pb n="2248" />dashing them against a tree, and in this manner pay theirransom.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">As to the tusks of the elephant, no doubt the opinion of Herodotus,B. iii. c. 97, is correct, that they are teeth, and not horns. They are essentially composed of the same substance with the other teeth, and, like them,are inserted into the jaw, and not into the os frontis, as. is the case withhorns.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Not improbably, the great quantity of fossil ivory which has beenfound, may have given rise to this tale. We have in Lemaire, vol. iii. p.581, a long extract from Cuvier's "<hi rend="ital">Recherches sur les ossements fossiles,</hi>"in which he gives an account of the parts of the world in which the bonesof the elephant have been discovered.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Tables and bedsteads were not only covered or veneered with ivoryamong the Romans, but, in the later times, made of the solid material, aswe learn from ®lian and Athen¾us.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Plutarch, in his treatise on the Shrewdness of Animals, gives thesame statement respecting the whiteness of the teeth in the young animal.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is scarcely necessary to remark, that these statements respecting thesagacity of the elephant in connection with their teeth, are without foundation.ÑB.</p></body>
