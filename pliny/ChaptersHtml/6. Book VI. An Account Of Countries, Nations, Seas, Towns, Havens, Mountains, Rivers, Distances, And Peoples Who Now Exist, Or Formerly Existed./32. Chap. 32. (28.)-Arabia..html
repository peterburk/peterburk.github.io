<div2 type="chapter" n="32" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 32. (28.)—ARABIA.</head><p>Arabia, inferior to no country throughout the whole world,is of immense extent, running downwards, as we have previously stated,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> from Mount Amanus, over against Cilicia andCommagene; many of the Arabian nations having been removed to those countries by Tigranes the Great,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> while othersagain have migrated of their own accord to the shores of oursea<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and the coast of Egypt, as we have already mentioned.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>The Nubei<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> have even penetrated as far as Mount Libanus inthe middle of Syria; in their turn they are bounded by theRamisi, these by the Taranei, and these again by the Patami.</p><p>As for Arabia itself, it is a peninsula, running out betweenthe Red and the Persian Seas; and it is by a kind of design,<pb n="2083" />apparently on the part of nature, that it is surrounded by thesea in such a manner as to resemble very much the form andsize<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> of Italy, there being no difference either in the climate ofthe two countries, as they lie in the same latitudes.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> This,too, renders it equally fertile with the countries of Italy. Wehave already mentioned<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> its peoples, which extend from our seaas far as the deserts of Palmyrene, and we shall now proceed toa description of the remainder. The Scenitæ, as we have alreadystated,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> border upon the Nomades and the tribes that ravagethe territories of Chaldæa, being themselves of wandering habits,and receiving their name from the tents which constitute theirdwellings; these are made of goats' hair, and they pitch themwherever they please. Next after them are the Nabatæi,who have a city called Petra,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> which lies in a deep valley,somewhat less than two miles in width, and surrounded byinaccessible mountains, between which a river flows: it isdistant from the city of Gaza, on our shores, six hundredmiles, and from the Persian Gulf one hundred and thirty-five.At this place two roads meet, the one leading from Syria toPalmyra, and the other from Gaza. On leaving Petra we cometo the Omani,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> who dwell as far as Charax, with their oncefamous cities which were built by Semiramis, Besannisa andSoractia by name; at the present day they are wildernesses.We next come to a city situate on the banks of the Pasitigris,Fora by name, and subject to the king of Charax: to thisplace people resort on their road from Petra, and sail thenceto Charax, twelve miles distant, with the tide. If you areproceeding by water from the Parthian territories, you cometo a village known as Teredon; and below the confluence ofthe Euphrates and Tigris, you have the Chaldæi dwelling<pb n="2084" />on the left side of the river, and the Nomadic tribes of theScenitæ on the right. Some writers also make mentionof two other cities situate at long intervals, as you sail alongthe Tigris, Barbatia, and then Thumata, distant from Petra,they say, ten days' sail; our merchants report that these placesare subject to the king of Charax. The same writers also state,that Apamea<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> is situate where the overflow of the Euphratesunites with the Tigris; and that when the Parthians meditatean incursion, the inhabitants dam up the river by embankments,and so inundate their country.</p><p>We will now proceed to describe the coast after leavingCharax,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> which was first explored by order of king Epiphanes.We first come to the place where the mouth of the Euphratesformerly existed, the river Salsus,<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> and the Promontory ofChaldone,<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> from which spot, the sea along the coast, for anextent of fifty miles,<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> bears more the aspect of a series ofwhirlpools than of ordinary sea; the river Achenus, and then adesert tract for a space of one hundred miles, until we cometo the island of Ichara; the gulf of Capeus, on the shores ofwhich dwell the Gaulopes and the Chateni, and then the gulfof Gerra.<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> Here we find the city of Gerra, five miles incircumference, with towers built of square blocks of salt. Fiftymiles from the coast, lying in the interior, is the region of At-<pb n="2085" />tene, and opposite to Gerra is the island of Tylos,<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> as many milesdistant from the shore; it is famous for the vast number of itspearls, and has a town of the same name; in its vicinity thereis a smaller island,<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> distant from a promontory on the largerone twelve miles and a half. They say that beyond this largeislands may be seen, upon which no one has ever landed:the circumference of the smaller island is one hundred andtwelve miles and a half; and it is more than that distance fromthe Persian coast, being accessible by only one narrow channel. We then come to the island of Asclie, and the nationsof the Nocheti, the Zurazi, the Borgodi, the Catharrei, theNomades, and then the river Cynos.<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> Beyond this, the navigation is impracticable on that side,<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> according to Juba, onaccount of the rocks; and he has omitted all mention of Batrasave,<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> a town of the Omani, and of the city of Omana,<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span>which former writers have made out to be a famous port ofCarmania;<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span> as also of Homna and Attana, towns which atthe present day, our merchants say, are by far the most famousones in the Persian Sea. Passing the river Cynos,<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span> there isa mountain, Juba says, that bears marks of the action of fire;also, the nation of the Epimaranitæ, then a nation of Ichthyophagi, and then a desert island, and the nation of theBathymi. We then come to the Eblitæan Mountains, theisland of Omoënus, the port of Mochorbe, the islands ofEtaxalos and Inchobrice, and the nation of the Cadæi. Thereare many islands also that have no name, but the better knownones are Isura, Rhinnea, and another still nearer the shore,upon which there are some stone pillars with an inscription inunknown characters. There are also the port of Gobœa, thedesert islands called Bragæ, the nation of the Thaludæi, the<pb n="2086" />region of Dabanegoris, Mount Orsa, with a harbour, the gulf ofDuatus, with numerous islands, Mount Tricoryphos,<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span> the regionof Cardaleon, and the islands called Solanades, Cachinna, andthat of the Ichthyophagi. We then find the Clari, the shoreof Mamæum, on which there are gold mines, the region of Canauna, the nations of the Apitami and the Casani, the island ofDevade, the fountain of Coralis, the Carphati, the islands ofCalaëu and Amnamethus, and the nation of the Darræ. Also,the island of Chelonitis,<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span> numerous islands of Ichthyophagi,the deserts of Odanda, Basa, many islands of the Sabæi, therivers Thanar and Amnume, the islands of Dorice, and thefountains of Daulotos and Dora. We find also the islands ofPteros, Labatanis, Coboris, and Sambrachate, with a town ofthe same name<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span> on the mainland. Lying to the south are agreat number of islands, the largest of which is Camari; alsothe river Musecros, and the port of Laupas. We then cometo the Sabæi, a nation of Scenitæ,<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span> with numerous islands, andthe city of Acila,<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span> which is their mart, and from which personsembark for India. We next come to the region of Amithos-cutta. Damnia, the Greater and the Lesser Mizi, and theDrimati. The promontory of the Naumachæi, over againstCarmania, is distant from it fifty miles. A wonderful circumstance is said to have happened here; Numenius, who wasmade governor of Mesena by king Antiochus, while fightingagainst the Persians, defeated them at sea, and at low water,by land, with an army of cavalry, on the same day; inmemory of which event he erected a twofold trophy on thesame spot, in honour of Jupiter and Neptune.<span id="ref_31"><a href="#note_31">[31]</a></span></p><p>Opposite to this place, in the main sea, lies the island of Ogyris,<span id="ref_32"><a href="#note_32">[32]</a></span><pb n="2087" />famous for being the burial-place of king Erythras;<span id="ref_33"><a href="#note_33">[33]</a></span> it is distant from the mainland one hundred and twenty miles, beingone hundred and twelve in circumference. No less famous isanother island, called Dioscoridu,<span id="ref_34"><a href="#note_34">[34]</a></span> and lying in the AzanianSea;<span id="ref_35"><a href="#note_35">[35]</a></span> it is distant two hundred and eighty miles from theextreme point of the Promontory of Syagrus.<span id="ref_36"><a href="#note_36">[36]</a></span></p><p>The remaining places and nations on the mainland, lyingstill to the south, are the Ausaritæ, to whose country it is sevendays' journey among the mountains, the nations of the Larendani and the Catabani, and the Gebanitæ, who occupy a greatnumber of towns, the largest of which are Nagia, and Thomnawith sixty-five temples, a number which fully bespeaks its size.We then come to a promontory, from which to the mainlandof the Troglodytæ it is fifty miles, and then the Thoani, theActæi, the Chatramotitæ, the Tonabei, the Antidalei, the Lexianæ, the Agræi, the Cerbani, and the Sabæi,<span id="ref_37"><a href="#note_37">[37]</a></span> the best knownof all the tribes of Arabia, on account of their frankincense;these nations extend from sea to sea.<span id="ref_38"><a href="#note_38">[38]</a></span> The towns which belong to them on the Red Sea are Marane, Marma, Corolia, andSabatha; and in the interior, Nascus, Cardava, Carnus, andThomala, from which they bring down their spices for exportation. One portion of this nation is the Atramitæ,<span id="ref_39"><a href="#note_39">[39]</a></span> whose<pb n="2088" />capital, Sabota, has sixty temples within its walls. But theroyal city of all these nations is Mariaba;<span id="ref_40"><a href="#note_40">[40]</a></span> it lies upon a bay,ninety-four miles in extent, and filled with islands that produceperfumes. Lying in the interior, and joining up to the Atramitæ, are the Mitæi; are the Minæ; the Elamitæ<span id="ref_41"><a href="#note_41">[41]</a></span> dwell on the sea-shore, in acity from which they take their name. Next to these are theChaculatæ; then the town of Sibi, by the Greeks called Apate;<span id="ref_42"><a href="#note_42">[42]</a></span>the Arsi, the Codani, the Vadei, who dwell in a large town,the Barasasæi, the Lechieni, and the island of Sygaros,<span id="ref_43"><a href="#note_43">[43]</a></span> intothe interior of which no dogs are admitted, and so being exposed on the sea shore, they wander about there and are left todie. We then come to a gulf which runs far into the interior, upon which are situate the Lænitæ, who have givento it their name; also their royal city of Agra,<span id="ref_44"><a href="#note_44">[44]</a></span> and uponthe gulf that of Læana, or as some call it Ælana;<span id="ref_45"><a href="#note_45">[45]</a></span> indeed,by some of our writers this has been called the Ælanitic Gulf,and by others again, the Ælenitic; Artemidorus calls it theAlenitic, and Juba the Lænitic. The circumference of Arabia,measured from Charax to Læana, is said to be four thousandsix hundred and sixty-six miles, but Juba thinks that it issomewhat less than four thousand. Its widest part is at thenorth, between the cities of Heroopolis and Charax. We willnow mention the remaining places and peoples of the interiorof Arabia.</p><p>Up to the Nabatæi<span id="ref_46"><a href="#note_46">[46]</a></span> the ancients joined the Thimanei; atpresent they have next to them the Taveni, and then the Suelleni, the Arraeeni,<span id="ref_47"><a href="#note_47">[47]</a></span> and the Areni,<span id="ref_48"><a href="#note_48">[48]</a></span> whose town is the centre of<pb n="2089" />all the commerce of these parts. Next come the Hemnatæ,the Aualitæ, the towns of Domata and Hegra, the Tamudæi,<span id="ref_49"><a href="#note_49">[49]</a></span>with the town of Badanatha, the Carrei, with the town ofCariati,<span id="ref_50"><a href="#note_50">[50]</a></span> the Achoali, with the town of Foth, and the Minæi,who derive their origin, it is supposed,<span id="ref_51"><a href="#note_51">[51]</a></span> from Minos, king ofCrete, and of whom the Carmæi are a tribe. Next comes atown, fourteen miles distant, called Marippa, and belonging tothe Palamaces, a place by no means to be overlooked, and thenCarnon. The Rhadamæi also—these too are supposed to derivetheir origin<span id="ref_52"><a href="#note_52">[52]</a></span> from Rhadamanthus, the brother of Minos—theHomeritæ,<span id="ref_53"><a href="#note_53">[53]</a></span> with their city of Masala,<span id="ref_54"><a href="#note_54">[54]</a></span> the Hamirei, the Gedranitæ, the Amphyræ, the Ilisanitæ, the Bachilitæ, the Samnæi, the Amitei, with the towns of Nessa<span id="ref_55"><a href="#note_55">[55]</a></span> and Cennesseris,the Zamareni, with the towns of Sagiatta and Canthace, theBacascami, the town of Riphearma, the name by which theycall barley, the Autei, the Ethravi, the Cyrei and the Mathatræi, the Helmodenes, with the town of Ebode, the Agacturi,dwelling in the mountains, with a town twenty miles distant,in which is a fountain called Ænuscabales,<span id="ref_56"><a href="#note_56">[56]</a></span> which signifies"the town of the camels." Ampelome<span id="ref_57"><a href="#note_57">[57]</a></span> also, a Milesiancolony, the town of Athrida, the Calingii, whose city is calledMariva,<span id="ref_58"><a href="#note_58">[58]</a></span> and signifies "the lord of all men;" the towns ofPalon and Murannimal, near a river by which it is thought thatthe Euphrates discharges itself, the nations of the Agrei andthe Ammonii, the town of Athenæ, the Caunaravi, a name<pb n="2090" />which signifies "most rich in herds," the Coranitæ, the Œsani,and the Choani.<span id="ref_59"><a href="#note_59">[59]</a></span> Here were also formerly the Greek townsof Arethusa, Larisa, and Chalcis, which have been destroyedin various wars.</p><p>Ælius Gallus,<span id="ref_60"><a href="#note_60">[60]</a></span> a member of the Equestrian order, is thesole person who has hitherto carried the Roman arms into theselands, for Caius Cæsar, the son<span id="ref_61"><a href="#note_61">[61]</a></span> of Augustus, only had a distant view of Arabia. In his expedition, Gallus destroyed thefollowing towns, the names of which are not given by theauthors who had written before his time, Negrana, Nestum,Nesca, Masugum, Caminacum, Labecia, and Mariva<span id="ref_62"><a href="#note_62">[62]</a></span> above-mentioned, six miles in circumference, as also Caripeta, thefurthest point of his expedition. He brought back with himthe following discoveries—that the Nomades<span id="ref_63"><a href="#note_63">[63]</a></span> live upon milkand the flesh of wild beasts, and that the other nations, likethe Indians, extract a sort of wine from the palm-tree, andoil from sesame.<span id="ref_64"><a href="#note_64">[64]</a></span> He says that the most numerous of thesetribes are the Homeritæ and the Minæi, that their lands arefruitful in palms and shrubs, and that their chief wealth iscentred in their flocks. We also learn from the same sourcethat the Cerbani and the Agræi excel in arms, but moreparticularly the Chatramotitæ;<span id="ref_65"><a href="#note_65">[65]</a></span> that the territories of theCarrei are the most extensive and most fertile; but that theSabæi are the richest of all in the great abundance of theirspice-bearing groves, their mines of gold,<span id="ref_66"><a href="#note_66">[66]</a></span> their streams for<pb n="2091" />irrigation, and their ample produce of honey and wax. Oftheir perfumes we shall have to treat more at large in theBook devoted to that subject.<span id="ref_67"><a href="#note_67">[67]</a></span> The Arabs either wear themitra,<span id="ref_68"><a href="#note_68">[68]</a></span> or else go with their hair unshorn, while the beardis shaved, except upon the upper lip: some tribes, however,leave even the beard unshaved. A singular thing too, one halfof these almost innumerable tribes live by the pursuits of commerce, the other half by rapine: take them all in all, they arethe richest nations in the world, seeing that such vast wealthflows in upon them from both the Roman and the ParthianEmpires; for they sell the produce of the sea or of their forests,while they purchase nothing whatever in return.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. v. c. 21 and 22.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Who called himself the King of kings, and was finally conquered byPompey.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Mediterranean.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. v. c. 12.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Salmasius thinks that this should be written "Nombei;" but Hardouin remarks that the Nombæi were not of Arabian but Jewish extraction, and far distant from Mount Libanus.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The only resemblance between them is, that each is a peninsula; thatof Arabia being of far greater extent than Italy.

D'Anville first identifiedthis place with the modern El Khatiff. Niebuhr finds its site on themodern Koneit of the Arabs, called "Gran" by the Persians; but Fosteris of opinion that he discovered its ruins in the East India Company'sChart, situate where all the ancient authorities had placed it, at the endof the deep and narrow bay at the mouth of which are situated the islandsof Bahrein.
