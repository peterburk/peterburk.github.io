<div2 type="chapter" n="4" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 4.—THE ORIGIN OF GOLD RINGS.</head><p>The worst crime against mankind was committed by himwho was the first to put a ring upon his fingers: and yet weare not informed, by tradition, who it was that first did so. Foras to all the stories told about Prometheus, I look upon them asutterly fabulous, although I am aware that the ancients usedto represent him with a ring of iron: it was their intention,however, to signify a chain thereby, and not an ornament.As to the ring of Midas,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> which, upon the collet being turned<pb n="6072" />inwards, conferred invisibility upon the wearer, who is therethat must not admit, perforce, that this story is even stillmore fabulous? It was the hand, and a sinister<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> hand, too, inevery sense, that first brought gold into such high repute: nota Roman hand, however, for upon that it was the practice towear a ring of iron only, and solely as an indication of warlikeprowess.</p><p>As to the usage followed by the Roman kings, it is not easyto pronounce an opinion: the statue of Romulus in the Capitolwears no ring, nor does any other statue—not that of L. Brutuseven—with the sole exception of those of Numa and ServiusTullius. I am surprised at this absence of the ring, in thecase of the Tarquinii more particularly, seeing that they wereoriginally from Greece,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> a country from which the use ofgold rings was first introduced; though even at the presentday the people of Lacedæmon are in the habit of wearing ringsmade of iron. Tarquinius Priscus, however, it is well known,was the first who presented his son with the golden bulla,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> onthe occasion of his slaying an enemy before he had laid aside theprætexta;<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> from which period the custom of wearing the bullahas been continued, a distinction confined to the children ofthose who have served in the cavalry, those of other personssimply wearing a leather thong.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> Such being the case, I amthe more surprised that the statue of this Tarquinius shouldbe without a ring.</p><p>And yet, with reference to the very name of the ring, I findthat there has been considerable uncertainty. That given to<pb n="6073" />it originally by the Greeks is derived from the finger;<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> whileour ancestors styled it "ungulus;"<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> and in later times bothGreeks and Latins have given it the name of "symbolum."<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>For a great length of time, it is quite clear, not even theRoman senators wore rings of gold: for rings were given, andat the public expense, to those only who were about to proceedon an embassy to foreign nations, the reason being, I suppose,because men of highest rank among foreign nations were perceivedto be thus distinguished. Nor was it the practice forany person to wear these rings, except those who for this reasonhad received them at the public expense; and in most instances,it was without this distinction that the Roman generalscelebrated their public triumphs.<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> For whereas an Etruscancrown<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> of gold was supported from behind over the head ofthe victor, he himself, equally with the slave probably, whowas so supporting the crown, had nothing but a ring ofiron upon his finger.<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> It was in this manner that C. Mariuscelebrated his triumph over Jugurtha; and he never assumed<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>the golden ring, it is said, until the period of histhird consulship.<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> Those, too, who had received golden ringson the occasion of an embassy, only wore them when in public,resuming the ring of iron when in their houses. It is in pursuanceof this custom that even at the present day, an ironring<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> is sent by way of present to a woman when betrothed,and that, too, without any stone in it.</p><p>For my own part, I do not find that any rings were used inthe days of the Trojan War; at all events, Homer nowhere<pb n="6074" />makes mention of them; for although he speaks of the practiceof sending tablets<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> by way of letter,<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> of clothes and gold andsilver plate being kept laid up in chests,<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> still he gives us tounderstand that they were kept secure by the aid of a knottied fast, and not under a seal impressed by a ring. He doesnot inform us too, that when the chiefs drew lots to ascertainwhich one of them should reply to the challenge<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> of theenemy, they made any use of rings<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> for the purpose; and whenhe enumerates the articles that were manufactured at theforge<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> of the gods, he speaks of this as being the origin<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> offibulæ<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span> and other articles of female ornament, such as earringsfor example, but does not make any mention of rings.</p><p><span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span> Whoever it was that first introduced the use of rings, hedid so not without hesitation; for he placed this ornament onthe left hand, the hand which is generally concealed,<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span> whereas,if he had been sure of its being an honourable distinction, itwould have been made more conspicuous upon the right. And ifany one should raise the objection that this would have actedas an impediment to the right hand, I can only say that theusage in more recent times fortifies my opinion, and that theinconvenience of wearing rings on the left hand would havebeen still greater, seeing that it is with the left hand that the<pb n="6075" />shield is held. We find mention made too, in Homer,<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span> of menwearing gold plaited with the hair; and hence it is that I amat a loss to say whether the practice first originated withfemales.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">As Hardouin remarks, "This story is told by others, of Gyges, andnot of Midas." He refers to Cicero, De Off. B. iii. c. 9, in confirmation ofhis assertion.—B. Both Gyges and Midas were noted for their wealth.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Sinistræ." The play here upon the word "sinister" cannot be sowell transferred into the English language; but it bears reference to thedouble meaning of the word, "on the left hand," and "unlucky," "illomened,"or, as we say "sinister." We may remark, that rings werevery generally employed by the Romans, not merely as ornaments, but asindications of office and rank.—B.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From Corinth, it was said: Damaratus of Corinth being the father ofthe first Tarquin. See B. xxxv. c. 5.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">On the subject of "Bullæ," golden balls, worn hy the children of thenobles, see Dr. Smith's Dict.

This word literally signifies a leather strap or thong, andPliny is supposed by Hardouin to mean simply, that, in this latter casethe strap was worn without the bulla, which was in other cases attached toit. Juvenal, Sat. v. l. 164, speaks of the "lorum" of the children of thepoor.—B.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot"><foreign lang="greek">Daktu/lion</foreign>, from <foreign lang="greek">da/ktulos</foreign>, a "finger."</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Festus says that this was the Oscan name for a ring. It wouldappear to be allied to the word "unguis," which means a nail of thefinger or toe, and would perhaps signify a "nail ornament."</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">As meaning a seal or signet, for which purpose, as we shall find explainedin the sequel, the ring was used.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This seems to be the meaning of "Vulgoque sic triumphabant."</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">As to these crowns, see B. xxi. c. 4.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">As to some other particulars connected with this usage, see the endof B. xxviii. c. 7.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">And yet, as Hardouin remarks, before his time, when Scipio wasbesieging Carthage, the bodies of the Roman tribunes, when selected forburial by Hasdrubal, were distinguished by their rings of gold. Theobject of Marius, no doubt, was to ingratiate himself with the upper classes.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A. U.

See Dr. Smith's Diet.Antiq. p. 417.</p><p><span id="note_24"><a href="#ref_24">24. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">As the meaning of this passage has been the subject of much discussionwith commentators, we give it in full, as found in the Edition ofSillig. "Et quisquis primus instituit, cunctanter id fecit, lævis manibuslatentibusque induit, cum, si honos securus fuisset, dextrâ fuerit ostentandus.Quodsi impedimentum potuit in eo aliquod intelligi, etiam serior isusus argumentum est, et majus in lævâ fuisset, quâ seutum capitur."Sillig is of opinion that Pliny is here alluding to the reason given by AteiusCapito (quoted in Maerobius, Saturn. B. vii. c. 13), for wearing the ringon the left hand. It was so worn, he says, from an apprehension thatthe precious stone with which it was set, might receive injury from thecontinual use made of the right hand.</p><p><span id="note_25"><a href="#ref_25">25. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Under the folds of the toga.</p><p><span id="note_26"><a href="#ref_26">26. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Il.
