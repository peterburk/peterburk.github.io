(6.)—THE METHOD OF CONVEYING WATER.</head><p>The most convenient method of making a watercourse fromthe spring is by employing earthen pipes, two fingers in thick-ness, inserted in one another at the points of junction—the onethat has the higher inclination fitting into the lower one—andcoated with quick-lime macerated in oil. The inclination, toensure the free flow of the water, ought to be at least one-fourthof an inch to every hundred feet; and if the water is conveyedthrough a subterraneous passage, there should be air-holes let inat intervals of every two<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> actus. Where the water is wantedto ascend<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> aloft, it should be conveyed in pipes of lead:water, it should be remembered, always rises to the level of itssource. If, again, it is conveyed from a considerable distance,it should be made to rise and fall every now and then, so asnot to lose its motive power. The proper length for eachleaden pipe is ten feet; and if<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> the pipe is five fingers in circumference its weight should be sixty pounds; if eight feet,one hundred; if ten, one hundred and twenty; and so on in thesame proportion.</p><p>A pipe is called "a ten-finger"<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> pipe when the sheet ofmetal is ten fingers in breadth before it is rolled up; a sheetone half that breadth giving a pipe "of five fingers."<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> In allsudden changes of inclination in elevated localities, pipes offive fingers should be employed, in order to break the impetu-osity of the fall: reservoirs,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> too, for branches should be madeas circumstances may demand.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xviii. c. 3, and the Introduction to Vol. III.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In jets, he means.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Si quinarieæ erunt."</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Denaria."</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Quinaria."</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The name given to these reservoirs was "castellum" or "dividien-lum:" in French the name is "<hi rend="ital">regard.</hi>" Vitruvius describes them, B. vii. c. 7.</p></body>
