<div2 type="chapter" n="37" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 37.—THE VARIOUS USES OF FAT AND OBSERVATIONS UPONIT, FIFTY-TWO IN NUMBER.</head><p>Among the remedies common to living creatures, fat is thesubstance held in the next highest esteem, that of swine inparticular, which was employed by the ancients for certainreligious purposes even: at all events, it is still the usage forthe newly-wedded bride, when entering her husband's house,to touch the door-posts with it. There are two methods ofkeeping hogs' lard, either salted or fresh; indeed, the older itis, the better. The Greek writers have now given it the nameof "axungia,"<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> or axle-grease, in their works. Nor, in fact,is it any secret, why swine's fat should be possessed of suchmarked properties, seeing that the animal feeds to such a greatextent upon the roots of plants—owing too, to which, its dungis applied to such a vast number of purposes. It will be aswell, therefore, to premise, that I shall here speak only of thehog that feeds in the open field, and no other; of which kindit is the female that is much the most useful-if she has neverfarrowed, more particularly. But it is the fat of the wild boarthat is held in by far the highest esteem of all.</p><p>The distinguishing properties, then, of swine's-grease, areemollient, calorific, resolvent, and detergent. Some physiciansrecommend it as an ointment for the gout, mixed with goose grease, bull-suet, and wool-grease: in cases, however, wherethe pain is persistent, it should be used in combination withwax, myrtle, resin, and pitch. Hogs' lard is used fresh forthe cure of burns, and of blains, too, caused by snow: withashes of burnt barley and nutgalls, in equal proportions, it is employed for the cure of chilblains. It is good also for excoriationsof the limbs, and for dispelling weariness and lassitude arisingfrom long journeys. For the cure of chronic cough, newlard is boiled down, in the proportion of three ounces to three<pb n="5325" />cyathi of wine, some honey being added to the mixture. Oldlard too, if it has been kept without salt, made up into pillsand taken internally, is a cure for phthisis: but it is a generalrule not to use it salted in any cases except where detergents arerequired, or where there are no symptoms of ulceration. Forthe cure of phthisis, some persons boil down three ounces ofhogs' lard and honied wine, in three cyathi of ordinary wine;and after swathing the sides, chest, and shoulders of the patientwith compresses steeped in the preparation, administer to him,every four days, some tar with an egg: indeed, so potent isthis composition, that if it is only attached to the knees even,the flavour of it will ascend to the mouth, and the patientwill appear to spit it out,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> as it were.</p><p>The grease of a sow that has never farrowed, is the mostuseful of all cosmetics for the skin of females; but in all cases,hogs' lard is good for the cure of itch-scab, mixed with pitchand beef-suet in the proportion of one-third, the whole beingmade lukewarm for the purpose. Fresh hogs' lard, applied asa pessary, imparts nutriment to the infant in the womb, andprevents abortion. Mixed with white lead or litharge, it restores scars to their natural colour; and, in combination withsulphur, it rectifies malformed nails. It prevents the hair alsofrom falling off; and, applied with a quarter of a nutgall, itheals ulcers upon the head in females. When well smoked, itstrengthens the eyelashes. Lard is recommended also for phthisis,boiled down with old wine, in the proportion of one ounce to asemisextarius, till only three ounces are left; some persons adda little honey to the composition. Mixed with lime, it is usedas a liniment for inflamed tumours, boils, and indurations ofthe mamillæ: it is curative also of ruptures, convulsions,cramps, and sprains. Used with white hellebore, it is goodfor corns, chaps, and callosities; and, with pounded earthen-ware<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> which has held salted provisions, for imposthumes ofthe parotid glands and scrofulous sores. Employed as a friction in the bath, it removes itching sensations and pimples: butfor the treatment of gout there is another method of preparingit, by mixing it with old oil, and adding pounded sarcophagus<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> stone and cinquefoil bruised in wine, or else with lime<pb n="5326" />or ashes. A peculiar kind of plaster is also made of it for thecure of inflammatory ulcers, seventy-five denarii of hogs' lardbeing mixed with one hundred of litharge.</p><p>It is reckoned a very good plan also to anoint ulcers withboars' grease, and, if they are of a serpiginous nature, to addresin to the liniment. The ancients used to employ hogs' lardin particular for greasing the axles of their vehicles, that thewheels might revolve the more easily, and to this, in fact, it owesits name of "axungia." When hogs' lard has been used for thispurpose, incorporated as it is with the rust of the iron uponthe wheels, it is remarkably useful as an application for diseases of the rectum and of the generative organs. The ancientphysicians, too, set a high value upon the medicinal propertiesof hogs' lard in an unmixed state: separating it from thekidneys, and carefully removing the veins, they used to washand rub it well in rain water, after which they boiled it severaltimes in a new earthen vessel, and then put it by for keeping.It is generally agreed that it is more emollient, calorific, andresolvent, when salted; and that it is still more useful whenit has been rinsed in wine.</p><p>Massurius informs us, that the ancients set the highest'value of all upon the fat of the wolf: and that it was for thisreason that the newly-wedded bride used to anoint the doorposts of her husband's house with it, in order that no noxiousspells might find admittance.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From the Latin "axis," an "axle," and ungo," "to anoint."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hence it was a notion in the sixteenth century, that pitch and hogs'lard is a cure for syphilis, by promoting salivation.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Farina salsamentariæ testæ."</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxxvi. c. 27.</p></body>
