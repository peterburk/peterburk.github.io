(21).ÑFOR VARIETIES OF THE SORB.</head><p>There are four varieties of the sorb: there being some thathave all the roundness<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> of the apple, while others are conicallike the pear,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and a third sort are of an oval<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> shape, likesome of the apples: these last, however, are apt to be remarkably acid. The round kind is the best for fragrance andsweetness, the others having a vinous flavour; the finest,however, are those which have the stalk surrounded withtender leaves. A fourth kind is known by the name of "torminalis:"<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> it is only employed, however, for remedial pur-<pb n="3315" />poses. The tree is a good bearer, but does not resemble theother kinds, the leaf being nearly that of the plane-tree; thefruit, too, is particularly small. Cato<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> speaks of sorbs beingpreserved in boiled wine.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The ordinary sorb-apple of horticulturists.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The sorb-pear.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Varying but little, probably, from the common sorb, the Sorbus domestica of Linn¾us.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">FŽe is inclined to think that it is the Sorbus terminalis of Lamarck.Anguillara thinks that it is the Crat¾gus of Theophrastus, considered bySprengel to be identical with the Crat¾gus azarolus of Linn¾us.
