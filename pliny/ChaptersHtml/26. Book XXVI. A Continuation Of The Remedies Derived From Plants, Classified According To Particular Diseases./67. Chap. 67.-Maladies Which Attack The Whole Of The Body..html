Thefollowing I find mentioned as general remedies: in preferenceto anything else, an infusion of dodecatheos,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> a plant alreadydescribed, should be taken in drink, and then the roots of theseveral kinds<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> of panaces, in maladies of long standing moreparticularly: seed, too, of panaces should be used for intestinalcomplaints. For all painful affections of the body we findjuice of scordium<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> recommended, as also that of betony: thislast, taken in a potion, is particularly excellent for removinga wan and leaden hue of the skin, and for improving its gene-ral appearance.<pb n="5195" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxv.c.9</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxv.c.11, <hi rend="ital">et seq.</hi></p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">see B. xxv.c.27.</p></body>
