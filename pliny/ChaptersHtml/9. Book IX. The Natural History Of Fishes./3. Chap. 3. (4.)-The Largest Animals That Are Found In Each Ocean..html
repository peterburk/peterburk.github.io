(4.)—THE LARGEST ANIMALS THAT ARE FOUND IN EACH OCEAN.</head><p>The largest animals found in the Indian Sea are the pistrixand the balæna; while of the Gallic Ocean the physeter<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> is<pb n="2362" />the most bulky inhabitant, raising itself aloft like some vastcolumn, and as it towers above the sails of ships, belching forth,as it were, a deluge of water. In the ocean of Gades there isa tree,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> with outspread branches so vast, that it is supposedthat it is for that reason it has never yet entered the Straits.There are fish also found there which are called sea-wheels,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> inconsequence of their singular conformation; they are dividedby four spokes, the nave being guarded on every side by acouple of eyes.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From the Greek <foreign lang="greek">fushth\r,</foreign> "a blower," probably one of the whalespecies, so called from its blowing forth the water. Hardouin remarks, thatPliny mentions the Gallic Ocean, in B. vi. c. 33, as ending at the Pyrenees;and, probably, by this term he means the modern Bay of Biscay. Rondeletius, B. xvi. c. 14, says, that this fish is the same that is called by theNarbonnese peio mular, by the Italians capidolio, and by the people ofSaintonge, "sedenette." Cuvier conjectures also, that this was some kindof large whale; a fish which was not unfrequently found, in former times,in the gulf of Aquitaine, the inhabitants of the shores of which were skilledin its pursuit. Ajasson states that Valmont de Bomare was of opinion that it was the porpoise; but, as he justly remarks, the size of that animaldoes not at all correspond with the magnitude of the "physeter," as herementioned.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier suggests that the idea of such an animal as the one herementioned. probably took its rise in the kind of sea star-fish, now knownas Medusa's head, the Asterias of Linnæus; but that the enormous size hereattributed to it, has no foundation whatever in reality. He remarks also,that the inhabitants of the north of Europe, have similar stories relativeto a huge polypus, which they call the "kraken." We may, however, beallowed to observe, that the "kraken," or "korven," mentioned by goodbishop Pontoppidan, bears a closer resemblance to the so-called "seaserpent," than to anything of the polypus or sepia genus.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Rotæ." Cuvier suggests that this idea of the wheel was takenfrom the class of zoophytes named "Medusæ," by Linnæus, which have theform of a disc, divided by radii, and dots which may have been taken foreyes. But then, as he says, there are none of them of an excessive size,as Pliny would seem to indicate by placing them in this Chapter, and whichÆlian has absolutely attributed to them in B. xiii. c. 20. Of the largestrhizostoma, Cuvier says, that he had even seen, the diameter of the discdid not exceed two feet.</p></body>
