(78.)ÑOF THE DIFFERENCE OF NATIONS AS DEPENDING ON THENATURE OF THE WORLD.</head><p>To these circumstances we must add those that are connected with certain celestial causes. There can be no doubt,that the ®thiopians are scorched by their vicinity to thesun's heat, and they are born, like persons who have beenburned, with the beard and hair frizzled<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>; while, in theopposite and frozen parts of the earth, there are nations withwhite skins and long light hair. The latter are savagefrom the inclemency of the climate, while the former aredull from its variableness<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>. We learn, from the form of the<pb n="1111" />legs, that in the one, the fluids, like vapour, are forced intothe upper parts of the body, while in the other, being agross humour, it is drawn downwards into the lower parts<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>.In the cold regions savage beasts are produced, and in theothers, various forms of animals, and many kinds of birds<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>.In both situations the body grows tall, in the one case bythe force of fire, and in the other by the nutritive moisture.</p><p>In the middle of the earth there is a salutary mixture ofthe two, a tract fruitful in all things, the habits of the bodyholding a mean between the two, with a proper temperingof colours; the manners of the people are gentle, the intellectclear<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>, the genius fertile and capable of comprehending everypart of nature. They have formed empires, which has neverbeen done by the remote nations; yet these latter have neverbeen subjected by the former, being severed from them andremaining solitary, from the effect produced on them bytheir savage nature.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Vibrato;" the same term is applied by Turnus to the hair of ®neas;®n. xii. 100.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Mobilitate hebetes;" it is not easy to see the connexion betweenthese two circumstances.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There is a passage in Galen, De Temperamentis, iii. 6, which mayappear to sanction the opinion of our author; "Siccos esse, quibus macrasunt crura; humidos, quibus crassa."</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The latter part of the remark is correct, but the number of ferociousanimals is also greater in the warmer regions; there is, in fact, a greatervariety in all the productions of nature in the warmer districts of theglobe, except in those particular spots where animal or vegetable life iscounteracted by some local circumstances, as in many parts of Asia andAfrica by the want of water.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Sensus liquidus;" Alexandre explains this expression, "judiciumsanum, mens intelligendo apta."
