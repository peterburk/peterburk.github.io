Norwas it now any individual citizen, but the universal Romanname, that had been rendered infamous by avarice, when KingMithridates caused molten gold to be poured into the mouthof Aquilius<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> the Roman general, whom he had taken prisoner:such were the results of cupidity.</p><p>One cannot but feel ashamed, on looking at those new-fanglednames which are invented every now and then, from theGreek language, by which to designate vessels of silver filagreed<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>or inlaid with gold, and the various other practices bywhich such articles of luxury, when only gilded,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> are made tosell at a higher price than they would have done if made ofsolid gold: and this, too, when we know that Spartacus<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> forbadeany one of his followers to introduce either gold or silver intothe camp—so much more nobleness of mind was there in thosedays, even in our runaway slaves.</p><p>The orator Messala has informed us that Antonius the triumvirmade use of golden vessels when satisfying the most humiliatingwants of nature, a piece of criminality that would havereflected disgrace upon Cleopatra even! Till then, the mostconsummate instances of a similar licentiousness had been foundamong strangers only—that of King Philip, namely, who was inthe habit of sleeping with a golden goblet placed beneath his pillows,and that of Hagnon of Teos, a commander under Alexanderthe Great, who used to fasten the soles of his sandalswith nails of gold.<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> It was reserved for Antonius to be theonly one thus to impart a certain utility to gold, by putting an<pb n="6093" />insult upon Nature. Oh how righteously would he himselfhave been proscribed! but then the proscription should havebeen made by Spartacus.<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Fames auri."
