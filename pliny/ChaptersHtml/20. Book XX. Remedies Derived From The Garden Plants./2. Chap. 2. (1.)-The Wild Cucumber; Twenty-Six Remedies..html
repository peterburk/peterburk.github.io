<div2 type="chapter" n="2" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 2. (1.)—THE WILD CUCUMBER; TWENTY-SIX REMEDIES.</head><p>We have already stated<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> that there is a wild cucumber, considerably smaller than the cultivated one. From this cucumber the medicament known as "elaterium" is prepared, beingthe juice extracted from the seed.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> To obtain this juice thefruit is cut before it is ripe—indeed, if this precaution is nottaken at an early period, the seed is apt to spirt<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> out and beproductive of danger to the eyes. After it is gathered, the fruit iskept whole for a night, and on the following day an incisionis made in it with a reed. The seed, too, is generally sprinkledwith ashes, with the view of retaining in it as large a quantity ofthe juice as possible. When the juice is extracted, itis received in rain water, where it falls to the bottom; afterwhich it is thickened in the sun, and then divided into lozenges,<pb n="4208" />which are of singular utility to mankind for healing dimness<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>of sight, diseases of the eyes, and ulcerations of the eyelids.It is said that if the roots of a vine are touched with thisjuice, the grapes of it will be sure never to be attacked bybirds.</p><p>The root,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> too, of the wild cucumber, boiled in vinegar, isemployed in fomentations for the gout, and the juice of it isused as a remedy for tooth-ache. Dried and mixed with resin,the root is a cure for impetigo<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> and the skin diseases knownas "psora"<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> and "lichen:"<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> it is good, too, for imposthumesof the parotid glands and inflammatory tumours,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> and restoresthe natural colour to the skin when a cicatrix has formed.—The juice of the leaves, mixed with vinegar, is used as aninjection for the ears, in cases of deafness.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. xix. c. 24: so, too, Dioscorides, B. iv. c. 154. The wildcucumber of Pliny, as Fée observes, is in reality not a cucumber,but atotally different plant, the Cucumis silvestris asininus of C. Bauhin, theMomordica elaterium of Linnæus, or squirting cucumber.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Elaterium, Fée says, is not extracted from the seed, but is the juiceof the fruit itself, as Pliny, contradicting himself, elsewhere informs us.Theophrastus commits the same error, which Dioscorides does not; andit is not improbable that Pliny has copied from two sources the methodof making it.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Meaning the juice and seed combined, probably. Fée thinks that itis to this the medicament owes its name, from <foreign lang="greek">e)la/unw,</foreign> to "drive" or"impel." It is much more probable, however, that the medicine was socalled from its strong purgative powers; for, as Galen tells us,<foreign lang="greek">e)lath/rion</foreign>was a name given to purgative medicines in general.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Dioscorides, B. iv. c. 154, states to this effect. Fée remarks that,singularly enough, most of the antiophthalmies used by the ancients, werecomposed of acrid and almost corrosive medicaments, quite in opposition tothe sounder notions entertained on the subject by the moderns.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Dioscorides says the same; and much the same statements are madeby Celsus, Apulcius, Marcellus Empiricus, and Plinius Valerianus Thedifferent parts of the plant, dried, have but very feeble properties,Fée says.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A sort of tetter or ring-worm.

"Panus" was the name given to a wide-spreading, butnot deeply-seated, tumour, the surface of which presented a blisteredappearance.</p></body>
