<div2 type="chapter" n="5" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 5. (4.)—REMARKABLE FACTS CONNECTED WITH THECULTURE OF THE VINE.</head><p>The elder Cato, who was rendered more particularly illustrious by his triumph<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and the censorship, and even more soby his literary fame, and the precepts which he has given tothe Roman people upon every subject of utility, and theproper methods of cultivation in particular; a man who, bythe universal confession, was the first husbandman of his ageand without a rival-has mentioned a few varieties only ofthe vine, the very names of some of which are by this utterlyforgotten.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> His statement on this subject deserves ourseparate consideration, and requires to be quoted at length, inorder that we may make ourselves acquainted with the different varieties of this tree that were held in the highest esteemin the year of the City of Rome 600, about the time of thecapture of Carthage and Corinth, the period of his death: itwill show too, what great advances civilization has made inthe last two hundred and thirty years. The following are theremarks which he has made on the subject of the vine and thegrape.<pb n="3234" /></p><p>"Where the site is considered to be most favourable to thegrowth of the vine, and exposed to the warmth of the sun,you will do well to plant the small<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> Aminean, as well as thetwo eugenia,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and the smaller helvia.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> On the other hand,where the soil is bf a denser nature or more exposed to fogs,the greater Aminean should be planted, or else the Murgentine,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> or the Apician of Lucania. The other varieties of thegrape are, for the most part, adapted to any kind of soil; theyare best preserved in a lora.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> The best for keeping by hanging, are the duracinus kind, the greater Aminean, and theScantian;<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> these, too, will make excellent raisins for keepingif dried at the blacksmith's forge." There are no precepts inthe Latin language on this subject more ancient than these, sonear are we to the very commencement of all our practicalknowledge! The Aminean grape, of which mention has beenmade above, is by Varro called the "Scantian."</p><p>In our own times we have but few instances of any consummate skill that has been manifested in reference to this subject:the less excuse then should we have for omitting any particularwhich may tend to throw a light upon the profits that maybe derived from the culture of the vine, a point which on alloccasions is regarded as one of primary importance. AciliusSthenelus, a man of plebeian rank, and the son of a freedman,acquired very considerable repute from the cultivation of a vineyard in the territory of Nomentum, not more than sixty jugerain extent, and which he finally sold for four hundred thousandsesterces. Vetulenus Ægialus too, a freedman as well, acquired very considerable note in the district of Liternum,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> inCampania, and, indeed, received a more extensive share ofthe public favour, from the fact that he cultivated the spot<pb n="3235" />which had been the place of exile of Scipio Africanus.<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> Thegreatest celebrity of all, however, was that which, by theagency of the same Sthenelus, was accorded to RhemmiusPalæmon, who was also equally famous as a learned grammarian. This person bought, some twenty years ago, an estateat the price of six hundred thousand sesterces in the samedistrict of Nomentum, about ten miles distant from the City ofRome. The low price of property<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> in the suburbs, on everyside of the City, is well known; but in that quarter in particular, it had declined to a most remarkable extent; for theestate which he purchased had become deteriorated by long-continued neglect, in addition to which it was situate in thevery worst part of a by no means favourite locality.<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> Suchwas the nature of the property of which he thus undertook thecultivation, not, indeed, with any commendable views or intentions at first, but merely in that spirit of vanity for which hewas notorious in so remarkable a degree. The vineyards wereall duly dressed afresh, and hoed, under the superintendence ofSthenelus; the result of which was that Palæmon, while thusplaying the husbandman, brought this estate to such an almostincredible pitch of perfection, that at the end of eight yearsthe vintage, as it hung on the trees, was knocked down to apurchaser for the sum of four hundred thousand sesterces;while all the world was running to behold the heaps upon heapsof grapes to be seen in these vineyards. The neighbours, byway of finding some excuse for their own indolence, gave allthe credit of this remarkable success to Palæmon's profounderudition; and at last Annæus Seneca,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> who both held thehighest rank in the learned world, and an amount of power andinfluence which at last proved too much for him—this sameSeneca, who was far from being an admirer of frivolity, wasseized with such vast admiration of this estate, as not to Feelashamed at conceding this victory to a man who was otherwise the object of his hatred, and who would be sure to makethe very most of it, by giving him four times the original cost<pb n="3236" />for those very vineyards, and that within ten years from thetime that he had taken them under his management. Thiswas an example of good husbandry worthy to be put inpractice upon the lands of Cæcuba and of Setia; for since thenthese same lands have many a time produced as much as sevenculei to the jugerum, or in other words, one hundred and fortyamphoræ of must. That no one, however, may entertain thebelief that ancient times were surpassed on this occasion, Iwould remark that the same Cato has stated in his writings, thatthe proper return was seven culei to the jugerum: all of themso many instances only tending most convincingly to provethat the sea, which in our rashness we trespass upon, does notmake a more bounteous return to the merchant, no, not eventhe merchandize that we seek on the shores of the Red andthe Indian Seas, than does a well-tilled homestead to theagriculturist.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B.C. <date value="-194" authname="-194">194</date>, for his successes in Spain.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Mode of culture, locality, climate, and other extraneous circumstances,work, no doubt, an entire change in the nature of the vine.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably the first of the five that he has mentioned in c. 4.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He has only mentioned one sort in c. 4.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See c. 4.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See c. 4.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We have no corresponding word for this beverage in the Englishlanguage-a thin, poor liquor, made by pouring water on the husks andstalks after being fully pressed, allowing them to soak, pressing them again,and then fermenting the liquor.
