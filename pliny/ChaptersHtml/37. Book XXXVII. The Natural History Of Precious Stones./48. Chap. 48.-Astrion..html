Some will have it that this stonereceives its name from the fact that, when held opposite to thestars, it absorbs the light they emit and then returns it. Thefinest stones, they say, are those of Carmania, there beingnone more entirely free from all defects. They add, also, thata stone of inferior quality is known as "ceraunia,"<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and that,in the worst of all, the light is very similar to that given by alamp.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Star-stone."
