<div2 type="chapter" n="16" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 16.—THE REPRODUCTION OF BEES.</head><p>How bees generate their young has been a subject of greatand subtle research among the learned; seeing that no one hasever witnessed<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> any sexual intercourse among these insects.Many persons have expressed an opinion that they must beproduced from flowers, aptly and artistically arranged byNature; while others, again, suppose that they are producedfrom an intercourse with the one which is to be found in everyswarm, and is usually called the king. This one, they say, isthe only male<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> in the hive, and is endowed with such extraordinary proportions, that it may not become exhaustedin the performance of its duties. Hence it is, that no offspring can be produced without it, all the other bees beingfemales,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and attending it in its capacity of a male, and notas their leader. This opinion, however, which is otherwisenot improbable, is sufficiently refuted by the generation of thedrones. For on what grounds could it possibly happen thatthe same intercourse should produce an offspring part of whichis perfect, and part in an imperfect state? The first surmisewhich I have mentioned would appear, indeed, to be muchnearer the truth, were it not the case that here another difficulty meets us—the circumstance that sometimes, at the extremity of the combs, there are produced bees of a larger size,which put the others to flight. This noxious bee bears thename of <hi rend="ital">æstrus,</hi><span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and how is it possible that it should ever beproduced, if it is the fact that the bees themselves form theirprogeny?<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span></p><p>A fact, however, that is well ascertained, is, that bees sit,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>like the domestic fowl, that which is hatched by them at<pb n="3017" />first having the appearance of a white maggot, and lying acrossand adhering so tenaciously to the wax as to seem to be part of it.The king, however, from the earliest moment, is of the colourof honey, just as though he were made of the choicest flowers,nor has he at any time the form of a grub, but from the veryfirst is provided with wings.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> The rest of the bees, as soonas they begin to assume a shape, have the name of <hi rend="ital">nymphæ,</hi><span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>while the drones are called <hi rend="ital">sirenes,</hi> or <hi rend="ital">cephenes.</hi> If a person takes off the head of either kind before the wings areformed, the rest of the body is considered a most choice morselby the parents. In process of time the parent bees instilnutriment into them, and sit upon them, making on this occasion a loud humming noise, for the purpose, it is generallysupposed, of generating that warmth which is so requisite forhatching the young. At length the membrane in which eachof them is enveloped, as though it lay in an egg, bursts asunder,and the whole swarm comes to light.</p><p>This circumstance was witnessed at the suburban retreat ofa man of consular dignity near Rome, whose hives were madeof transparent lantern horn: the young were found to be developed in the space of forty-five days. In some combs, there isfound what is known by the name of " nail" wax;<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> it is bitterand hard, and is only met with when the bees have failed tohatch their young, either from disease or a natural sterility,it is the abortion, in fact, of the bees. The young ones, themoment they are hatched, commence working with theirparents, as though in a course of training, and the newly-bornking is accompanied by a multitude of his own age.</p><p>That the supply may not run short, each swarm rears several kings; but afterwards, when this progeny begins to arriveat a mature age, with one accord<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> they put to death the inferior ones, lest they should create discord in the swarm.<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>There are two sorts of king bees; those of a reddish colour arebetter than the black and mottled ones. The kings have<pb n="3018" />always a peculiar form of their own, and are double the sizeof any of the rest; their wings are shorter<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> than those of theothers, their legs are straight, their walk more upright, andthey have a white spot on the forehead, which bears some resemblance to a diadem: they differ, too, very much from therest of the community, in their bright and shining appearance.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It takes place while they are on the wing.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The only prolific <hi rend="ital">female,</hi> in reality.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Some unprolific females and some males, in reality.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier thinks that either hornets, or else the drones, must be alludedto.
