<div2 type="chapter" n="3" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 3.—REMEDIES DERIVED FROM WATER.</head><p>According to their respective kinds, these waters are beneficial for diseases of the sinews, feet, or hips, for sprains or forfractures; they act, also, as purgatives upon the bowels, healwounds,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and are singularly useful for affections of the headand ears: indeed, the waters of Cicero are good for the eyes.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>The country-seat where these last are found is worthy of somefurther mention: travelling from Lake Avernus towardsPuteoli, it is to be seen on the sea-shore, renowned for its fineportico and its grove. Cicero gave it the name of Academia,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>after the place so called at Athens: it was here that he composed those treatises<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> of his that were called after it; it washere, too, that he raised those monuments<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> to himself; asthough, indeed, he had not already done so throughout thelength and breadth of the known world.</p><p>Shortly after the death of Cicero, and when it had comeinto the possession of Antistius Vetus,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> certain hot springsburst forth at the very portals<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> of this house, which werefound to be remarkably beneficial for diseases of the eyes, andhave been celebrated in verse by Laurea Tullius,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> one of thefreedmen of Cicero; a fact which proves to demonstration thathis servants even had received inspiration from that majesticand all-powerful genius of his. I will give the lines, as theydeserve to be read, not there only, but everywhere:<pb n="5474" />Great prince of Roman eloquence, thy grove,<lb />Where erst thou bad'st it rise, is verdant now;<lb />Thy villa, from fair Academia<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> nam'd,<lb />From Vetus now its finish'd graces takes.<lb />Here, too, fair streams burst forth, unknown before,<lb />Which with their spray the languid eves relieve.<lb />The land, I ween, these bounteous springs reveal'd,<lb />To honour Cicero, its ancient lord.<lb />Throughout the world his works by eyes are scann'd;<lb />May eyes unnunber'd by these streams be heal'd.<lb /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Eaux Bonnes in the Basses Pyrénées are good for wounds.
