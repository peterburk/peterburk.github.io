Thelentil thrives best in a soil that is rather thin than rich, andmostly stands in need of dry weather. There are two kindsof lentil grown in Egypt; one of which is rounder and blackerthan the other, which has a peculiar shape of its own. Thename of this plant has been applied to various uses, andamong others has given origin to our word "lenticula."<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> Ifind it stated in some authors that a lentil diet is productive ofevenness of temper. The pea requires to be sown in a warm,sunny spot, and is ill able to endure cold; hence in Italy andthe more rigorous climates, it is sown in the spring only, a light,loose soil being chosen for the purpose.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pisum sativum of Linn¾us.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Meaning a wart or pimple on the face.</p></body>
