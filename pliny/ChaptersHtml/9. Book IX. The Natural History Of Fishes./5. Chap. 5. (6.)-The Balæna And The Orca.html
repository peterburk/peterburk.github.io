<div2 type="chapter" n="5" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 5. (6.)—THE BALÆNA AND THE ORCA</head><p>The balæna<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> penetrates to our seas even. It is said thatthey are not to be seen in the ocean of Gades before the wintersolstice, and that at periodical seasons they retire and concealthemselves in some calm capacious bay, in which they take adelight in bringing forth. This fact, however, is known tothe orca,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> an animal which is peculiarly hostile to the balæna,and the form of which cannot be in any way adequately described, but as an enormous mass of flesh armed with teeth.This animal attacks the balænain its places of retirement, andwith its teeth tears its young, or else attacks the females whichhave just brought forth, and, indeed, while they are still pregnant: and as they rush upon them, it pierces them just as thoughthey had been attacked by the beak of a Liburnian<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> galley.The female balænæ, devoid of all flexibility, without energy todefend themselves, and over-burdened by their own weight,weakened, too, by gestation, or else the pains of recent parturition, are well aware that their only resource is to take to flight<pb n="2366" />in the open sea and to range over the whole face of the ocean;while the orcæ, on the other hand, do all in their power to meetthem in their flight, throw themselves in their way, and killthem either cooped up in a narrow passage, or else drive themon a shoal, or dash them to pieces against the rocks. Whenthese battles are witnessed, it appears just as though the seawere infuriate against itself; not a breath of wind is there tobe felt in the bay, and yet the waves by their pantings andtheir repeated blows are heaved aloft in a way which no whirlwind could effect.</p><p>An orca has been seen even in the port of Ostia, where it wasattacked by the Emperor Claudius. It was while he wasconstructing the harbour<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> there that this orca came, attractedby some hides which, having been brought from Gaul, hadhappened to fall overboard<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> there. By feeding upon these forseveral days it had quite glutted itself, having made for itselfa, channel in the shoaly water. Here, however, the sand wasthrown up by the action of the wind to such an extent, thatthe creature found it quite impossible to turn round; and whilein the act of pursuing its prey, it was propelled by the wavestowards the shore, so that its back came to be perceived abovethe level of the water, very much resembling in appearancethe keel of a vessel turned bottom upwards. Upon this, Cæsarordered a great number of nets to be extended at the mouth ofthe harbour, from shore to shore, while he himself went therewith the prætorian cohorts, and so afforded a spectacle to theRoman people; for boats assailed the monster, while the soldiers on board showered lances upon it. I myself saw one ofthe boats<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> sunk by the water which the animal, as it respired,showered down upon it.<pb n="2367" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">As already mentioned, there is considerable doubt what fish of thewhale species is meant under this name. Cuvier says, that even at thepresent day whales are occasionally found in the Mediterranean, and saysthat there is the head of one in the Museum of Natural History, that wasthrown ashore at Martigues. He also observes, that in the year <date value="1829" authname="1829">1829</date>, onehad been cast upon the coasts of Languedoc. Ajasson suggests, that notimprobably whales once frequented the Mediterranean in great numbers,but that as commerce increased, they gradually retreated to the open ocean.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Rondelet, B xvi. c. 13, says that this animal was called "espaular"by the people of Saintonge. Cuvier is of opinion, also, that it is the sameanimal, which is also known by the name of "bootskopf," the Delphinusorca of Linnæus. (See N. 28.) This cetaceous animal, he says, is a mostdangerous enemy to the whale, which it boldly attacks, devouring its tongue,which is of a tender quality and enormous size. He thinks, however, thatthe orca taken at the port of Ostia was no other than a cachelot.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Liburna, or Liburnica, was usually a bireme, or two-oared galley,with the mast in the middle, though sometimes of larger bulk. From thedescription given of these by Varro, as quoted by Aulus Gellius, B. xvii.c. 3, they seem, as it has been remarked, somewhat similar to the lightIndian massooliah boats, which are used to cross the serf in Madras roads.Pliny tells us, in B. xvi. c. 17, that the material of which they were constructed was pine timber, as free from resin as it could possibly be obtained. The beak of these vessels was of great comparative weight, andits sharpness is evidently alluded to in the present passage, as also in B.x. c. 32. The term "Liburna" was adopted from the assistance renderedto Augustus by the Liburni at the battle of Actium.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">These works were completed by Nero the successor of Claudius, andconsisted of a new and more capacious harbour on the right arm of theTiber. It was afterwards enlarged and improved by Trajan. This harbour was simply called "Portus Romanus," or "Porbus Augusti;" andaround it there sprang up a town known as "Portus," the inhabitants ofwhich were called "Portuenses."</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Naufragiis tergorum." This may probably mean a shipwreck, inwhich some hides had fallen into the sea.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is remarked by Rezzonico, that Palermus, in the account of thisstory given by him in B. i. c. 1, has mistaken Pliny's meaning, and evidently thinks that "unum" refers to the soldiers, and not the boats en-gaged in the attack.</p></body>
