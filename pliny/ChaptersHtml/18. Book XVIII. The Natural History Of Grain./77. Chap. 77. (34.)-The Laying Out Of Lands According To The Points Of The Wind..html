<div2 type="chapter" n="77" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 77. (34.)—THE LAYING OUT OF LANDS ACCORDING TO THEPOINTS OF THE WIND.</head><p>We have already stated<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> that the umbilicus should be describedin the middle of the line. Let another line be drawntransversely through the middle of it, and it will be found torun from due east to due west; a trench cut through the landin accordance with this line is known by the name of "decumanus." Twoother lines must then be traced obliquelyacross them in the form of the letter X, in such a way as to<pb n="4115" />run exactly from right and left of the northern point to leftand right of the southern one. All these lines must passthrough the centre of the umbilicus, and all must be of corresponding length, and at equal distances. This method shouldalways be adopted in laying out land; or if it should be foundnecessary to employ it frequently, a plan<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> of it may be madein wood, sticks of equal length being fixed upon the surfaceof a small tambour,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> but perfectly round. In the methodwhich I am here explaining, it is necessary to point out oneprecaution that must always be observed by those who areunacquainted with the subject. The point that must he verified firstof all is the south, as that is always the same; butthe sun, it must be remembered, rises every day at a point inthe heavens different to that of his rising on the day before,so that the east must never be taken as the basis for tracingthe lines.</p><p>Having now ascertained the various points of the heavens,the extremity of the line that is nearest to the north, but lyingto the east of it, will indicate the solstitial rising, or, in otherwords, the rising of the sun on the longest day, as also thepoint from which the wind Aquilo<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> blows, known to the Greeksby the name of Boreas. You should plant all trees and vinesfacing this point, but take care never to plough, or sow corn,or plant in seed plots, while this wind is blowing, for it has theeffect of drying up and blasting the roots of the trees whilebeing transplanted. Be taught in time—one thing is good forgrown trees, another for them while they are but young. Norhave I forgotten the fact, that it is at this point of the heavensthat the Greeks place the wind, to which they give the nameof Cæcias; Aristotle, a man of most extensive learning, whohas assigned to Cæcias this position, explains that it is inconsequence of the convexity of the earth, that Aquilo blows inan opposite direction to the wind called Africus.</p><p>The agriculturist, however, has nothing to fear from Aquilo,in respect to the operations before mentioned, all the yearthrough; for this wind is softened by the sun in the middle of<pb n="4116" />the summer, and, changing its name, is known by that of Etesias.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>When you feel the cold, then, be on your guard; for,whatever the noxious effects that are attributed to Aquilo, themore sensibly will they be felt when the wind blows from duenorth. In Asia, Greece, Spain, the coasts of Italy, Campania,and Apulia, the trees that support the vines, as well as thevines themselves, should have an aspect towards the north-east.If you wish to have male produce, let the flock feed in sucha way, that this wind may have the opportunity of fecundating themale, whose office it is to fecundate the females. Thewind Africus, known to the Greeks by the name of Libs, blowsfrom the south-west, the opposite point to Aquilo; whenanimals, after coupling, turn their heads towards this quarter,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>you may be sure that female produce has been conceived.</p><p>The third<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>: line from the north, which we have drawntransversely through the shadow, and called by the name of"decumanus," will point due east, and from this quarter the windSubsolanus blows, by the Greeks called Apeliotes. It is tothis point that, in healthy localities, farm-houses and vineyardsare made to look. This wind is accompanied with soft, gentleshowers; Favonius, however, the wind that blows from duewest, the opposite quarter to it, is of a drier nature; by theGreeks it is known as Zephyrus. Cato has recommended thatolive-yards should look due west. It is this wind that beginsthe spring, and opens the earth; it is moderately cool, buthealthy. As soon as it begins to prevail, it indicates that thetime has arrived for pruning the vine, weeding the corn, planting trees, grafting fruit-trees, and trimming the olive; for itsbreezes are productive of the most nutritious effects.</p><p>The fourth<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> line from the north, and the one that lies nearestthe south on the eastern side, will indicate the point of thesun's rising at the winter solstice, and the wind Volturnus,known by the name of Eurus to the Greeks. This wind iswarm and dry, and beehives and vineyards, in the climates ofItaly and the Gallic provinces, should face this quarter.Directly opposite to Volturnus, the wind Corus blows; it indicatesthe point of the sun's setting at the summer solstice,<pb n="4117" />and lies on the western side next to the north. By the Greeksit is called Argestes, and is one of the very coldest of the winds,which, in fact, is the case with all the winds that blow from thenorth; this wind, too, brings hailstorms with it, for whichreason it is necessary to be on our guard against it no less thanthe north. If Volturnus begins to blow from a clear quarterof the heavens, it will not last till night; but if it isSubsolanus, it will prevail for the greater part of the night.Whatever the wind that may happen to be blowing, if it isaccompanied by heat, it will be sure to last for several days. Theearth announces the approach of Aquilo, by drying on a sudden,while on the approach of Auster, the surface becomes moistwithout any apparent cause.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In the last Chapter</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Very similar to our compass, but describing only eight points ofthe wind, instead of thirty-two.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Tympanum," a drum, similar in shape to our tambourines or elsekettle-drums.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. ii. c. 46.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or the "summer" wind.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Africus, or south-west.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or, according to our mode of expression, the "second," or "nextbut one."</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or, as we say, the "third."</p></body>
