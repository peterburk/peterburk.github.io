<div2 type="chapter" n="47" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 47.—WHETSTONES.</head><p>We must now pass on to the stones that are employed forhandicrafts, and, first of all, whetstones for sharpening iron.Of these stones there are numerous varieties; the Cretan stoneshaving been long held in the highest estimation, and the nextbest being those of Mount Taygetus, in Laconia; both ofwhich are used as hones, and require oil. Among the water-whetstones,the first rank belonged to those of Naxos, and thesecond to the stones of Armenia, both of them already<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> mentioned.The stones of Cilicia are of excellent quality, whetherused with oil or with water; those of Arsinöe,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> too, are verygood, but with water only. Whetstones have been found alsoin Italy, which with water give a remarkably keen edge; andfrom the countries beyond the Alps, we have the whetstonesknown as "passernices."<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span></p><p>To the fourth class belong the hones which give an edgeby the agency of human saliva, and are much in use in barbers'shops. They are worthless, however, for all other purposes,in consequence of their soft and brittle nature: thosefrom the district of Laminium,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> in Nearer Spain, are the bestof the kind.<pb n="6371" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In Chapter 10 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. v. cc. 22, 35, for two places of this name.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A Celtic word, probably</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. iii. c. 2.</p></body>
