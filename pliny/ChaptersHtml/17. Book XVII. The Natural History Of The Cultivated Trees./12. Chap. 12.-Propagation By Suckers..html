For by the shadeof the tree these suckers are indiscriminately stifled, as weoften see the case in the laurel, the pomegranate, the plane,the cherry, and the plum. There are some few trees, the elmand the palm for instance, in which the branches spare thesuckers; however, they never make their appearance in anyof the trees except those in which the roots, from their fondness for the sun and rain, keep close, as they range, to thesurface of the ground. It is usual not to place all these suckers at once in the ground upon the spot which they are finallyto occupy, but first to entrust them to the nursery, and toallow them to grow in seed-plots, after which they are finallytransplanted. This transplanting softens down, in a most remarkable manner, those trees even which grow wild; whetherit is that trees, like men, are naturally fond of novelty and<pb n="3464" />change of scene, or that, on leaving the spots of their originalgrowth, or to which they have been transplanted, they layaside their bad qualities and become tame, like the wild animals, the moment they are separated from the parent stock.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This passage is borrowed almost verbatim from Virgil, Georgics ii.50, <hi rend="ital">et seq.</hi></p></body>
