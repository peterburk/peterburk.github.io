The great point of its excellenceconsists in its producing exactly the tint of corn whenin a state of the freshest verdure.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> Before now, we have seen,at the spectacles exhibited by the Emperor Nero, the arena ofthe Circus entirely sanded with chrysocolla, when the princehimself, clad in a dress of the same colour, was about to exhibitas a charioteer.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span></p><p>The unlearned multitude of artisans distinguish threekinds of chrysocolla; the rough chrysocolla, which is valuedat seven denarii per pound; the middling, worth five denarii;and the bruised, also known as the "herbaceous" chrysocolla,worth three denarii per pound. Before laying on thesanded<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> chrysocolla, they underlay coats of atramentum<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>and parætonium,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> substances which make it hold, and imparta softness to the colours. The parætonium, as it isnaturally very unctuous, and, from its smoothness, extremelytenacious, is laid on first, and is then covered with a coat ofatramentum, lest the parætonium, from its extreme whiteness,should impart a paleness to the chrysocolla. The kind knownas "lutea," derives its name, it is thought, from the plantcalled "lutum;" which itself is often pounded with cæruleum<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> instead of real chrysocolla, and used for painting,<pb n="6110" />making a very inferior kind of green and extremely deceptive.<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Elutam." Though this is the reading given by the Bamberg MS.,"luteam" seems preferable; a name owing, probably, to its being colouredwith the plant "lutum," as mentioned at the end of this Chapter.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">So called, probably, from being made up into little balls resemblingthe "orobus" or vetch.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A powder, probably, prepared from "cæruleum." See the end of thepresent Chapter, and Chapter 57 of this Book. <hi rend="ital">Littré</hi> renders the words"in lomentum," kept "in the form of power," without reference to thepeculiar pigment known as "lomentum."</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Sudore resolutis."</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A strong proof that chrysocolla was a preparation from copper, andnot cobalt.

See B. xxviii. c. 72, and B. xxix. c. 5. FromSuetonius, c. 18, we learn that the Emperor Caligula, also, had the Circussanded with minium and chrysocolla. Ajasson is of opinion that thechrysocolla thus employed was a kind of yellow mica or talc.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Arenosam."
