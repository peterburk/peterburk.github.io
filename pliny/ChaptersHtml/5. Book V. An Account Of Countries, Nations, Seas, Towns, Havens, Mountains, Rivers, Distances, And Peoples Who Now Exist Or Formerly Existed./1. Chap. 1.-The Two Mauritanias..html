<div2 type="chapter" n="1" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 1.—THE TWO MAURITANIAS.</head><p>The Greeks have given the name of Libya<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> to Africa, andhave called the sea that lies in front of it the Libyan Sea.It has Egypt for its boundary, and no part of the earth isthere that has fewer gulfs or inlets, its shores extending in alengthened line from the west in an oblique direction. Thenames of its peoples, and its cities in especial, cannot possibly be pronounced with correctness, except by the aid oftheir own native tongues. Its population, too, for the mostpart dwells only in fortresses<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>.</p><p>(1.) On our entrance into Africa, we find the two Mauritanias, which, until the time of Caius Cæsar<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>, the sonof Germanicus, were kingdoms; but, suffering under hiscruelty, they were divided into two provinces. The extremepromontory of Africa, which projects into the ocean, is calledAmpelusia<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> by the Greeks. There were formerly two towns,Lissa and Cotte<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>, beyond the Pillars of Hercules; but, atthe present day, we only find that of Tingi<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>, which was for-<pb n="1375" />merly founded by Antæus, and afterwards received the nameof Traducta Julia<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>, from Claudius Cæsar, when he established a colony there. It is thirty miles distant fromBelon<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>, a town of Bætica, where the passage across is theshortest. At a distance of twenty-five miles from Tingi,upon the shores of the ocean<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>, we come to Julia Constantia Zilis<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>, a colony of Augustus. This place is exemptfrom all subjection to the kings of Mauritania, and is included in the legal jurisdiction of Bætica. Thirty-twomiles distant from Julia Constantia is Lixos<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>, which wasmade a Roman colony by Claudius Cæsar, and which hasbeen the subject of such wondrous fables, related by thewriters of antiquity. At this place, according to thestory, was the palace of Antaeus; this was the scene of hiscombat with Hercules, and here were the gardens of theHesperides<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>. An arm of the sea flows into the land here,<pb n="1376" />with a serpentine channel, and, from the nature of thelocality, this is interpreted at the present day as having beenwhat was really represented by the story of the dragonkeeping guard there. This tract of water surrounds anisland, the only spot which is never overflowed by the tidesof the sea, although not quite so elevated as the rest of theland in its vicinity. Upon this island, also, there is still inexistence the altar of Hercules; but of the grove that borethe golden fruit, there are no traces left, beyond some wildolive-trees. People will certainly be the less surprised atthe marvellous falsehoods of the Greeks, which have beenrelated about this place and the river Lixos<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>, when they reflect that some of our own<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> countrymen as well, and thattoo very recently, have related stories in reference to themhardly less monstrous; how that this city is remarkable forits power and extensive influence, and how that it is evengreater than Great Carthage ever was; how, too, that it issituate just opposite to Carthage, and at an almost immeasurable distance from Tingi, together with other detailsof a similar nature, all of which Cornelius Nepos has believedwith the most insatiate credulity<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>.</p><p>In the interior, at a distance of forty miles from Lixos, isBabba<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span>, surnamed Julia Campestris, another colony of Augustus; and, at a distance of seventy-five, a third, called Banasa<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span>,<pb n="1377" />with the surname of Valentia. At a distance of thirty-fivemiles from this last is the town of Volubilis, which is justthat distance also from both<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> seas. On the coast, at adistance of fifty miles from Lixos, is the river Subur<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span>, whichflows past the colony of Banasa, a fine river, and availablefor the purposes of navigation. At the same distance fromit is the city of Sala<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span>, situate on a river which bears thesame name, a place which stands upon the very verge of thedesert, and though infested by troops of elephants, is muchmore exposed to the attacks of the nation of the Autololes,through whose country lies the road to Mount Atlas, themost fabulous<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> locality even in Africa.</p><p>It is from the midst of the sands, according to the story,that this mountain<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> raises its head to the heavens; ruggedand craggy on the side which looks toward the shores of theocean to which it has given its name, while on that whichfaces the interior of Africa it is shaded by dense grovesof trees, and refreshed by flowing streams; fruits of allkinds springing up there spontaneously to such an extent,as to more than satiate every possible desire. Throughoutthe daytime, no inhabitant is to be seen; all is silent, likethat dreadful stillness which reigns in the desert. A religioushorror steals imperceptibly over the feelings of those whoapproach, and they feel themselves smitten with awe at thestupendous aspect of its summit, which reaches beyond theclouds, and well nigh approaches the very orb of the moon.At night, they say, it gleams with fires innumerable lighted<pb n="1378" />up; it is then the scene of the gambols of the Ægipans<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span> andthe Satyr crew, while it re-echoes with the notes of the fluteand the pipe, and the clash of drums and cymbals. All thisis what authors of high character have stated, in addition tothe labours which Hercules and Perseus there experienced.The space which intervenes before you arrive at this mountain is immense, and the country quite unknown.</p><p>There formerly existed some Commentaries written byHanno<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span>, a Carthaginian general, who was commanded, inthe most flourishing times of the Punic state, to explorethe sea-coast of Africa. The greater part of the Greekand Roman writers have followed him, and have related,among other fabulous stories, that many cities there werefounded by him, of which no remembrance, nor yet theslightest vestige, now exists.</p><p>While Scipio Æmilianus held the command in Sicily,Polybius the historian received a fleet from him for thepurpose of proceeding on a voyage of discovery in this partof the world. He relates, that beyond<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span> Mount Atlas, pro-<pb n="1379" />ceeding in a westerly direction, there are forests filled withwild beasts, peculiar to the soil of Africa, as far as theriver Anatis<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span>, a distance of 485 miles, Lixos being distantfrom it 205 miles. Agrippa says, that Lixos is distant fromthe Straits of Gades 112 miles. After it we come to agulf which is called the Gulf of Saguti<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span>, a town situate onthe Promontory of Mulelacha<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span>, the rivers Subur and Salat<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span>,and the port of Rutubis<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span>, distant from Lixos 213 milesWe then come to the Promontory of the Sun<span id="ref_31"><a href="#note_31">[31]</a></span>, the port ofRisardir<span id="ref_32"><a href="#note_32">[32]</a></span>, the Gætulian Autololes, the river Cosenus<span id="ref_33"><a href="#note_33">[33]</a></span>, thenations of the Selatiti and the Masati, the river Masathat<span id="ref_34"><a href="#note_34">[34]</a></span>,and the river Darat<span id="ref_35"><a href="#note_35">[35]</a></span>, in which crocodiles are found. Afterthis we come to a large gulf, 616<span id="ref_36"><a href="#note_36">[36]</a></span> miles in extent, which isenclosed by a promontory of Mount Barce<span id="ref_37"><a href="#note_37">[37]</a></span>, which runsout in a westerly direction, and is called Surrentium<span id="ref_38"><a href="#note_38">[38]</a></span>.Next comes the river Salsus<span id="ref_39"><a href="#note_39">[39]</a></span>, beyond which lie the Æthiopian Perorsi, at the back of whom are the Pharusii<span id="ref_40"><a href="#note_40">[40]</a></span>, who<pb n="1380" />are bordered upon by the Gætulian Daræ<span id="ref_41"><a href="#note_41">[41]</a></span>, lying in theinterior. Upon the coast again, we find the ÆthiopianDaratitæ, and the river Bambotus<span id="ref_42"><a href="#note_42">[42]</a></span>, teeming with crocodiles and hippopotami. From this river there is a continuous range<span id="ref_43"><a href="#note_43">[43]</a></span> of mountains till we come to the one whichis known by the name of Theon Ochema<span id="ref_44"><a href="#note_44">[44]</a></span>, from which to theHesperian Promontory<span id="ref_45"><a href="#note_45">[45]</a></span> is a voyage of ten days and nights;and in the middle of this space he<span id="ref_46"><a href="#note_46">[46]</a></span> has placed Mount Atlas,which by all other writers has been stated to be in the extreme parts of Mauritania.</p><p>The Roman arms, for the first time, pursued their conquests into Mauritania, under the Emperor Claudius, whenthe freedman Ædemon took up arms to avenge the death ofKing Ptolemy<span id="ref_47"><a href="#note_47">[47]</a></span>, who had been put to death by Caius Cæsar;<pb n="1381" />and it is a well-known fact, that on the flight of the barbarians our troops reached Mount Atlas. It became a boast,not only among men of consular rank, and generals selectedfrom the senate, who at that time held the command, butamong persons of equestrian rank as well, who after thatperiod held the government there, that they had penetrated asfar as Mount Atlas. There are, as we have already stated, fiveRoman colonies in this province; and it may very possibly appear, if we listen only to what report says, that this mountainis easily accessible. Upon trial, however, it has been prettygenerally shown, that all such statements are utterly fallacious; and it is too true, that men in high station, whenthey are disinclined to take the trouble of inquiring intothe truth, through a feeling of shame at their ignorance arcnot averse to be guilty of falsehood; and never is implicitcredence more readily given, than when a falsehood is supported by the authority of some personage of high consideration. For my own part, I am far less surprised that there arestill some facts remaining undiscovered by men of the equestrian order, and even those among them who have attainedsenatorial rank, than that the love of luxury has left anything unascertained; the impulse of which must be greatindeed, and most powerfully felt, when the very forests areransacked for their ivory and citron-wood<span id="ref_48"><a href="#note_48">[48]</a></span>, and all the rocksof Gætulia are searched for the murex and the purple.</p><p>From the natives, however, we learn, that on the coast, ata distance of 150 miles from the Salat, the river Asana<span id="ref_49"><a href="#note_49">[49]</a></span> presents itself; its waters are salt, but it is remarkable for itsfine harbour. They also say that after this we come to ariver known by the name of Fut<span id="ref_50"><a href="#note_50">[50]</a></span>, and then, after crossinganother called Vior which lies on the road, at a distance of200 miles we arrive at Dyris<span id="ref_51"><a href="#note_51">[51]</a></span>, such being the name which intheir language they give to Mount Atlas. According to their<pb n="1382" />story there are still existing in its vicinity many vestiges whichtend to prove that the locality was once inhabited; such asthe remains of vineyards and plantations of palm-trees.</p><p>Suetonius Paulinus<span id="ref_52"><a href="#note_52">[52]</a></span>, whom we have seen Consul in ourown time, was the first Roman general who advanced adistance of some miles beyond Mount Atlas. He has givenus the same information as we have received from othersources with reference to the extraordinary height of thismountain, and at the same time he has stated that all thelower parts about the foot of it are covered with denseand lofty forests composed of trees of species hitherto unknown. The height of these trees, he says, is remarkable;the trunks are without knots, and of a smooth and glossysurface; the foliage is like that of the cypress, and besidessending forth a powerful odour, they are covered with aflossy down, from which, by the aid of art, a fine cloth mighteasily be manufactured, similar to the textures made from theproduce of the silk-worm. He informs us that the summitof this mountain is covered with snow even in summer, andsays that having arrived there after a march of ten days, heproceeded some distance beyond it as far as a river whichbears the name of Ger<span id="ref_53"><a href="#note_53">[53]</a></span>; the road being through desertscovered with a black sand<span id="ref_54"><a href="#note_54">[54]</a></span>, from which rocks that bore theappearance of having been exposed to the action of fire, projected every here and there; localities rendered quite uninhabitable by the intensity of the heat, as he himself experienced,<pb n="1383" />although it was in the winter season that he visited them.We also learn from the same source that the people whoinhabit the adjoining forests, which are full of all kinds ofelephants, wild beasts, and serpents, have the name of Canarii; from the circumstance that they partake of their foodin common with the canine race, and share with it theentrails of wild beasts.</p><p>It is a well-known fact, that adjoining to these localitiesis a nation of Æthiopians, which bears the name of Perorsi.Juba, the father of Ptolemy, who was the first king<span id="ref_55"><a href="#note_55">[55]</a></span> whoreigned over both the Mauritanias, and who has been renderedeven more famous by the brilliancy of his learning than byhis kingly rank, has given us similar information relative toMount Atlas, and states that a certain herb grows there,which has received the name of 'euphorbia'<span id="ref_56"><a href="#note_56">[56]</a></span> from that of hisphysician, who was the first to discover it. Juba extols withwondrous praises the milky juice of this plant as tending toimprove the sight, and acting as a specific against the bitesof serpents and all kinds of poison; and to this subject alonehe has devoted an entire book. Thus much, if indeed notmore than enough, about Mount Atlas.</p><p>(2.) The province of Tingitana is 170 miles in length<span id="ref_57"><a href="#note_57">[57]</a></span>.Of the nations in this province the principal one was formerly that of the Mauri<span id="ref_58"><a href="#note_58">[58]</a></span>, who have given to it the name ofMauritania, and have been by many writers called theMaurusii<span id="ref_59"><a href="#note_59">[59]</a></span>. This nation has been greatly weakened by thedisasters of war, and is now dwindled down to a few families only<span id="ref_60"><a href="#note_60">[60]</a></span>. Next to the Mauri was formerly the nation of<pb n="1384" />the Massæsyli<span id="ref_61"><a href="#note_61">[61]</a></span>; they in a similar manner have become extinct. Their country is now occupied by the Gætulian nations<span id="ref_62"><a href="#note_62">[62]</a></span>, the Baniuræ<span id="ref_63"><a href="#note_63">[63]</a></span>, the Autololes<span id="ref_64"><a href="#note_64">[64]</a></span>, by far the most powerful people among them all, and the Vesuni, who formerlywere a part of the Autololes, but have now separated fromthem, and, turning their steps towards the Æthiopians<span id="ref_65"><a href="#note_65">[65]</a></span>,have formed a distinct nation of their own. This province,in the mountainous district which lies on its eastern sideproduces elephants, as also on the heights of Mount Abyla<span id="ref_66"><a href="#note_66">[66]</a></span>and among those elevations which, from the similarity oftheir height, are called the Seven Brothers<span id="ref_67"><a href="#note_67">[67]</a></span>. Joining therange of Abyla these mountains overlook the Straits of Gades.At the extremity of this chain begin the shores of the inland sea<span id="ref_68"><a href="#note_68">[68]</a></span> and we come to the Tamuda<span id="ref_69"><a href="#note_69">[69]</a></span>, a navigable stream,with the site of a former town of the same name, and then<pb n="1385" />the river Laud<span id="ref_70"><a href="#note_70">[70]</a></span>, which is also navigable for vessels, the townand port of Rhysaddir<span id="ref_71"><a href="#note_71">[71]</a></span>, and Malvane<span id="ref_72"><a href="#note_72">[72]</a></span>, a navigable stream.</p><p>The city of Siga<span id="ref_73"><a href="#note_73">[73]</a></span>, formerly the residence of King Syphax, liesopposite to that of Malaca<span id="ref_74"><a href="#note_74">[74]</a></span> in Spain: it now belongs to thesecond<span id="ref_75"><a href="#note_75">[75]</a></span> Mauritania. But these countries, I should remark,for a long time retained the names of their respective kings,the further Mauritania being called the "land of Bogud<span id="ref_76"><a href="#note_76">[76]</a></span>,"while that which is now called Cæsariensis was called the"country of Bocchus." After passing Siga we come to thehaven called "Portus Magnus<span id="ref_77"><a href="#note_77">[77]</a></span>" from its great extent, with atown whose people enjoy the rights of Roman citizens, andthen the river Mulucha<span id="ref_78"><a href="#note_78">[78]</a></span>, which served as the limit betweenthe territory of Bocchus and that of the Massæsyli. Nextto this is Quiza Xenitana<span id="ref_79"><a href="#note_79">[79]</a></span>, a town founded by strangers,and Arsenaria<span id="ref_80"><a href="#note_80">[80]</a></span>, a place with the ancient Latin rights, threemiles distant from the sea. We then come to Cartenna<span id="ref_81"><a href="#note_81">[81]</a></span>, a<pb n="1386" />colony founded under Augustus by the second legion, andGunugum<span id="ref_82"><a href="#note_82">[82]</a></span>, another colony founded by the same emperor, aprætorian cohort being established there; the Promontoryof Apollo<span id="ref_83"><a href="#note_83">[83]</a></span>, and a most celebrated city, now calledCæsarea<span id="ref_84"><a href="#note_84">[84]</a></span>, but formerly known by the name of Iol; thisplace was the residence of King Juba, and received therights of a colony from the now deified Emperor Claudius.Oppidum Novum<span id="ref_85"><a href="#note_85">[85]</a></span> is the next place; a colony of veteranswas established here by command of the same emperor.Next to it is Tipasa<span id="ref_86"><a href="#note_86">[86]</a></span>, which has received Latin rights, asalso Icasium<span id="ref_87"><a href="#note_87">[87]</a></span>, which has been presented by the EmperorVespasianus with similar rights; Rusconiæ<span id="ref_88"><a href="#note_88">[88]</a></span>, a colonyfounded by Augustus; Rusucurium<span id="ref_89"><a href="#note_89">[89]</a></span>, honoured by Claudiuswith the rights of Roman citizens; Ruzacus<span id="ref_90"><a href="#note_90">[90]</a></span>, a colonyfounded by Augustus; Salde<span id="ref_91"><a href="#note_91">[91]</a></span>, another colony foundedby the same emperor; Igilgili<span id="ref_92"><a href="#note_92">[92]</a></span>, another; and the town of<pb n="1387" />Tucca<span id="ref_93"><a href="#note_93">[93]</a></span>, situate on the sea-shore and upon the river Ampsaga.In the interior are the colony of Augusta, also calledSuccabar<span id="ref_94"><a href="#note_94">[94]</a></span>, Tubusuptus<span id="ref_95"><a href="#note_95">[95]</a></span>, the cities of Timici and Tigavæ<span id="ref_96"><a href="#note_96">[96]</a></span>,the rivers Sardabal<span id="ref_97"><a href="#note_97">[97]</a></span>, Aves<span id="ref_98"><a href="#note_98">[98]</a></span>, and Nabar<span id="ref_99"><a href="#note_99">[99]</a></span>, the nation of theMacurebi, the river Usar<span id="ref_100"><a href="#note_100">[100]</a></span>, and the nation of the Nababes.The river Ampsaga is distant from Cæsarea 322<span id="ref_101"><a href="#note_101">[101]</a></span> miles. Thelength of the two Mauritanias is 1038, and their breadth467 miles.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Not reckoning under that appellation the country of Egypt, which was more generally looked upon as forming part of Asia.

His tomb, which formed a hill, in the shape of a man stretched out at full length, was shown near the town of Tingis to a late period. It was also believed, that whenever a portion of the earth covering the body was taken away, it rained until the hole was filled up again. Sertorius is said to have dug away a portion of the hill; but, on discovering a skeleton sixty cubits in length, he was struck with horror, and had it immediately covered again.

As a foundation for one part of the stories here men- tioned, Brotier suggests the fact, that as the Kabyles, or mountain tribes, are in the habit of retiring to their dwellings and reposing during the heat of the day, it would not, consequently, be improbable that they would devote the night to their amusements, lighting up fires, and dancing to the music of drums and cymbals.</p><p><span id="note_24"><a href="#ref_24">24. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Under his name we still possess a "Periplus," or account of a voyage round a part of Libya.
