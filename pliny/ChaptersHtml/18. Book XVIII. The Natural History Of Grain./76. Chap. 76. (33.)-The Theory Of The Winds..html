<div2 type="chapter" n="76" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 76. (33.)—THE THEORY OF THE WINDS.</head><p>The theory of the winds<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> is of a somewhat more intricatenature. After observing the quarter in which the sun riseson any given day, at the sixth<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> hour of the day take yourposition in such a manner as to have the point of the sun'srising on your left; you will then have the south directlyfacing you, and the north at your back: a line drawn througha field in this direction<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> is called the "cardinal"<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> line. Theobserver must then turn round, so as to look upon his shadow,for it will be behind him. Having thus changed his position,so as to bring the point of the sun's rising on that day to theright, and that of his setting to the left, it will be the sixthhour of the day, at the moment when the shadow straightbefore him is the shortest. Through the middle of thisshadow, taken lengthwise, a furrow must be traced in theground with a hoe, or else a line drawn with ashes, sometwenty feet in length, say; in the middle of this line, or, inother words, at the tenth foot in it, a small circle must thenbe described: to this circle we may give the name of the"umbilicus," or "navel." That point in the line which lieson the side of the head of the shadow will be the point fromwhich the north wind blows. You who are engaged in pruning trees, beit your care that the incisions made in the wooddo not face this point; nor should the vine-trees<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> or the vineshave this aspect, except in the climates of Africa,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> Cyrenæ, orEgypt. When the wind blows, too, from this point, you mustnever plough, nor, in fact, attempt any other of the operationsof which we shall have to make mention.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span></p><p>That part of the line which lies between the umbilicus andthe feet of the shadow will look towards the south, and indicate thepoint from which the south wind<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> blows, to which,as already mentioned,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> the Greeks have given the name ofNotus. When the wind comes from this quarter, you, hasbandman, mustnever fell wood or touch the vine. In Italy<pb n="4114" />this wind is either humid or else of a burning heat, and inAfrica it is accompanied with intense heat<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> and fine clearweather. In Italy the bearing branches should be trained toface this quarter, but the incisions made in the trees or vineswhen pruned must never face it. Let those be on their guardagainst this wind upon the four<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> days at the rising of theVergiliæ, who are engaged in planting the olive, as well asthose who are employed in the operations of grafting or inoculating.</p><p>It will be as well, too, here to give some advice, in referenceto the climate of Italy, as to certain precautions to be observedat certain hours of the day. You, woodman, must never lopthe branches in the middle of the day; and you, shepherd,when you see midday approaching in summer, and the shadowgradually decreasing, drive your flocks from out of the suninto some well-shaded spot. When you lead the flocks to pasture insummer, let them face the west before midday,<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> andafter that time, the east: if this precaution is not adopted,calamitous results will ensue; the same, too, if the flocks areled in winter or spring to pastures covered with dew. Normust you let them feed with their faces to the north, as alreadymentioned;<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> for the wind will either close their eyes or elsemake them bleared, and they will (lie of looseness. If you wishto have females,<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> you should let the dams have their faces towardsthe north while being covered.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Many of his statements are drawn from Aristotle's Treatise, "DeMundo."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Our mid-day.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From due north to due south.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cardo.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Arbusta."
