The people of Parthia, however, prefer applying a hen's brains to the wound. Poultry broth, too, is highlycelebrated as a cure, and is found marvellously useful in manyother cases. Panthers and lions will never touch persons whohave been rubbed with it, more particularly if it has beenflavoured with garlic. The broth that is made of an old cockis more relaxing to the bowels; it is very good also for chronicfevers, numbness of the limbs, cold shiverings and maladies ofthe joints, pains also in the head, defluxions of the eyes,flatulency, sickness at stomach, incipient tenesmus, livercomplaints, diseases of the kidneys, affections of the bladder,indigestion, and asthma. Hence there are several recipes forpreparing this broth; it being most efficacious when boiled upwith sea-cabbage,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> salted tunny,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> capers, parsley, the plantmercurialis,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> polypodium,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> or dill. The best plan, however,is to boil the cock or capon with the plants above-mentioned inthree congii of water, down to three semi-sextarii; after whichit should be left to cool in the open air, and given at the propermoment, just after an emetic has been administered.</p><p>And here I must not omit to mention one marvellous fact,even though it bears no reference to medicine: if the flesh ofpoultry is mingled with gold<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> in a state of fusion, it willabsorb the metal and consume it, thus showing that it actsas a poison upon gold. If young twigs are made up into acollar and put round a cock's neck, it will never crow.<pb n="5400" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxii. c. 33.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Cybium,."
