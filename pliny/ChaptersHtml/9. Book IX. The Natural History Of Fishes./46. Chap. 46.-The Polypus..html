<div2 type="chapter" n="46" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 46.—THE POLYPUS.</head><p>There are numerous kinds of polypi. The land<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> polypus islarger than that of the sea; they all of them use their arms<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> asfeet and hands; and in coupling they employ the tail, which isforked<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and sharp. The polypus has a sort of passage in theback,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> by which it lets in and discharges the water, and which<pb n="2418" />it shifts from side to side, sometimes carrying it on the right,and sometimes on the left. It swims obliquely,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> with thehead on one side, which is of surprising hardness while theanimal is alive, being puffed out with air.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> In addition tothis, they have cavities<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> dispersed throughout the claws,by means of which, through suction, they can adhere toobjects; which they hold, with the head upwards, so tightly,that they cannot be torn away. They cannot attach themselves, however, to the bottom of the sea, and their retentive powers are weaker in the larger ones. These are theonly<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> soft fish that come on dry land, and then only wherethe surface is rugged: a smooth surface they will not comenear. They feed upon the flesh of shell-fish, the shells ofwhich they can easily break in the embrace of their arms:hence it is that their retreat may be easily detected by the piecesof shell which lie before it. Although, in other respects, thisis looked upon as a remarkably stupid kind of animal, so muchso, that it will swim towards the hand of a man, to a certainextent in its own domestic matters it manifests considerableintelligence. It carries its prey to its home, and after eatingall the flesh, throws out the debris, and then pursues suchsmall fish as may chance to swim towards them. It alsochanges its colour<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> according to the aspect of the place whereit is, and more especially when it is alarmed. The notion isentirely unfounded that it gnaws<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> its own arms; for it is fromthe congers that this mischance befalls it; but it is no other<pb n="2419" />than true that its arms shoot forth again, like the tail in thecolotus<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> and the lizard.<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This, as Hardouin says, is the polypus which is found on the seashore, and which more frequently comes on dry land than the other kinds.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The arms of the polypus have numerous names with the Latin authors.Ovid calls them "flagella,"—"whips;" others again, "cirri"—"curls;""pedes"—"feet" "crura"—"legs;" and "crines"—"hair."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This, Cuvier says, is quite unintelligible; for all the polypi have anoval body, of the shape of a bag, and there is nothing in them that bearsany resemblance to a tail, forked or otherwise.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This channel, Cuvier says, is in form of a funnel reversed, by meansof which the animal draws in and ejects the water that is requisite for itsrespiration, and discharges the ink and other excretions. It is in the forepart of the body, and at the orifice of the bag, and not on the back, asPliny says; but, as Cuvier remarks, it was very easy for a person to bedeceived in this matter, as the head, being in form of a cylinder, andfringed with the so-called feet, cannot be said to be distinguished into anupper and lower side.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. iv. c. 2, says that the animal is obliged todo so, on account of the situation of the eyes.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">But Aristotle says, <foreign lang="greek">kaqa/per e)mpefushme/nhn,</foreign> "<hi rend="ital">as though</hi> it werepuffed out with air."</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Acetabulis." The acetabulum was properly a vinegar cruet, inshape resembling an inverted cone; from a supposed similarity in theappearance. it is here applied to the suckers of the polypus. The Greekname is <foreign lang="greek">kotulhdw\n.</foreign></p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. ix. c. 59.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier says, that the changes of colour of the skin of the polypusare continual, and succeed each other with an extreme rapidity; but thatit has not been observed, any more than the chameleon, to take the colourof objects in its vicinity.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This notion is mentioned by Athenæus, Pherecrates, Alcæus, Hesiod,Oppian, and Ælian.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier says, that Pliny states, in B. xxix. c. 28, that the colotis, orcolotes of the Greeks, is the same as their ascalabotes, the "stellio" of theLatins. This stellio is the same as the "gecko" of the moderns, and thespecies known in Italy and Greece is the same as the "wall gecko" of theFrench, or the tarente of the Provencals. From what Pliny says hereabout its tail, it would appear to have been a lizard; but its identitywith the stellio, Cuvier says, is very doubtful. It will be mentioned moreat length in B. xi. c. 31.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is very true, Cuvier says, that the tail of the gecko and lizard willgrow again after it has been cut off, but without vertebra. As to thearms of the polypus, he says, it is very possible, seeing that the horns ofthe snail, which belongs to the same family, will grow again.</p></body>
