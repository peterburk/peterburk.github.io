<div2 type="chapter" n="14" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 14. (14.)ÑTHIRTY DIFFERENT KINDS OF POMES. AT WHATPERIOD FOREIGN FRUITS WERE FIRST INTRODUCED INTO ITALY,AND WHENCE.</head><p>There are numerous varieties of pomes. Of the citron<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> wehave already made mention when describing its tree; theGreeks gave it the name of "Medica,"<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> from its native country. The jujube<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>-tree and the tuber<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> are equally exotics;indeed, they have, both of them, been introduced only of lateyears into Italy; the latter from Africa, the former from Syria.Sextus Papinius, whom we have seen consul,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> introduced themboth in the latter years of the reign of Augustus, producedfrom slips which he had grown within his camp. The fruitof the jujube more nearly resembles a berry than an apple:the tree sets off a terrace<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> remarkably well, and it is not uncommon to see whole woods of it climbing up to the very roofsof the houses.</p><p>Of the tuber there are two varieties; the white, and the onecalled "syricum,"<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> from its colour. Those fruits, too, maybe almost pronounced exotic which grow nowhere in Italy butin the territory of Verona, and are known as the wool-fruit.<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>They are covered with a woolly down; this is found, it is true,to a very considerable extent, on both the strutheum variety ofquince and the peach, but still it has given its name to thisparticular fruit, which is recommended to us by no otherremarkable quality.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xii. c. 7.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Of Media.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Its fruit will ripen in France, as far north as Tours. It is the Zizyphus vulgaris of Lamarck. It resembles a small plum, and is sometimes usedas a sweetmeat. The confection sold as jujube paste is not the dried jellyof this fruit, but merely gum arabic and sugar, coloured.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A variety of the jujube, FŽe is inclined to think. A nut-peach hasalso been suggested.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A.U.C. 779.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or perhaps embankment: "agger."</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A reddish colour. For the composition of this colour, see B.xxxv. c. 24.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Lanata;" perhaps rather the "downy" fruit; a variety of quince,FŽe thinks. Pliny probably had never seen this fruit, in his opinion,and only speaks after Virgil, Eel. ii. 1. 51. "Ipse ego cana legam teneralanugine mala."</p></body>
