Of all serpents, injuries inflicted by the aspare the most incurable; and their venom, if it comes in contactwith the blood or a recent wound, produces instantaneous death.If, on the other hand, it touches an old sore, its fatal effectsare not so immediate. Taken internally, in however large aquantity, the venom is not injurious,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> as it has no corrosive properties; for which reason it is that the flesh of animals killedby it may be eaten with impunity.</p><p>I should hesitate in giving circulation to a prescription forinjuries inflicted by the asp, were it not that M. Varro, thenin the eighty-third year of his age, has left a statement to theeffect that it is a most efficient remedy for wounds inflicted bythis reptile, for the person stung to drink his own urine.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is the fact.</p></body>
