<div2 type="chapter" n="15" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 15. (14.)—JUDÆA.</head><p>Beyond Idumæa and Samaria, Judæa extends far andwide. That part of it which joins up to Syria<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> is calledGalilæa, while that which is nearest to Arabia and Egyptbears the name of Peræa<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>. This last is thickly covered withrugged mountains, and is separated from the rest of Judæaby the river Jordanes. The remaining part of Judæa isdivided into ten Toparchies, which we will mention in thefollowing order:—That of Hiericus<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>, covered with groves of<pb n="1428" />palm-trees, and watered by numerous springs, and those ofEmmaüs<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, Lydda<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>, Joppe, Acrabatena<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>, Gophna<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>, Thamna<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>,Bethleptephene<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>, Orina<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>, in which formerly stood Hierosolyma<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>,by far the most famous city, not of Judæa only,but of the East, and Herodium<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>, with a celebrated townof the same name.</p><p>(15.) The river Jordanes<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> rises from the spring of Panias<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>,which has given its surname to Cæsarea, of which we shall<pb n="1429" />have occasion to speak<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>. This is a delightful stream, and,so far as the situation of the localities will allow of, windsalong<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> in its course and lingers among the dwellers uponits banks. With the greatest reluctance, as it were, itmoves onward towards Asphaltites<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span>, a lake of a gloomy andunpropitious nature, by which it is at last swallowed up,and its be praised waters are lost sight of on being mingledwith the pestilential streams of the lake. For this reasonit is that, as soon as ever the valleys through which it runsafford it the opportunity, it discharges itself into a lake, bymany writers known as Genesara<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span>, sixteen miles in lengthand six wide; which is skirted by the pleasant towns ofJulias<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> and Hippo<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> on the east, of Tarichea<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> on the south(a name which is by many persons given to the lake itself),and of Tiberias<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> on the west, the hot springs<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span> of which areso conducive to the restoration of health.</p><p>(16.) Asphaltites<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span> produces nothing whatever except bitu-<pb n="1430" />men, to which indeed it owes its name. The bodies ofanimals will not sink<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span> in its waters, and even those of bullsand camels float there. In length it exceeds 100 milesbeing at its greatest breadth twenty-five, and at its smallestsix. Arabia of the Nomades<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span> faces it on the east, andMachærus on the south<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span>, at one time, next to Hierosolyma,the most strongly fortified place in Judæa. On the sameside lies Callirrhoë<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span>, a warm spring, remarkable for its medicinalqualities, and which, by its name, indicates the celebrityits waters have gained.</p><p>(17.) Lying on the west of Asphaltites, and sufficientlydistant to escape its noxious exhalations, are the Esseni<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span>, a<pb n="1431" />people that live apart from the world, and marvellous beyondall others throughout the whole earth, for they have no womenamong them; to sexual desire they are strangers; moneythey have none; the palm-trees are their only companions.Day after day, however, their numbers are fully recruited bymultitudes of strangers that resort to them, driven thitherto adopt their usages by the tempests of fortune, and weariedwith the miseries of life. Thus it is, that through thousandsof ages, incredible to relate, this people eternally prolongsits existence, without a single birth taking place there; sofruitful a source of population to it is that weariness oflife which is felt by others. Below this people was formerlythe town of Engadda<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span>, second only to Hierosolyma inthe fertility of its soil and its groves of palm-trees; now,like it, it is another heap of ashes. Next to it we come toMasada<span id="ref_31"><a href="#note_31">[31]</a></span>, a fortress on a rock, not far from Lake Asphaltites.Thus much concerning Judæa.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Antiochian Syria.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Peræa was the general name of that part of Palæstina which lay east of the river Jordan; but more usually, in a restricted sense, it signified a part only of that region, namely the district between the rivers Hieromax on the north, and Arnon on the south.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Jericho, so often mentioned in Scripture. It was celebrated for its palm-grove, which was presented by Antony to Cleopatra. A Bedouin encampment called Riha is all that now occupies its site.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A city eight or ten miles from the village Emmaüs of the New Testament. It was called Nicopolis, in commemoration, it has been suggested, of the destruction of Jerusalem. Its site is still marked by a village called Ammious, on the road from Jerusalem to Jaffa.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">So often mentioned in the New Testament. This town lay to the S.E. of Joppa, and N.W. of Jerusalem, at the junction of several roads which lead from the sea-coast. It was destroyed by the Romans in the Jewish war, but was soon after rebuilt, and called Diospolis. A village called Lud occupies its site.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">So called from Acrabbim, its chief town, situate nine miles from Nicopolis. The toparchy of Acrabbim, which formerly formed part of Samaria, was the most northerly of those of Judæa.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Situate in the country of Benjamin. Josephus reckons it second in importance only to Jerusalem, from which, according to Eusebius, it was distant fifteen miles, on the road to the modern Nablous. That author also identifies it with the Eshcol of Scripture. Its site is marked by a small Christian village, called by the natives Jufia.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Like the two preceding ones, this toparchy for a long time belonged to Samaria. Thamna, or Thamnis, was the Timnath-Serah in Mount Ephraim, mentioned in Joshua xix. 50, and xxiv. 30, as the place where Joshua was buried.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The toparchy of Bethleptepha of other authors. It appears to have been situate in the south of Judæa, and in that part which is by Josephus commonly called Idumæa. Reland has remarked, that the name resembles Beth-lebaoth, a city of the tribe of Simeon, mentioned in Joshua xix. 6.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From the Greek, meaning the "mountain district," or the "hill country," as mentioned in Luke i. 39.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "Sacred Solyma."</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A fortress of Palæstina, erected by Herod the Great, at a distance of about sixty stadia from Jerusalem, and not far from Tekoa. Its site has been identified by modern travellers with El-Furedis, or the Paradise; probably the same as the spot called the "Frank Mountain," on the top of which the ruined walls of the fortress are still to be seen.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Called by the Arabs Bahr-el-Arden.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Situate on Mount Panias, or Paneas, on the range of Anti-Libanus.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In C 16 of the present Book.</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">On the contrary, as Parisot observes, the Jordan runs in a straight line almost into the Dead Sea.</p><p><span id="note_17"><a href="#ref_17">17. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Lake of Sodom, or the Dead Sea, in which the Cities of the Plain were swallowed up.</p><p><span id="note_18"><a href="#ref_18">18. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In Scripture also called the Lake Tiberias, and the Sea of Gennesareth, or Chinnereth. It is now called the Sea of Tabariah, or Tabarieh.</p><p><span id="note_19"><a href="#ref_19">19. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The one of the two Bethsaidas, which was situate on the north of the Sea of Tiberias. It was enlarged by Philip the Tetrarch, who greatly beautified it, and changed its name to Julias, in honour of the daughter of Augustus, the wife of Tiberius. It is generally supposed by the learned world, that this was not the Bethsaida mentioned so often in the New Testament. Its ruins are probably those now seen on a hill called Et-Tell, on the north-western extremity of the lake.</p><p><span id="note_20"><a href="#ref_20">20. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">On the east of the lake. From it the district of Hippene took its name.</p><p><span id="note_21"><a href="#ref_21">21. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Its ruins are to be seen at El-Kereh, on the south side of the lake. It was strongly fortified, and made a vigorous resistance against the Romans in the Jewish War. It received its name from the great quantities of fish which were salted there, <foreign lang="greek">ta/rixoi.</foreign></p><p><span id="note_22"><a href="#ref_22">22. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Tabariah, or Tabarieh, a miserable village. It was built by Herod Antipas, in honour of the Emperor Tiberius. After the destruction of Jerusalem, it became the seat of the Jewish Sanhedrim.</p><p><span id="note_23"><a href="#ref_23">23. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">These hot springs are by Josephus called Emmaüs, probably a form of the Hebrew name Hammath. Dr. Robinson, in his Biblical Researches, identifies this with the town of Hammath, of the tribe of Naphthali, mentioned in Joshua xix. 35.</p><p><span id="note_24"><a href="#ref_24">24. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From the Greek <foreign lang="greek">a)/sfaltos.</foreign></p><p><span id="note_25"><a href="#ref_25">25. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is an exaggeration, though it is the fact that many heavy substances, which in ordinary water would sink immediately, will float on the surface of this lake. It has been suggested, that the story here mentioned arose from the circumstance of the name of 'bulls,' or 'cows,' having been applied by the ancient Nabatæi to the large masses of asphaltum which floated on its surface.</p><p><span id="note_26"><a href="#ref_26">26. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The country of the Arabian Scenitæ, or "tent people."</p><p><span id="note_27"><a href="#ref_27">27. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It lay on the east of the Dead Sea, and not the south, as here mentioned by Pliny, being a border fortress in the south of Peræa, and on the confines of the Nabatæi. There was a tradition that it was at this place that John the Baptist was beheaded. The city now bears the name of Mascra.</p><p><span id="note_28"><a href="#ref_28">28. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A Greek name, signifying the "Fine Stream." These were warm springs, situate on the eastern side of Jordan, to which Herod the Great resorted during his last illness, by the advice of his physicians. The valley of Callirhoë was visited by Captains Irby and Mangles in <date value="1818" authname="1818">1818</date>, and an interesting account of it is to be found in their 'Travels,' pp. 467–469. The waters are sulphureous to the taste.</p><p><span id="note_29"><a href="#ref_29">29. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Essenes, or Hessenes. These properly formed one of the great sects into which the Jews were divided in the time of Christ. They are not mentioned by name in the New Testament, but it has been conjectured that they are alluded to in Matt. xix. 12, and Col. ii. 18, 23. As stated here by Pliny, they generally lived at a distance from large towns, in communities which bore a great resemblance to the monkish societies of later times. They sent gifts to the Temple at Jerusalem, but never offered sacrifices there. They were divided into four classes, according to the time of their initiation. Their origin is uncertain. Some writers look upon them as the same as the Assidians, or Chasidim, mentioned in 1 Maccabees, ii. 42, vii. 13. Their principal society was probably the one mentioned by Pliny, and from this other smaller ones proceeded, and spread over Palestine, Syria, and Egypt. The Essenes of Egypt were divided into two sects; the <hi rend="ital">practical</hi> Essenes, whose mode of life was the same as those of Palestine; and the <hi rend="ital">contemplative</hi> Essenes, who were called <hi rend="ital">Therapeutœ.</hi> Both sects maintained the same doctrines; but the latter were distinguished by a more rigid mode of life. It has been suggested by Taylor, the editor of 'Calmet's Dictionary of the Bible,' that John the Baptist belonged to this sect.</p><p><span id="note_30"><a href="#ref_30">30. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or Engedi. Its ancient name was Hazezon-Tamar, when it was inhabited by the Amorites. See Gen. xiv. 7; 2 Chron. xx. 2. According to Josephus, it gave name to one of the fifteen toparchies of Judæa. It still retains its name, Ain-Jedey, or "Fountain of the Goats," and was so called from a spring which issued out of the limestone rock at the base of a lofty cliff.</p><p><span id="note_31"><a href="#ref_31">31. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Its site is now known as Sebbeh, on the south-west of the Dead Sea.</p></body>
