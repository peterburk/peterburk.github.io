Poisons are neutralized bytaking asses' milk; henbane more particularly, mistletoe, hemlock, the flesh of the sea-hare, opocarpathon,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> pharicon,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> anddorycnium:<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> the same, too, where coagulated milk<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> has beenproductive of bad effects, for the biestings,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> or first curdledmilk, should be reckoned as nothing short of a poison.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> Weshall have to mention many other uses to which asses' milk isapplied; but it should be remembered that in all cases it mustbe used fresh, or, if not, as new as possible, and warmed, forthere is nothing that more speedily loses its virtue. Thebones, too, of the ass are pounded and boiled, as an antidote tothe poison of the sea-hare. The wild ass<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> is possessed ofsimilar properties in every respect, but in a much higherdegree.</p><p>Of the wild horse<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> the Greek writers have made no mention,it not being a native of their country; we have every reason tobelieve, however, that it has the same properties as the animalin a tame state, but much more fully developed. Mares' milkeffectually neutralizes the venom of the sea-hare and allnarcotic poisons. Nor had the Greeks any knowledge fromexperience of the urns<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> and the bison,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> although in India theforests are filled with herds of wild oxen: it is only reasonable,<pb n="5333" />however, to conclude that all their medicinal properties mustbe much more highly developed than in the animal as foundamong us. It is asserted also, that cows' milk is a generalcounter-poison, in the cases above-mentioned, more particularly,as also where the poison of ephemeron<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> has settled internally,or cantharides have been administered; it acting upon thepoison by vomit. Broth, too, made from goats' flesh, neutral-izes the effects of cantharides, in a similar manner, it is said.To counteract the corrosive poisons which destroy by ulceration, veal or beef-suet is resorted to; and in cases where aleech has been swallowed, butter is the usual remedy, withvinegar heated with a red-hot iron. Indeed, butter employedby itself is a good remedy for poisons, for where oil is notto be procured, it is an excellent substitute for it. Used withhoney, butter heals injuries inflicted by millepedes. Thebroth of boiled tripe, it is thought, is an effectual repellent ofthe above-mentioned poisons, aconite and hemlock more particularly; veal-suet also has a similar repute.</p><p>Fresh goats' milk cheese is given to persons who have takenmistletoe, and goats' milk itself is a remedy for cantharides.Taken with Taminian<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> grapes, goats' milk is an antidote to theeffects of ephemeron. Goats' blood, boiled down with the marrow, is used as a remedy for the narcotic<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> poisons, and kids' bloodfor the other poisons. Kid's rennet is administered where per-sons have taken mistletoe, the juice of the white cham¾leon,<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>or bull's blood: for which last, hare's rennet in vinegar is alsoused by way of antidote. For injuries inflicted by the pastinaca,<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> and the stings or bites of all kinds of marine animals,hare's rennet, kid's rennet, or lamb's rennet is taken, in dosesof one drachma, in wine. Hare's rennet, too, generally formsan ingredient in the antidotes for poisons.</p><p>The moth that is seen fluttering about the flame of a lampis generally reckoned in the number of the noxious substances:its bad effects are neutralized by the agency of goat's liver.Goat's gall, too, is looked upon as an antidote to venomous<pb n="5334" />preparations from the field weazel.<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> But we will now returnto the other remedies, classified according to the various diseases.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is no longer reckoned among the poisons.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Juice of carpathum, a substance which does not appear to have beenidentified; but supposed by Bruce to have been a gum called <hi rend="ital">sassa</hi> , withwhich aloes are adulterated in Abyssinia, a thing that Galen tells us wasdone with the carpathum of the ancients.
