Near thesewaters is the stream of Hercules, which the former shun, toall appearance, and have thence obtained<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> the name of "VirginWaters." On instituting a comparison between the waters ofthese streams, the difference above-mentioned<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> may be immediately detected, the Virgin water being as much cooler tothe touch, as the Marcian water is in taste. And yet, for thislong time past, the pleasure of drinking these waters has beenlost to the City, owing to the ambition and avarice of certainpersons who have turned<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> them out of their course for thesupply of their country-seats and of various places in the suburbs,to the great detriment of the public health.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Aqua Virgo."
