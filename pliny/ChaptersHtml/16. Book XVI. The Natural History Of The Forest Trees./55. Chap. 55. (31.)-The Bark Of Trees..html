(31.)ÑTHE BARK OF TREES.</head><p>In some trees the bark<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> is thin, as in the laurel and thelime; in others, again, it is thick, as in the robur; in some it issmooth, as in the apple and the fig, while in the robur and thepalm it is rough: in all kinds it becomes more wrinkled whenthe tree is old. In some trees the bark bursts spontaneously,as in the vine for instance, while in others it falls off even, aswe see in the apple and the arbutus. In the cork-tree andthe poplar, the bark is substantial and fleshy; in the vine andthe reed it is membraneous. In the cherry it is similar tothe coats of the papyrus, while in the vine, the lime, and thefir, it is composed of numerous layers. In others, again, it issingle, the fig and the reed for instance.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is evident that he is speaking of the epidermis only, and not thecortical layers and the liber.</p></body>
