(13.)ÑASARUM, OR FOAL-FOOT.</head><p>The herb asarum,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> too, has the properties of nard, and,indeed, by some persons is known as wild nard. It has a leaf,<pb n="3122" />however, more like that of the ivy, only that it is rounder andsofter. The flower is purple, the root very similar to that ofthe Gallic nard, and the seed is like a grape. It is of a warmand vinous flavour, and blossoms twice a year, growing uponhill sides that are densely shaded. The best kind is that foundin Pontus, and the next best that of Phrygia; that of Illyricum being only of third-rate quality. The root is dug upwhen it is just beginning to put forth its leaves, and then driedin the sun. It very soon turns mouldy, and loses its properties.There has, also, been lately found a certain herb in some partsof Greece, the leaves of which do not differ in the slightestdegree from those of the Indian nard.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">FŽe remarks, that the name "baccara," in Greek, properly belongedto this plant, but that it was transferred by the Romans to the field nard,with which the Asarum had become confounded. It is the same as theAsarum Europ¾um of modern naturalists; but it does not, as Pliny asserts,flower twice in the year.</p></body>
