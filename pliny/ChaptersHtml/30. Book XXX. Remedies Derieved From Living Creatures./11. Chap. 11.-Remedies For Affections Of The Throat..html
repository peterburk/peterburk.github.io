Affections ofthe uvula and pains in the fauces are alleviated by using the dungof lambs before they have begun to graze, dried in the shade.Diseases of the uvula are cured with the juices of a snail piercedwith a needle; the snail, however, must be then hung up in thesmoke. The same maladies are treated also with ashes ofburnt swallows, mixed with honey; a preparation which isequally good for affections of the tonsillary glands. Sheep'smilk, used as a gargle, alleviates diseases of the fauces andtonsillary glands. Millepedes, bruised with pigeons' dung, aretaken as a gargle, with raisin wine; and they are applied, externally, with dried figs and nitre, for the purpose of soothingroughness of the fauces and catarrhs. For such cases, too,snails should be boiled unwashed, the earth only being removed, and then pounded and administered to the patient inraisin wine. Some persons are of opinion that for these pur-<pb n="5434" />poses the snails of Astypalæa<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> are the most efficacious, andthey give the preference to the detersive preparation<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> madefrom them. The parts affected are sometimes rubbed witha cricket, and affections of the tonsillary glands are alleviatedby being rubbed with the hands of a person who has bruised acricket.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. iv. c. 23, B. viii. c. 59, and cc. 15 and 43 of the present Book.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Smegma."</p></body>
