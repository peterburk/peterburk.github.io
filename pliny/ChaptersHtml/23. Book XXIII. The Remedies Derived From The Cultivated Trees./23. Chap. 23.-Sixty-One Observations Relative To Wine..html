Those,on the other hand, who wish to reduce themselves, or preventthe bowels from being relaxed, should abstain from drinkingwhile taking their meals, and drink but a very little onlywhen they have done eating. To drink wine fasting is afashion of recent introduction<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> only, and an extremely badone for persons engaged in matters of importance, and requiring a continued application of the mental faculties. Wine, nodoubt, was taken fasting in ancient times, but then it was asa preparative for sleep and repose from worldly cares; and itis for this reason that, in Homer,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> we find Helen presentingit to the guests before the repast. It is upon this fact, too,that the common proverb is founded, which says that "wisdom is obscured by wine."<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> It is to wine that we men areindebted for being the only animated beings that drink withoutbeing thirsty. When drinking wine, it is a very good plan totake a draught of water every now and then; and to take onelong draught of it at the last, cold water taken internallyhaving the effect of instantaneously dispelling inebriation.<pb n="4474" /></p><p>It is strongly recommended by Hesiod<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> to drink undilutedwine<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> for twenty days before the rising of the Dog-star, andas many after. Pure wine, too, acts as an antidote to hemlock, coriander,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> henbane, mistletoe, opium, mercury, as alsoto stings inflicted by bees, wasps, hornets, the phalangium,serpents, and scorpions; all kinds of poison, in fact, which areof a cold nature, the venom of the hæmorrhois and theprester,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> in particular, and the noxious effects of fungi. Undiluted wine is good, too, in cases of flatulency, gnawing painsin the thoracic organs, excessive vomitings at the stomach,fluxes of the bowels and intestines, dysentery, excessive perspirations after prolonged fits of coughing, and defluxions ofvarious kinds. In the cardiac<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> disease, it is a good plan toapply a sponge soaked in neat wine to the left breast: in allthese cases, however, old white wine is the best. A fomentation of hot wine applied to the genitals of beasts of burden isfound to be very beneficial; and, introduced into the mouth,with the aid of a horn, it has the effect of removing all sensations of fatigue.<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> It is asserted that in apes, and other quadrupeds with toes, the growth will be impeded if they areaccustomed to drink undiluted wine.<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In the time of the Emperor Tiberius.
