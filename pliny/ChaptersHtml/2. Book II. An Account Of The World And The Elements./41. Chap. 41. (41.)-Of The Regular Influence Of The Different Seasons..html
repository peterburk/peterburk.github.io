<div2 type="chapter" n="41" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 41. (41.)—OF THE REGULAR INFLUENCE OF THE DIFFERENT SEASONS.</head><p>There is moreover a peculiar influence in the differentdegrees of certain signs, as in the autumnal equinox, andalso in the winter solstice, when we find that a particularstar is connected with the state of the weather<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>. It is notso much the recurrence of showers and storms, as of variouscircumstances, which act both upon animals and vegetables.Some are planet-struck<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>, and others, at stated times, are affectedin the bowels, the sinews, the head, or the intellect.<pb n="1068" />The olive, the white poplar, and the willow turn their leavesround at the summer solstice. The herb pulegium, whendried and hanging up in a house, blossoms on the very dayof the winter solstice, and bladders burst in consequence oftheir being distended with air<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>. One might wonder at this,did we not observe every day, that the plant named heliotrope alwayslooks towards the setting sun, and is, at allhours, turned towards him, even when he is obscured byclouds<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>. It is certain that the bodies of oysters and ofwhelks<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>, and of shell-fish generally, are increased in size andagain diminished by the influence of the moon. Certainaccurate observers have found out, that the entrails of thefield-mouse<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> correspond in number to the moon's age, andthat the very small animal, the ant, feels the power of thisluminary, always resting from her labours at the change ofthe moon. And so much the more disgraceful is our ignorance, as every one acknowledges that the diseases in theeyes of certain beasts of burden increase and diminish according to the age of the moon. But the immensity of theheavens, divided as they are into seventy-two<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> constellations,may serve as an excuse. These are the resemblances of certain things, animate and inanimate, into which the learnedhave divided the heavens. In these they have announced1600 stars, as being remarkable either for their effects ortheir appearance; for example, in the tail of the Bull thereare seven stars, which are named Vergiliæ<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>; in his forehead<pb n="1069" />are the Suculæ; there is also Bootes, which follows the sevennorthern stars<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"cum tempestatibus confici sidus intelligimus."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"afflantur." On this term Hardouin remarks, "Siderantur.Sideratio morbi genus est, partem aliquam corporis, ipsumque ssepetotum corpus percutientis subito: quod quum repentino eveniat impetu, e cœlovi quadam sideris evenire putatur." Lemaire, i. 317.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cicero alludes to these opinions in his treatise De Divin. ii. 33; seealso Aul.
