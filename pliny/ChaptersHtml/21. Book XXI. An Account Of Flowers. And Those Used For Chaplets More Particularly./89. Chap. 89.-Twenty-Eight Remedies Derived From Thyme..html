There are two kinds of thyme: the white thymewith a ligneous root, which grows upon declivities, and is themost esteemed of the two, and another variety, which is of adarker colour, and bears a swarthy flower. They are, both ofthem, considered to be extremely beneficial to the sight, whether used as an article of food or as a medicament, and to begood for inveterate coughs. Used as an electuary, with vinegar and salt, they facilitate expectoration, and taken withhoney, they prevent the blood from coagulating. Applied ex-<pb n="4376" />ternally with mustard, they dispel chronic fluxes of the fauces,as well as various affections of the stomach and bowels. Still,however, these plants must be used in moderation, as they areof a heating nature, for which reason it is that they act soastringently upon the bowels. In cases of ulceration of theintestines, the dose should be one denarius of thyme to onesextarius of oxymel; the same proportions, too, should be takenfor pains in the sides, between the shoulder-blades, or in thethoracic organs. Taken with oxymel, these plants are used forthe cure of intestinal diseases, and a similar draught is administered in cases of alienation of the senses and melancholy.</p><p>Thyme is given also for epilepsy, when the fits come on, thesmell of it reviving the patient; it is said, too, that epilepticpersons should sleep upon soft thyme. It is good, also, forhardness of breathing, and for asthma and obstructions of thecatamenia. A decoction of thyme in water, boiled down toone-third, brings away the dead fœtus, and it is given to maleswith oxymel, as a remedy for flatulency, and in cases of swelling of the abdomen or testes and of pains in the bladder. Applied with wine, it removes tumours and fluxes, and, in combination with vinegar, callosities and warts. Mixed with wine,it is used as an external application for sciatica; and, beatenup with oil and sprinkled upon wool, it is employed for diseasesof the joints, and for sprains. It is applied, also, to burns,mixed with hogs' lard. For maladies of the joints of recentdate, thyme is administered in drink, in doses of three oboli tothree cyathi of oxymel. For loss of appetite, it is given, beatenup with salt.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See c. 31 of this Book.
