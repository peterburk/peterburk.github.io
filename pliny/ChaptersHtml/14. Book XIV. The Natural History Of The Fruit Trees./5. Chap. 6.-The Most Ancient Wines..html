<div2 type="chapter" n="6" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 6.—THE MOST ANCIENT WINES.</head><p>The wine of Maronea,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> on the coast of Thrace, appears tohave been the most celebrated in ancient times, as we learnfrom the writings of Homer. I dismiss, however, all the fabulous stories and various traditions which we find relative toits origin, except, indeed, the one which states that Aristæus,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> anative of the same country, was the first person that mixedhoney<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> with wine, natural productions, both of them, of thehighest degree of excellence. Homer<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> has stated that theMaronean wine was mixed with water in the proportion oftwenty measures of water to one of wine. The wine that isstill produced in the same district retains all its formerstrength, and a degree of vigour that is quite insuperable.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>Mucianus, who thrice held the consulship, and one of ourmost recent authors, when in that part of the world waswitness himself to the fact, that with one sextarius of thisWine it was the custom to mix no less than eighty sextarii of<pb n="3237" />water: he states, also, that this wine is black,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> has a strongbouquet, and is all the richer for being old.</p><p>The Pramnian wine, too, which Homer<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> has also similarlyeulogized, still retains its ancient fame: it is grown in theterritory of Smyrna, in the vicinity of the shrine of theMother<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> of the Gods.</p><p>Among the other wines now known, we do not find anythat enjoyed a high reputation in ancient times. In theyear of the consulship of L. Opimius, when C. Gracchus,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> thetribune of the people, engaging in sedition, was slain, thegrowth of every wine was of the very highest quality. Inthat year, the weather was remarkable for its sereneness, andthe ripening of the grape, the "coctura,"<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> as they call it,was fully effected by the heat of the sun. This was in theyear of the City 633. There are wines still preserved of thisyear's growth, nearly two hundred years ago; they haveassumed the consistency of honey, with a rough taste; forsuch, in fact, is the nature of wines, that, when extremelyold, it is impossible to drink them in a pure state; and theyrequire to be mixed with water, as long keeping renders themintolerably bitter.<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> A very small quantity of the Opimianwine, mixed with them, will suffice for the seasoning of otherwines. Let us suppose, according to the estimated value ofthese wines in those days, that the original price of them wasone hundred sesterces per amphora: if we add to this six per-cent. per annum, a legal and moderate interest, we shallthen be able to ascertain what was the exact price of thetwelfth part of an amphora at the beginning of the reign ofCaius Cæsar, the son of Germanicus, one hundred and sixtyyears after that consulship. In relation to this fact, we havea remarkable instance,<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> when we call to mind the life of Pom-<pb n="3238" />ponius Secundus, the poet, and the banquet which he gaveto that prince<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>—so enormous is the capital that lies buried inour cellars of wine! Indeed, there is no one thing, the valueof which more sensibly increases up to the twentieth year, orwhich decreases with greater rapidity after that period, supposing that the value of it is not by that time greatly enhanced.<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> Very rarely, indeed, up to the present day, has itbeen known for a single<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> piece of wine to cost a thousandsesterces, except, indeed, when such a sum may have been paidin a fit of extravagance and debauchery. The people ofVienne, it is said, are the only ones who have set a higher pricethan this upon their "picata," wines, the various kinds ofwhich we have already mentioned;<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> and this, it is thought,they only do, vying with each other, and influenced by a sortof national self-esteem. This wine, drunk in a cool state, isgenerally thought to be of a colder<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> temperature than anyother.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Said to have been so called from Maron, a king of Thrace, who dweltin the vicinity of the Thracian Ismarus.
