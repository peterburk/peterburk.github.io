(105.)—OF NAPHTHA.</head><p>Naphtha is a substance of a similar nature<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> (it is so calledabout Babylon, and in the territory of the Astaceni, inParthia<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>), flowing like liquid bitumen. It has a great affinity to fire, whichinstantly darts on it wherever it is seen<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>.It is said, that in this way it was that Medea burned Jason's mistress; hercrown having taken fire, when she approached the altar for the purpose ofsacrificing<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The substance here mentionedmay be considered as not differingessentially from the Maltha of the last chapter, except in being of a morefluid consistence.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Astaceni are supposed to have inhabited a district near thesources of the Indus, probably corresponding to the modern Cabul.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We may conceive of a quantity ofinflammable vapour on the surfaceof the naphtha, which might, in some degree, produce the effect heredescribed.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Horace, in one of his Epodes, where he refers to the magicalarts ofMedea, says, that it was a cloak, "palla," which was sent to Creüsa;v. 65. So far as there is any foundation for the story, we may supposethat some part of her dress had been impregnated with an inflammablesubstance, which took fire when she approached the blazing altar.</p></body>
