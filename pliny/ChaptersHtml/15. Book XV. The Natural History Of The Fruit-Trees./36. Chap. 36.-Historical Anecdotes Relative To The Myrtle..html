There were myrtles growing on the site now occupied by Rome, at the time of its foundation; for a traditionexists to the effect that the Romans and the Sabines, afterthey had intended fighting, on account of the virgins who hadbeen ravished by the former, purified themselves, first layingdown their arms, with sprigs of myrtle, on the very same spotwhich is now occupied by the statues of Venus Cluacina; forin the ancient language "cluere" means to purify.</p><p>This tree is employed, too, for a species of fumigation;<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> beingselected for that purpose, because Venus, who presides over allunions, is the tutelary divinity of the tree.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> I am not quitesure, too, whether this tree was not the very first that wasplanted in the public places of Rome, the result of some ominous presage by the augurs of wondrous import. For at theTemple of Quirinus, or, in other words, of Romulus himself,one of the most ancient in Rome, there were formerly twomyrtle-trees, which grew for a long period just in front ofthe temple; one of these was called the Patrician tree, theother the Plebeian. The Patrician myrtle was for many yearsthe superior tree, full of sap and vigour; indeed, so long as theSenate maintained its superiority, so did the tree, being oflarge growth, while the Plebeian tree presented a meagre,shrivelled appearance. In later times, however, the latter treegained the superiority, and the Patrician myrtle began to failjust at the period of the<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> Marsic War,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> when the power ofthe Senate was so greatly weakened: and little by little didthis once majestic tree sink into a state of utter exhaustionand sterility. There was an ancient altar<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> also, consecrated'<pb n="3330" />to Venus Myrtea, known at the present day by the name ofMurcia.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He means the Acroceraunian chain in Epirus, mentioned in B. iii.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. iii. c. 9.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He was one of the companions of Ulysses, fabled by Homer and Ovidto have been transformed by Circe into a swine.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot"><foreign lang="greek">Mursi)nh,</foreign> was its Greek name.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxv. c. 59.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xii. c. 2.
