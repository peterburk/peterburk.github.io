<div2 type="chapter" n="22" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 22. (8.)—FABRICS WHICH RIVAL THE COLOURS OF FLOWERS.</head><p>We have now said enough on the subject of the odoriferousflowers; in relation to which, luxury not only glories in havingvanquished Nature in the composition of unguents, but haseven gone so far as to challenge, in her fabrics, those flowerswhich are more particularly recommended by the beauty oftheir tints. I remark that the following are the three principal<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> colours; the red, that of the kermes<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> for instance, which,beginning in the tints of the rose, reflects, when viewed<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> sideways and held up to the light, the shades that are found in theTyrian purple,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and the colours of the dibapha<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> and Laconiancloths: the amethystine colour, which is borrowed from theviolet, and to which, bordering as it does on the purple, wehave given the name of "ianthinum"<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>—it must, however, beremembered, that we here give a general name to a colourwhich is subdivided into numerous tints<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>—and a third, properlyknown as the "conchyliated" colour, but which comprehends<pb n="4327" />a variety of shades, such, for instance, as the tints of the heliotropium, and others of a deeper colour, the hues of the mallow,inclining to a full purple, and the colours of the late<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> violet;this last being the most vivid, in fact, of all the conchyliatedtints. The rival colours being now set side by side, Natureand luxury may enter the lists, to vie for the mastery.</p><p>I find it stated that, in the most ancient times, yellow washeld in the highest esteem, but was reserved exclusively forthe nuptial veils<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> of females; for which reason it is perhapsthat we do not find it included among the principal colours,those being used in common by males and females: indeed, itis the circumstance of their being used by both sexes in common that gives them their rank as principal colours.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Principales." The meaning of this term is explained at the end ofthis Chapter. Red, yellow, and blue—or else, red, green, and violet, areprobably the <hi rend="ital">primary</hi> colours of light.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. ix. c. 65, and B. xvi. c. 12.
