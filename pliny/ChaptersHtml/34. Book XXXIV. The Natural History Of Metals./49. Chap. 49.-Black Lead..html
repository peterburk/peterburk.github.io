<div2 type="chapter" n="49" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 49.—BLACK LEAD.</head><p>Black lead<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> is used in the form of pipes and sheets: it is extractedwith great labour in Spain, and throughout all the Gallicprovinces; but in Britannia<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> it is found in the upper stratum ofthe earth, in such abundance, that a law has been spontaneouslymade, prohibiting any one from working more than a certainquantity of it. The various kinds of black lead are known bythe following names—the Ovetanian,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> the Caprariensian,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span><pb n="6216" />and the Oleastrensian.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> There is no difference whatever inthem, when the scoria has been carefully removed by calcination.It is a marvellous fact, that these mines, and these only,when they have been abandoned for some time, become replenished,and are more prolific than before. This wouldappear to be effected by the air, infusing itself at libertythrough the open orifices, just as some women become moreprolific after abortion. This was lately found to be the casewith the Santarensian mine in Bætica;<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> which, after beingfarmed at an annual rental of two hundred thousand denarii,and then abandoned, is now rented at two hundred and fifty-five thousand per annum. In the same manner, the Antonianmine in the same province has had the rent raised to fourhundred thousand sesterces per annum.</p><p>It is a remarkable fact, that if we pour water into a vesselof lead, it will not melt; but that if we throw into the watera pebble or a copper quadrans,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> the vessel will be penetratedby the fire.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The "lead" of the moderns.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Mr. T.
