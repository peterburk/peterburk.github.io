Theleaves, too, are said to be useful for the gums, when swollenwith sanious blood, or if there are discharges of blood there-from. The seed, too, of plantago is a cure for abscesses in thegums, and for gum-boils. Aristolochia has a strengtheningeffect upon the gums and teeth; and the same with vervain,either chewed with the root of that plant, or boiled in wineand vinegar, the decoction being employed as a gargle. Thesame is the case, also, with root of cinquefoil, boiled down toone third, in wine or vinegar; before it is boiled, however, theroot should be washed in sea or salt water: the decoction, too,must be kept a considerable time in the mouth. Some personsprefer cleaning the teeth with ashes of cinquefoil.</p><p>Root of verbascum<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> is also boiled in wine, and the decoctionused for rinsing the teeth. The same is done too with hyssopand juice of peucedanum, mixed with opium; or else the juiceof the root of anagallis,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> the female plant in particular, isinjected into the nostril on the opposite side to that in whichthe pain is felt.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See c. 11 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See c. 28 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See c. 73 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See c. 92 of this Book.</p></body>
