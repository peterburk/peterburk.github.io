<div2 type="chapter" n="71" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 71.—FISHES WHICH ARE ENCLOSED IN A STONY SHELL — SEA ANIMALS WHICH HAVE NO SENSATION — OTHER ANIMALS WHICH LIVE IN THE MUD.</head><p>Those animals, however, it must be admitted, which lie enclosed in a stony shell, have no sensation whatever—such asthe oyster,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> for instance. Many, again, have the same natureas vegetables; such as the holothuria,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> the pulmones,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> andthe sea-stars.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> Indeed, I may say that there is no land produc-<pb n="2459" />tion which has not its like in the sea;<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> no, not even those insectswhich frequent our public-houses<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> in summer, and are so trouble-some with their nimble leaps, nor yet those which more especially make the human hair their place of refuge; for theseare often drawn up in a mass<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> collected around the bait. This,too, is supposed to be the reason why the sleep of fish is sometimes so troubled in the night. Upon some fish, indeed, theseanimals breed<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> as parasites: among these, we find the fishknown as the chalcis.<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is singular that Pliny, after his numerous stories as to the sensitiveness of numerous bivalves, should make this statement in referenceto the oyster; for, on the contrary, as Cuvier says, the oyster, in commonwith the other bivalves, is extremely sensitive to the touch.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier says, that the different zoöphytes, the sea-star, at least, arefar from having the life of vegetables only; for that they are real animals,which have the sense of touch, a voluntary power of motion more or lesscomplete, and seize and devour their prey. It is not, however, very wellknown, he says, what was the "holothurium" of the ancients. Aristotle,Hist. Anim. B. i. c. 1, ranks it, as well as the oyster, among the animalswhich, without being attached to any object, have not the faculty ofmoving; and in his work, De Part. Anim. B. iv. c. 5, he adds, that theholothurium and the pulmo only differ from the sponge in being detached.Cuvier is of opinion, however, that they both belong to the halcyones, theround kinds of which easily detach themselves from the places upon whichthey have grown.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pulmo, "the sea-lungs."</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or, as we call it, the star-fish.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Adeoque nihil non gignitur in mari."</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Cauponarum." "Caupona" had two significations; that of an innwhere travellers obtained food and lodging, and that of a shop where wineand ready-dressed meat were sold. A lower kind of inn was the popina,which was principally frequented by the slaves and lower classes, and wasmostly used as a brothel as well.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He alludes to various kinds of sea-animals, called sea-lice and seafleas. Cuvier says, that there are some crustacea which have been calledsea-fleas and sea-lice, some of which kinds are parasites, and are attachedto various fishes and cetacea. Thus, he says, a pycnogonum is commonlynamed "pediculus balænæ," or the "whale-louse;" one of the calygæ iscalled the "fish-flea," another the "mackerel-flea." The name of sea-flea,he observes, has been given more especially to a very diminutive kind ofshrimp, in consequence of its power of leaping from place to place.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle says, that the chalcis is greatly tormented by sea-fleas, whichattach themselves to its gills. Cuvier remarks, that a great number offish are subject to have the gills attacked by parasitical animals of thegenus Lernæa or that of the monoculi of Linnæus, which have been dividedinto many classes since. They have nothing in common, he says, with theland-flea, except the name and the property of living at the expense ofother animals.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The ancients, Cuvier says, speak of their chalcis as being of a similarnature to the thryssa and the sardine (Athenæus, B. vii.), gregarious fishes,which live both in the sea and in fresh water, and the flesh of which wassalted. Hence he concludes that it was the same as the Clupea ficta ofLacepède, the "finte" of the French, and the agone of Lombardy,which unites all these characteristics, and is sometimes called the "sardine" of the Lago di Garda.</p></body>
