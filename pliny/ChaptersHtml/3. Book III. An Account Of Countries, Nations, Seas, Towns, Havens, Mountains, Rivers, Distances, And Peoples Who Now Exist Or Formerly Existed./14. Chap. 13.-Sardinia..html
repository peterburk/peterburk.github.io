<div2 type="chapter" n="13" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 13.—SARDINIA.</head><p>Leucothea comes next, and after it, but out of sight, as itlies upon the verge of the African Sea, Sardinia. It is situatesomewhat less<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> than eight miles from the nearest point ofCorsica, and the Straits between them are even still morereduced by the small islands there situate, called the Cuniculariæ<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>, as also those of Phintonis<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and Fossæ, fromwhich last the Straits themselves have obtained the name ofTaphros<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>.</p><p>(7.) Sardinia extends, upon the east side, a distance of188 miles, on the west 175, on the south 77, and on thenorth 125, being 565 miles in circumference. Its promontory of Caralis<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> is distant from Africa 200, and fromGades 1400 miles. Off the promontory of Gordis<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> it hastwo islands called the Isles of Hercules<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>, off that of Sulcis,the island of Enosis<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>, and off that of Caralis, Ficaria<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>. Somewriters place Beleris not far from it, as also Callodis, and theisland known as Heras Lutra<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>.</p><p>The most celebrated peoples of this island are the Ilienses<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>,the Balari, and the Corsi; and among its eighteen towns,there are those of the Sulcitani<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>, the Valentini<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>, the Neapoli-<pb n="1216" />tani<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>, the Bosenses<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>, the Caralitani<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span>, who enjoy the rights ofRoman citizens, and the Norenses<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span>. There is also one colonywhich is called Ad Turrim Libysonis<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span>. Timæus has calledthis island Sandaliotis, on account of the similarity of its shapeto the sole of a shoe, while Myrtilus has given it the name ofIchnusa<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span>, from its resemblance to the print of a footstep.Opposite to the Gulf of Pæstum is Leucasia<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span>, so called froma Siren who is buried there; opposite to Velia are Poiitiaand Isacia, both known by one name, that of Œnotrides, aproof that Italy was formerly possessed by the Œnotrians.Opposite to Vibo are the little islands called Ithacesiæ<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span>from the watch-tower of Ulysses situate there.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The distance between is hardly five miles.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">These rocks appear at the present day to be nameless.
