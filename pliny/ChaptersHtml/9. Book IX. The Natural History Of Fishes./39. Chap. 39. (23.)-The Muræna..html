(23.)ÑTHE MUR®NA.</head><p>The mur¾na brings forth every month, while all the other<pb n="2410" />fishes spawn only at stated periods: the eggs of this fishincrease with the greatest rapidity.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> It is a vulgar<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> beliefthat the mur¾na comes on shore, and is there impregnatedby intercourse with serpents. Aristotle<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> calls the male,which impregnates the female, by the name of "zmyrus;"and says that there is a difference between them, the mur¾nabeing spotted<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and weakly, while the zmyrus is all of onecolour and hardy, and has teeth which project beyond themouth. In northern Gaul all the mur¾n¾ have on theright jaw seven spots,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> which bear a resemblance to the constellation of the Septentriones,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> and are of a gold colour,shining as long as the animal is alive, but disappearing as soonas it is dead. Vedius Pollio,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> a Roman of equestrian rank,and one of the friends of the late Emperor Augustus, found amethod of exercising his cruelty by means of this animal, forhe caused such slaves as had been condemned by him, to bethrown into preserves filled with mur¾n¾; not that the land<pb n="2411" />animals would not have fully sufficed for this purpose, butbecause he could not see a man so aptly torn to pieces all atonce by any other kind of animal. It is said that these fishare driven to madness by the taste of vinegar. Their skin isexceedingly thin; while that of the eel, on the other hand, ismuch thicker. Verrius informs us that formerly the childrenof the Roman citizens, while wearing the pr¾texta,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> wereflogged with eel-skins, and that, for this reason, no pecuniarypenalty<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> could by law be inflicted upon them.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hardouin says, that though this assertion is repeated by Pliny inc. 74 of the present Book, it is a mistake; we learn, however, fromAristotle, Hist. Anim. B. v. c. 11, and Athen¾us, B. vii., that the youngof the mur¾na are remarkable for the quickness of their growth.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This vulgar belief is, however, followed by Oppian, Halieut. B. i.c. 555; Athen¾us, B. vii.; ®lian, Hist. Anim. B. i. c. 50, and B. ix. c. 66;and Nicander, Theriac., who, however, adds, "if indeed it is the truth." Itis also alluded to by Basil, in Hexaem. Homil. vii., and Ambrose, Homil.v. c. 7.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. V. C 11, only quotes this story as he hadheard it, and does not vouch for its truth. Doro, as quoted by Athen¾us,B. vii., makes the zmyrus and the mur¾na to be of totally different genera.The zmyrus, he says, is without bone, the whole of it is eatable, and it isremarkable for the tenderness of the flesh. There are two kinds, of whichthe best, he says, are those which are black.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The common mur¾na, Cuvier says, is spotted with brown andyellow, but there is a larger kind, with stronger teeth and brown all over,the Mur¾na Christini, of Risso. This, he has no doubt, is the zmyrus ofthe ancients. Modern naturalists, he says, have incorrectly called Mur¾nazmyrus, a small kind of conger, which has yellow spots upon the neck.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier has already made some remarks on this passage in one of hisNotes to c. 24 of the present Book. See p. 395.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Seven Terriones, or plough oxen. The constellation of UrsaMajor was thus called by the Romans.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This wretched man was originally a freedman, and though he was onone occasion punished by Augustus for his cruelty, he left him a great partof his property. He died B. C. 15. He is supposed to be the same personas the one against whom Augustus wrote some Fescennine verses, mentioned by Macrobius, Sat. B. ii. c. 4.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Until the Roman youth assumed the toga virilis, they wore the togapr¾texta, or senatorial gown. The toga virilis was assumed at the Liberalia, in the month of March; and though no age appears to have beenpositively fixed for the ceremony, it probably took place, as a general rule,on the feast which next followed the completion of the fourteenth year;though it is not certain that the completion of the fourteenth year was notalways the time observed. So long as a male wore the pr¾texta, he wasconsidered "impubes," and when he had assumed the toga virilis, he was"pubes." Hence the word "investis," or "pr¾textatus," (here employed),was the same as impubes.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Thus the "impubes" paid, as Hardouin says, "not in money, but inskin." Isidorus, in his Glossary, says, "'Anguilla' is the name given tothe ordinary 'scutica,' or whip with which boys are chastised at school."The witty Rabelais says, B. ii. c. 30, "Whereupon his master gave himsuch a sound lashing with an eel-skin, that his own would have been worthnothing to make bag-pipe bags of."</p></body>
