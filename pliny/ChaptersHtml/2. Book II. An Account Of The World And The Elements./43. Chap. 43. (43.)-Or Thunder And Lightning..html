(43.)—OR THUNDER AND LIGHTNING.</head><p>It cannot therefore be denied, that fire proceeding fromthe stars which are above the clouds, may fall on them, aswe frequently observe on serene evenings, and that the air isagitated by the impulse, as darts when they are hurled whizthrough the air. And when it arrives at the cloud, a discordant kind of vapour is produced, as when hot iron isplunged into water, and a wreath of smoke is evolved. Hencearise squalls. And if wind or vapour be struggling in thecloud, thunder is discharged; if it bursts out with a flame,there is a thunderbolt; if it be long in forcing out its way,it is simply a flash of lightning<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>. By the latter the cloud issimply rent, by the former it is shattered. Thunder is pro-<pb n="1070" />duced by the stroke given to the condensed air, and henceit is that the fire darts from the chinks of the clouds. It ispossible also that the vapour, which has risen from the earth,being repelled by the stars, may produce thunder, when it ispent up in a cloud; nature restraining the sound whilst thevapour is struggling to escape, but when it does escape, thesound bursting forth, as is the case with bladders that aredistended with air. It is possible also that the spirit, whatever itbe, may be kindled by friction, when it is so violentlyprojected. It is possible that, by the dashing of the twoclouds, the lightning may flash out, as is the case when twostones are struck against each other. But all these thingsappear to be casual. Hence there are thunderbolts whichproduce no effect, and proceed from no immediate actualcause; by these mountains and seas are struck, and no injury is done. Those which prognosticate future events proceed from on high and from stated causes, and they comefrom their peculiar stars<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The words in the original are respectively <hi rend="ital">fulmen</hi> and<hi rend="ital">fulgetrum;</hi>Seneca makes a similar distinction between <hi rend="ital">fulmen</hi> and <hi rend="ital">fulguratio:</hi> "Fulguratio est late ignis explicitus; fulmen est coactus ignis ot impetujactus."
