<div2 type="chapter" n="2" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 2. (2.)ÑACONITE, OTHERWISE CALLED THELYPHONON, CAM-MARON, PARDALIANCHES, OR SCORPIO; FOUR REMEDIES.</head><p>But who, I say, can sufficiently venerate the zeal and spirit ofresearch displayed by the ancients? It is they who have shownus that aconite is the most prompt of all poisons in its effectsÑso much so indeed, that female animals, if the sexual parts<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>are but touched with it, will not survive a single day. Withthis poison it was that M. C¾cilius<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> accused Calpurnius Bestiaof killing his wives in their sleep, and this it was that gaverise to that fearful peroration of his, denouncing the murderousfinger of the accused.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> According to the fables of mythology,this plant was originally produced from the foam of the dogCerberus, when dragged by Hercules from the Infernal<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> Regions; for which reason, it is said, it is still so remarkablyabundant in the vicinity of Heraclea in Pontus, a spot wherethe entrance is still pointed out to the shades below.</p><p>And yet, noxious as it is, the ancients have shown us how toemploy aconite for the benefit of mankind, and have taught usas the result of their experience, that, taken in mulled wine,it neutralizes the venom of the scorpion: indeed such is thenature of this deadly plant, that it kills man, unless it can find<pb n="5219" />in man something else to kill. When such is the case, asthough it had discovered in the body a fit rival to contend with,that substance is the sole object of its attack; finding anotherpoison in the viscera, to it alone it confines its onslaught;and thus, a truly marvellous thing! two poisons, each of themof a deadly nature, destroy one another within the body, andthe man survives. Even more than this, the ancients havehanded down to us remedies employed by the animals themselves, and have shown how that venomous creatures even effecttheir own cure. By the contact of aconite the scorpion isstruck with torpor,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> is quite benumbed, assumes a pallid hue,and so confesses itself vanquished. When this is the case,white hellebore is its great auxiliary: the very touch of it dispels its torpor, and the aconite is forced to yield before twofoes, its own enemy<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> and the common<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> enemy of all.</p><p>Now, after this, if any one should be of opinion that mancould, by any chance or possibility, make such discoveries asthese, he must surely be guilty of ingratitude in thus appre-ciating the beneficence of the gods! In countries frequentedby the panther, they rub meat with aconite, and if one ofthose animals should but taste it, its effects are fatal: indeedwere not these means adopted, the country would soon be overrun by them. It is for this reason, too, that some personshave given to hellebore the name of "pardalianches."<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> It hasbeen well ascertained, however, that the panther instantaneouslyrecovers if it can find the opportunity of eating human ordure.<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>So far as these animals are concerned, who can entertain adoubt that it was chance only that first led them to this discovery; and that as often as this happens the discovery is onlya mere repetition of the accident, there being neither reasonnor an appreciation of experience to ensure its transmissionamong them?</p><p>(3.) It is chance,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> yes, it is chance that is the Deity whohas made to us these numerous revelations for our practical<pb n="5220" />benefit;<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> always understanding that under this name we meanNature, that great parent and mistress of all things: and thisis evident, whether we come to the conclusion, that these wildbeasts make the discovery from day to day, or that they aregifted from the first with these powers of perception. Regarded in another point of view, it really is a disgrace thatall animated beings should have an exact knowledge of whatis beneficial to them, with the exception of man!</p><p>The ancients, openly professing their belief that there is noevil without some admixture of good, have asserted that aconiteis a remarkably useful ingredient in compositions for the eyes.It may therefore be permitted me, though I have hithertoomitted a description of the poisonous plants, to point out thecharacteristics of aconite, if only that it may be the moreeasily detected. Aconite<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> has leaves like those of cyclaminos<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>or of the cucumber, never more than four in number, slightlyhairy, and rising from near the root. This root, which is ofmoderate size, resembles the sea-fish known as the "cammarus,"<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> a circumstance owing to which the plant has receivedthe name of "cammaron" from some; while others, for thereason already<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> mentioned, have called it "thelyphonon."<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span>The root is slightly curved, like a scorpion's tail, for whichreason some persons have given it the name of "scorpio."Others, again, have preferred giving it the name of "myoctonon,"<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> from the fact that the odour of it kills mice at aconsiderable distance even.</p><p>This plant is found growing upon the naked rocks knownas "aeon¾;"<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> and hence it is, according to some authorities,<pb n="5221" />that it is called "aconitum," there being not so much as dusteven about it to conduce to its nutriment. Such is the reasongiven for its name by some: but according to others, it receives this appellation from the fact that it fatally exercises thesame effects upon the body that the whetstone<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> does upon theedge of iron, being no sooner employed than its effects are felt.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxv. c. 75.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Properly "C¾lius "Ñthe same M.
