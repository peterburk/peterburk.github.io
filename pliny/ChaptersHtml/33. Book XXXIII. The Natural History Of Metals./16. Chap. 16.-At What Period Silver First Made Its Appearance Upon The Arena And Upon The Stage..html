C¾sar, who was afterwards dictator, butat that time ¾dile, was the first person, on the occasion of thefuneral games in honour of his father, to employ all the apparatusof the arena<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> in silver; and it was on the same occasionthat for the first time criminals encountered wild beastswith implements of silver, a practice imitated at the presentday in our municipal towns even.</p><p>At the games celebrated by C. Antonius the stage was madeof<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> silver; and the same was the case at those celebratedby L. Mur¾na. The Emperor Caius had a scaffold<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> introducedinto the Circus, upon which there were one hundred andtwenty-four thousand pounds' weight of silver. His successorClaudius, on the occasion of his triumph over Britain, announcedby the inscriptions that among the coronets of gold,there was one weighing seven thousand<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> pounds' weight, contributedby Nearer Spain, and another of nine thousand pounds,<pb n="6095" />presented by Gallia Comata.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> Nero, who succeeded him, coveredthe Theatre of Pompeius with gold for one day,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> the occasion onwhich he displayed it to Tiridates, king of Armenia. Andyet how small was this theatre in comparison with that GoldenPalace<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> of his, with which he environed our city.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Of the amphitheatre.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Covered, probably, with plates of silver.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Pegma."
