<div2 type="chapter" n="19" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 19. (17.)—THE NATIONS OF SCYTHIA AND THE COUNTRIES ON THE EASTERN OCEAN.</head><p>Beyond this river are the peoples of Scythia. The Persianshave called them by the general name of Sacæ,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> which properly<pb n="2034" />belongs to only the nearest nation of them. The more ancientwriters give them the name of Aramii. The Scythians themselves give the name of "Chorsari" to the Persians, and they callMount Caucasus Graucasis, which means "white with snow."The multitude of these Scythian nations is quite innumerable:in their life and habits they much resemble the people of Parthia.The tribes among them that are better known are the Sacæ, theMassagetæ,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> the Dahæ,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> the Essedones,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> the Ariacæ,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> theRhymmici, the Pæsici, the Amardi,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> the Histi, the Edones, theCame, the Camacæ, the Euchatæ,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> the Cotieri, the Anthusiani,the Psacæ, the Arimaspi,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> the Antacati, the Chroasai, and the<pb n="2035" />Œtei; among them the Napæi<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> are said to have been destroyedby the Palæi. The rivers in their country that are the bestknown, are the Mandragæus and the Carpasus. Indeed uponno subject that I know of are there greater discrepancies amongwriters, from the circumstance, I suppose, of these nationsbeing so extremely numerous, and of such migratory habits.Alexander the Great has left it stated that the water of thissea<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> is fresh, and M. Varro informs us, that some of it, of asimilar character, was brought to Pompey, when holding thechief command in the Mithridatic war in its vicinity; the salt,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>no doubt, being overpowered by the volume of water dischargedby the rivers which flow into it. He adds also, that under thedirection of Pompey, it was ascertained that it is seven days'journey from India to the river Icarus,<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> in the country of theBactri, which discharges itself into the Oxus, and that themerchandize of India being conveyed from it<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> through theCaspian Sea into the Cyrus, may be brought by land to Phasisin Pontus, in five days at most. There are numerous islandsthroughout the whole of the Caspian sea: the only one that iswell known is that of Tazata.<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Sacæ probably formed one of the most numerous and most powerful of the Scythian Nomad tribes, and dwelt to the east and north-eastof the Massagetæ, as far as Servia, in the steppes of Central Asia, which are now peopled by the Kirghiz Cossacks, in whose name that of theirancestors, the Sacæ, is traced by some geographers.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Meaning the "Great Getæ." They dwelt beyond the Jaxartes andthe Sea of Aral, and their country corresponds to that of the KhirghizTartars in the north of Independent Tartary.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Dahæ were a numerous and warlike Nomad tribe, who wanderedover the vast steppes lying to the east of the Caspian Sea. Strabo hasgrouped them with the Sacæ and Massagetæ, as the great Scythian tribesof Inner Asia, to the north of Bactriana.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See also B. iv. c. 20, and B. vi. c. 7. The position of the Essedones,or perhaps more correctly, the Issedones, may probably be assigned to theeast of Ichim, in the steppes of the central border of the Kirghiz, in theimmediate vicinity of the Arimaspi, who dwelt on the northern declivityof the Altaï chain. A communication is supposed to have been carried onbetween these two peoples for the exchange of the gold that was the produceof those mountain districts.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">They dwelt, according to Ptolemy, along the southern banks of theJaxartes.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or the Mardi, a warlike Asiatic tribe. Stephanus Byzantinus, following Strabo, places the Amardi near the Hyrcani, and adds, "Thereare also Persian Mardi, without the <hi rend="ital">a</hi>;" and, speaking of the Mardi, hementions them as an Hyrcanian tribe, of predatory habits, and skilled inarchery.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">D'Anville supposes that the Euchatæ may have dwelt at the modernKoten, in Little Bukharia. It is suggested, however, by Parisot, thatthey may have possibly occupied a valley of the Himalaya, in the midstof a country known as "Cathai," or the "desert."</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The first extant notice of them is in Herodotus; but before him therewas the poem of Aristeas of Proconnesus, of which the title was 'Arimaspea;' and it is mainly upon the statements in it that the stories told relative to this people rest—such as their being one-eyed, and as to their stealingthe gold from the Gryphes, or Griffins, under whose custody it was placed.Their locality is by some supposed to have been on the left bank of theMiddle Volga, in the governments of Kasan, Simbirsk, and Saratov: a locality which is sufficiently near the gold districts of the Uralian chainto account for the legends connecting them with the Gryphes, or guardiansof the gold.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The former reading was, "The Napæi are said to have perished aswell as the Apellæi." Sillig has, however, in all probability, restored thecorrect one. "Finding," he says, "in the work of Diodorus Siculus,that two peoples of Scythia were called, from their two kings, who werebrothers, the Napi and the Pali, we have followed close upon the footstepsof certain MSS. of Pliny, and have come to the conclusion that somedisputes arose between these peoples, which ultimately led to the destructionof one of them."</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Of the Caspian Sea.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Said on the supposition that it is a bay or gulf of the Scythian orSeptentrional Ocean.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ansart suggests that this is the modern Rocsha.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From the Oxus.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ansart suggests that this island is that now called Idak, one of theOgurtchinski group.</p></body>
