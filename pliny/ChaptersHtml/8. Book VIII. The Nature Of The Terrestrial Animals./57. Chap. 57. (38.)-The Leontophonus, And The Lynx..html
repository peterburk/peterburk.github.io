<div2 type="chapter" n="57" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 57. (38.)—THE LEONTOPHONUS, AND THE LYNX. <span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span></head><p>There are also two other animals, whose urine possessesvery wonderful properties. We have heard speak of a smallanimal, to which the name of leontophonus<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> has been given,and which is said to exist only in those countries where the lionis produced; if its flesh is only tasted by the lion, so intenselyvenomous is its nature, that this lord of the other quadrupedsinstantly expires. Hence it is, that the hunters of the lionburn its body to ashes, and sprinkle a piece of flesh with thepowder, and so kill the lion by means of the ashes even-sofatal to it is this poison! The lion, therefore, not withoutgood reason hates the leontophonus, and after destroying itssight, kills it without inflicting a bite: the animal, on theother hand, sprinkles the lion with its urine, being well awarethat this too is fatal to it.</p><p>The urine of the lynx, in the countries<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> where that animalis produced, either becomes crystallized, or else hardens into aprecious stone, resembling the carbuncle, and which shines liketire.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> This is called lyncurium;<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> and hence it is, that manypersons believe that this is the way in which amber is produced. The lynx, being well aware of this property, enviesus the possession of its urine, and therefore buries it in theearth;<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> by this, however, it becomes solid all the sooner.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">These statements are from the treatise De Mirab.
