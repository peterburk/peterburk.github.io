(6.)ÑTHE BEECH.</head><p>The acorn of the beech<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> is similar in appearance to a kernel,enclosed in a shell of triangular shape. The leaf is thin andone of the very lightest, is similar in appearance to that of thepoplar, and turns yellow with remarkable rapidity. From themiddle of the leaf, and upon the upper side of it, there mostlyshoots a little green berry, with a pointed top.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> The beech isparticularly agreeable to rats and mice; and hence it is, thatwhere this tree abounds, those creatures are sure to be plentiful also. The leaves are also very fattening for dormice,and good for thrushes too. Almost all trees bear an averagecrop but once in two years; this is the case with the beechmore particularly.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Fagus silvatica of Lamarck. Its Latin name, "fagus," is supposedto have been derived from the Greek <foreign lang="greek">fa/gw,</foreign> "to eat." An oil is extractedfrom the acorns or nuts, that is much used in some parts of France.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He speaks probably of one of the galls which are found attached tothe leaves of the forest trees.</p></body>
