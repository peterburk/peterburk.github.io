<div2 type="chapter" n="51" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 51.—THE MEROPS—PARTRIDGES.</head><p>No less, too, is the shrewdness displayed by those birds whichmake their nests upon the ground, because, from the extremeweight of their body, they are unable to fly aloft. There is abird, known as the "merops,"<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> which feeds its parents intheir retreat: the colour of the plumage on the inside is pale,and azure without, while it is of a somewhat reddish hue atthe extremity of the wings: this bird builds its nest in a holewhich it digs to the depth of six feet.</p><p>Partridges<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> fortify their retreat so well with thorns andshrubs, that it is effectually protected against beasts of prey.They make a soft bed for their eggs by burying them in thedust, but do not hatch them where they are laid: that no suspicion may arise from the fact of their being seen repeatedlyabout the same spot, they carry them away to some other place.The females also conceal themselves from their mates, in orderthat they may not be delayed in the process of incubation, asthe males, in consequence of the warmth of their passions, areapt to break the eggs. The males, thus deprived of the females,fall to fighting among themselves; and it is said that the onethat is conquered, is treated as a female by the other. TrogusPompeius tells us that quails and dunghill cocks sometimes dothe same; and adds, that wild partridges, when newly caught,or when beaten by the others, are trodden promiscuously bythe tame ones. Through the very pugnacity thus inspired bythe strength of their passions, these birds are often taken, asthe leader of the whole covey frequently advances to fight withthe decoy-Bird of the fowler; as soon as he is taken, another andthen another will advance, all of which are caught in theirturn. The females, again, are caught about the pairing season;for then they will come forward to quarrel with the femaledecoy-Bird of the fowler, and so drive her away. Indeed, inno other animal is there any such susceptibility in the sexualfeelings; if the female only stands opposite to the male, whilethe wind is blowing from that direction, she<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> will become impregnated; and during this time she is in a state of the<pb n="2517" />greatest excitement, the beak being wide open and the tonguethrust out. The female will conceive also from the action ofthe air, as the male flies above her, and very often from onlyhearing his voice: indeed, to such a degree does passion getthe better of her affection for her offspring, that although atthe moment she is sitting furtively and in concealment, shewill, if she perceives the female decoy-Bird of the fowler approaching her mate, call him back, and summon him awayfrom the other, and voluntarily submit to his advances.</p><p>Indeed, these birds are often carried away by such franticmadness, that they will settle, being quite blinded by fear,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>upon the very head of the fowler. If he happens to move inthe direction of the nest, the female bird that is sitting willrun and throw herself before his feet, pretending to be over-heavy, or else weak in the loins, and then, suddenly running or flying for a short distance before him, will fall downas though she had a wing broken, or else her feet; just as heis about to catch her, she will then take another fly, and sokeep baffling him in his hopes, until she has led him to a considerable distance from her nest. As soon as she is rid of herfears, and free from all maternal disquietude, she will throwherself on her back in some furrow, and seizing a clod ofearth with her claws, cover herself all over. It is supposedthat the life of the partridge extends to sixteen years.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Merops apiaster of Linnæus, or bee-eater.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier says that the red partridge, the Tetrao rufus of Linnæus, ismeant.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The same wonderful story is told by Aristotle, Hist.
