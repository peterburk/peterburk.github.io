<div2 type="chapter" n="23" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 23. (12.)—HOW THE RESIN CALLED ZOPISSA IS PREPARED.</head><p>We must not omit, too, that the Greeks call by the name ofzopissa<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> the pitch mixed with wax which has been scrapedfrom off the bottoms of sea-going ships;<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> for there is nothing,in fact, that has been left untried by mankind. This composition is found much more efficient for all those purposes inwhich pitch and resin are employed, in consequence of thesuperior hardness which has been imparted to it by the sea-salt.</p><p>The pitch-tree is opened<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> on the side that faces the sun,not by means of an incision, but of a wound made by the removal of the bark: this opening being generally two feet inwidth and one cubit from the ground, at the very least. Thebody of the tree, too, is not spared in this instance, as in others,for even the very chips from off it are considered as havingtheir use; those, however, from the lower part of the tree arelooked upon as the best, the wood of the higher parts givingthe resin a bitter<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> taste. In a short time all the resinousjuices of the entire tree come to a point of confluence in thewound so inflicted: the same process is adopted also with thetorch-tree. When the liquid ceases to flow, the tree is openedin a similar manner in some other part, and then, again, elsewhere: after which the whole tree is cut down, and the pith<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>of it is used for burning.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span></p><p>So, too, in Syria they take the bark from off the terebinth;and, indeed, in those parts they do not spare even the root orbranches, although in general the resin obtained from thoseparts is held in disesteem. In Macedonia they subject thewhole of the male larch to the action of fire, but of the female<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span><pb n="3364" />only the roots. Theopompus has stated in his writings that inthe territory of the Apolloniates there is found a kind of mineralpitch,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> not inferior to that of Macedonia. The best pitch<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>everywhere is that obtained from trees planted on sunny spotswith a north-east aspect; while that which is produced frommore shaded localities has a disagreeable look and a repulsiveodour. Pitch, too, that is produced amid the cold of winter isof inferior quality, being in smaller quantity, too, and comparatively colourless. Some persons are of opinion that in mountainous localities this liquid is produced in the greatest abundance, and that it is of superior colour and of a sweeter tasteand has a finer smell so long as it remains in a state of resin;but that when, on the other hand, it is subjected to boiling, ityields a smaller quantity of pitch, because so much of it goes<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>off in a serous shape. They say that the resinous trees, too,that grow on mountains are thinner than those that are foundon plains, but that they are apt, both of them, to be unproductive in clear, dry weather.</p><p>Some trees, too, afford a flow of resinous juice the year afterthe incision is made, some, again, in the second year, andothers in the third. The wound so made is filled with resin,but not with bark, or by the cicatrization of the outer coat;for the bark in this tree never unites. Among these varieties some authors have made the sappium<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> to constitute apeculiar kind, because it is produced from the seed of a kindred variety, as we have already stated when speaking of thenuts<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> of trees; and they have given the name of tæda<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> tothe lower parts of the tree; although in reality this tree is nothing else but a pitch-tree, which by careful cultivation haslost some small portion of its wild character. The name"sappinus" is also given to the timber of these trees whencut, as we shall have occasion to mention<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> hereafter.<pb n="3365" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Apparently meaning "boiled pitch."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxiv. c. 26.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This account has been borrowed from Theophrastus, Hist.
