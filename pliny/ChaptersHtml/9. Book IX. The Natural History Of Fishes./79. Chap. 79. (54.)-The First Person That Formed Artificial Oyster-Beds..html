<div2 type="chapter" n="79" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 79. (54.)—THE FIRST PERSON THAT FORMED ARTIFICIALOYSTER—BEDS.</head><p>The first person who formed artificial oyster-beds was Ser-<pb n="2468" />gius Orata,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> who established them at Baiæ, in the time of L.Crassus, the orator, just before the Marsic War. This wasdone by him, not for the gratification of gluttony, but of avarice, as he contrived to make a large income by this exerciseof his ingenuity. He was the first, too, to invent hangingbaths,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and after buying villas and trimming them up, hewould every now and then sell them again.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> He, too, was thefirst to adjudge the pre-eminence for delicacy of flavour to theoysters of Lake Lucrinus;<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> for every kind of aquatic animalis superior in one place to what it is in another. Thus, for instance, the wolf-fish of the river Tiber is the best that is caughtbetween the two bridges,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> and the turbot of Ravenna is themost esteemed, the murena of Sicily, the elops of Rhodes; thesame, too, as to the other kinds, not to go through all the itemsof the culinary catalogue. The British<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> shores had not as yetsent their supplies, at the time when Orata thus ennobled theLucrine oysters: at a later period, however, it was thoughtworth while to fetch oysters all the way from Brundisium, atthe very extremity of Italy; and in order that there mightexist no rivalry<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> between the two flavours, a plan has been<pb n="2469" />more recently hit upon, of feeding the oysters of Brundisiumin Lake Lucrinus, famished as they must naturally be after solong a journey.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He was a contemporary of L. Crassus, and was distinguished for hisgreat wealth, and his love of luxury and refinement, but possessed an unblemished character. His surname, Orata or Aurata, was given to him, itis said, because he was remarkably fond of gold-fish—auratæ pisces—though, according to other authorities, it was because he was in the habitof wearing two very large gold rings.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Pensiles balineas." This expression has been differently rendered byvarious commentators, but it is now generally supposed to refer to themanner in which the flooring of the bathing rooms was suspended over thehollow cells of the hypocaust or heating furnace. This is called by Vitruvius, "Suspensura caldariorum."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Ita mangonicatas villas subinde vendendo."—By the use of theword "ita," Pliny may possibly mean that he was in the habit of fillingup the villas with the "balineæ pensiles," which he had invented. "Mangonizo" was to set off or trim up a thing, that it might sell again all thebetter.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Varro speaks of those of Tarentum, as being the best. The Greekspreferred the oysters of Abydos; the Romans, under the empire, those ofBritain.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It does not appear to be known what two bridges are here alluded to;the Sublician, or wooden bridge, was probably one of them, and, perhaps,the Palatine bridge was the other. The former was built by AncusMartius.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">For some further account of the British oyster, see B. xxxii. c. 21.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxxii c. 21.</p></body>
