(1.)—THE NATURE OF FLOWERS AND GARLANDS.</head><p>Cato has recommended that flowers for making chapletsshould also be cultivated in the garden; varieties remarkablefor a delicacy which it is quite impossible to express, inas-much as no individual can find such facilities for describingthem as Nature does for bestowing on them their numerous tints—Nature, who here in especial shows herself in a sportivemood, and takes a delight in the prolific display of her variedproductions. The other<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> plants she has produced for our useand our nutriment, and to them accordingly she has grantedyears and even ages of duration: but as for the flowers andtheir perfumes, she has given them birth for but a day—amighty lesson to man, we see, to teach him that that which inits career is the most beauteous and the most attractive to theeye, is the very first to fade and die.</p><p>Even the limner's art itself possesses no resources for reproducing the colours of the flowers in all their varied tintsand combinations, whether we view them in groups alternately blending their hues, or whether arranged in festoons, eachvariety by<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> itself, now assuming a circular form, now runningobliquely, and now disposed in a spiral pattern: or whether,as we see sometimes, one wreath is interwoven within another.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxii. c. 1.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Sive privatis generum funiculis in orbem, in obliquum, in ambitarmquædam coronæ per coronas currunt." As we know but little of the formsof the garlands and chaplets of the ancients, the exact translation of thispassage is very doubtful.</p></body>
