Immediately after the winter solstice the days beginto increase, and by the time of the vernal equinox, or in otherwords, in ninety days and three hours, the day is equal inlength to the night. After this, for ninety-four days andtwelve hours, the days continue to increase, and the nights todiminish in proportion, up to the summer solstice; and fromthat point the days, though gradually decreasing, are still inexcess of the nights for ninety-two days, twelve hours, until theautumnal equinox. At this period the days are of equallength with the nights, and after it they continue to decreaseinversely to the nights until the winter solstice, a periodof eighty-eight days and three hours. In all these calculations, itmust be remembered, equinoctial<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> hours are spokenof, and not those measured arbitrarily in reference to thelength of any one day in particular. All these seasons, too,commence at the eighth degree of the signs of the Zodiac.The winter solstice begins at the eighth degree of Capricorn,the eighth<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> day before the calends of January, ingeneral;<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> thevernal equinox at the eighth degree of Aries; the summersolstice, at the eighth degree of Cancer; and the autumnalequinox at the eighth degree of Libra: and it is rarely that<pb n="4079" />these days do not respectively give some indication of a changein the weather.</p><p>These four seasons again, are subdivided, each of them, intotwo equal parts. Thus, for instance, between the summersolstice and the autumnal equinox, the setting of the Lyre,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>on the forty-sixth day, indicates the beginning of autumn; betweenthe autumnal equinox and the winter solstice, the morning setting ofthe Vergili¾, on the forty-fourth day, denotesthe beginning of winter; between the winter solstice and thevernal equinox, the prevalence of the west winds on the forty-fifthday, denotes the commencement of spring; and betweenthe vernal equinox and the summer solstice, the morning risingof the Vergili¾, on the forty-eighth day, announces thecommencement of summer. We shall here make seed-time, or inother words, the morning setting of the Vergili¾, ourstarting-point;<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> and shall not interrupt the thread of ourexplanationby making any mention of the minor constellations, as such acourse would only augment the difficulties that already exist.It is much about this period that the stormy constellation ofOrion departs, after traversing a large portion of the heavens.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He speaks of Equinoctial hours, these being in all cases of the samelength, in contradistinction to the Temporal, or Unequal hours, whichwith the Romans were a twelfth part of the Natural day, from sunrise tosunset, and of course were continually varying.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Twenty-fifth of December.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Fore.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In this Translation, the names of the Constellations are given inEnglish, except in the case of the signs of the Zodiac, which areuniversally known by their Latin appellations.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He begins in c. 64, at the winter solstice, and omits theperiod between the eleventh of November and the winter solsticealtogether, so far as the mention of individual days.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Cum sidus vehemens Orionis iisdem diebus longo decedat spatio."This passage is apparently unintelligible, if considered, asSillig readsit, as dependent on the preceding one.</p></body>
