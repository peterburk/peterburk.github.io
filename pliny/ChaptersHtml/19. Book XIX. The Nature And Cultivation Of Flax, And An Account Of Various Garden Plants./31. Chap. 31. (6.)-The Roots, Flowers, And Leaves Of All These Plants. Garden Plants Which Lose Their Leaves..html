<div2 type="chapter" n="31" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 31. (6.)—THE ROOTS, FLOWERS, AND LEAVES OF ALL THESEPLANTS. GARDEN PLANTS WHICH LOSE THEIR LEAVES.</head><p>Nearly all<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> the garden plants have a single<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> root only,radishes, beet, parsley, and mallows, for example; it is lapathum, however, that has the longest root of them all, it attaining the length of three cubits even. The root of the wildkind is smaller and of a humid nature, and when up it willkeep alive for a considerable period. In some of these plants,however, the roots are fibrous, as we find the case in parsleyand mallows, for instance; in others, again, they are of aligneous nature, as in ocimum, for example; and in others theyare fleshy, as in beet, and in saffron even more so. In some,again, the root is composed of rind and flesh, as in the radishand the rape; while in others it is jointed, as in hay grass<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>.Those plants which have not a straight root throw out immediately a great number of hairy fibres, orage<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and blite,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> forinstance: squills again, bulbs, onions, and garlic never haveany but a vertical root. Among the plants that grow spontaneously, there are some which have more numerous rootsthan leaves, spalax,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> for example, pellitory,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> and saffron.<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span></p><p>Wild thyme, southernwood, turnips, radishes, mint, and rueblossom all<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> at once; while others, again, shed their blossomdirectly they have begun to flower. Ocimum<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> blossoms gradu-<pb n="4171" />ally, beginning at the lower parts, and hence it is that it is sovery long in blossom: the same is the case, too, with the plantknown as heliotropium.<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> In some plants the flower is white,in others yellow, and in others purple. The leaves fall first<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>from the upper part in wild-marjoram and elecampane, andin rue<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> sometimes, when it has been injured accidentally.In some plants the leaves are hollow, the onion and the scallion,<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> more particularly.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This passage, and indeed nearly the whole of the Chapter, is borrowed from Theophrastus, Hist.
