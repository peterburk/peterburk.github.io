Varro, prefer to be indebted for his surname and reputeto the extensive use made by him of cold water as aremedy. He employed also various other soothing remediesfor his patients; thus, for instance, it was he that introducedswinging beds, the motion of which might either lull themalady, or induce sleep, as deemed desirable. It was he,too, that brought baths into such general use,—a method oftreatment that was adopted with the greatest avidity—inaddition to numerous other modes of treatment of a pleasantand soothing nature. By these means he acquired a greatprofessional reputation, and a no less extended fame; which<pb n="5158" />was very considerably enhanced by the following incident:meeting the funeral procession of a person unknown to him,he ordered the body to be removed from the funeral pile<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> andcarried home, and was thus the means of saving his life. Thiscircumstance I am the more desirous to mention, that it maynot be imagined that it was on slight grounds only that soextensive a revolution was effected in the medical art.</p><p>There is, however, one thing, and one thing only, at whichwe have any ground for indignation,-the fact, that a singleindividual, and he belonging to the most frivolous nation<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> inthe world, a man born in utter indigence, should all on asudden, and that, too, for the sole purpose of increasing hisincome, give a new code of medical laws to mankind; laws,however, be it remembered, which have been annulled bynumerous authorities since his day. The success of Asclepiades was considerably promoted by many of the usages of ancientmedicine, repulsive in their nature, and attended with far toomuch anxiety: thus, for instance, it was the practice to coverup the patient with vast numbers of clothes, and to adoptevery possible method of promoting the perspiration; to orderthe body to be roasted before a fire; or else to be continuallysending the patient on a search for sunshine, a thing hardly tobe found in a showery climate like that of this city of ours;or rather, so to say, of the whole of Italy, so prolific<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> as it isof fogs and rain.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> It was to remedy these inconveniences,that he introduced the use of hanging baths,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> an inventionthat was found grateful to invalids in the very highestdegree.</p><p>In addition to this, he modified the tortures which hadhitherto attended the treatment of certain maltdies; as inquinzy for instance, the cure of which before his time had beenusually effected by the introduction of an instrument<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> into thethroat. He condemned, and with good reason, the indiscriminate use of emetics, which till then had been resorted to in;<pb n="5159" />most extraordinary degree. He disapproved also of the practice of administering internally potions that are naturallyinjurious to the stomach, a thing that may truthfully be pronounced of the greater part of them. Indeed it will be as wellto take an early opportunity of stating what are the medicaments which actbeneficially upon the stomach.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. vii. c. 37.
