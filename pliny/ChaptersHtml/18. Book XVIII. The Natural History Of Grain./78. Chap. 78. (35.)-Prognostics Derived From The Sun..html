<div2 type="chapter" n="78" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 78. (35.)—PROGNOSTICS DERIVED FROM THE SUN.</head><p>Having now explained the theory of the winds, it seems tome the best plan, in order to avoid any repetition, to pass on tothe other signs and prognostics that are indicative of a changeof weather. I find, too, that this is a kind of knowledge thatgreatly interested Virgil,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> for he mentions the fact, that duringthe harvest even, he has often seen the winds engage in acombat that was absolutely ruinous to the improvident agriculturist.There is a tradition, too, to the effect that Democritus,already mentioned, when his brother Damasus was getting inhis harvest in extremely hot weather, entreated himtoleave the rest of the crop, and house with all haste that whichhad been cut; and it was only within a very few hours thathis prediction was verified by a most violent storm. On theother hand, it is particularly recommended never to plant reedsexcept when rain is impending, and only to sow corn just before ashower; we shall therefore briefly touch upon theprognostics of this description, making enquiry more particularlyinto those among them that have been found the most useful.</p><p>In the first place, then, we will consider those prognosticsof the weather which are derived from the sun.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> If the sun isbright at its rising, and not burning hot, it is indicative of fine<pb n="4118" />weather, but if pale, it announces wintry weather accompaniedwith hail. If the sun is bright and clear when it sets, andit' it rises with a similar appearance, the more assured of fineweather may we feel ourselves. If it is hidden in clouds atits rising, it is indicative of rain, and of wind, when the cloudsare of a reddish colour just before sunrise; if black clouds areintermingled with the red ones, they betoken rain as well.When the sun's rays at its rising or setting appear to unite,rainy weather may be looked for. When the clouds are red atsunset, they give promise<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> of a fine day on the morrow; butif, at the sun's rising, the clouds are dispersed in various quarters, some to the south, and some to the north-east, even thoughthe heavens in the vicinity of the sun may be bright, they aresignificant of rain and wind. If at the sun's rising or setting, its rays appear contracted, they announce the approach ofa shower. If it rains at sunset, or if the sun's rays attract theclouds towards them, it is portentous of stormy weather on thefollowing day. When the sun, at its rising, does not emitvivid rays, although there are no clouds surrounding it, rainmay be expected. If before sunrise the clouds collect intodense masses, they are portentous of a violent storm; but ifthey are repelled from the east and travel westward, they indicatefine weather. When clouds are seen surrounding theface of the sun, the less the light they leave, the more violentthe tempest will be: but if they form a double circle roundthe sun, the storm will be a dreadful one. If this takes placeat sunrise or sunset, and the clouds assume a red hue, the approachof a most violent storm is announced: and if the cloudshang over the face of the sun without surrounding it, theypresage wind from the quarter from which they are drifting,and rain as well, if they come from the south.</p><p>If, at its rising, the sun is surrounded with a circle, windmay be looked for in the quarter in which the circle breaks;but if it disappears equally throughout, it is indicative of fineweather. If the sun at its rising throws out its rays afarthrough the clouds, and the middle of its disk is clear, therewill be rain; and if its rays are seen before it rises, both rainand wind as well. If a white circle is seen round the sun atits setting, there will be a slight storm in the night; but if there<pb n="4119" />is a mist around it, the storm will be more violent. If the sunis pale at sunset, there will be wind, and if there is a darkcircle round it, high winds will arise in the quarter in whichthe circle breaks.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Georg. i. 313, <hi rend="ital">et seq.</hi><lb />"Sæpe ego, quum flavis messorem induceret arvis<lb />Agricola, et fragili jam stringeret hordea culmo,<lb />Omnia ventorum concurrere prœlia vidi."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See the Treatise of Theophrastus on the Prognostics of theWeather.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This, Fée observes, is confirmed by experience.
