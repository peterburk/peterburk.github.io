(36.)ÑINSTANCES OF THE HIGHEST DEGREE OF AFFECTION.</head><p>Infinite is the number of examples of affection which havebeen known in all parts of the world; but one in particularoccurred at Rome, to which no other can possibly be compared. A woman of quite the lower class, and whose namehas consequently not come down to us, having lately givenbirth to a child, obtained permission to visit her mother,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> whowas confined in prison; but was always carefully searched bythe gaoler before being admitted, to prevent her from intro-<pb n="2181" />ducing any food. At last, however, she was detected nourishing her mother with the milk of her breast; upon which, inconsideration of the marvellous affection of the daughter, themother was pardoned, and they were both maintained for therest of their days at the public charge; the spot, too, wasconsecrated to Piety, a temple to that goddess being built onthe site of the prison, in the consulship<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> of C. Quintius andM. Acilius, where the theatre of Marcellus<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span><span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> now stands.</p><p>The father of the Gracchi, on finding [two] serpents in hishouse, consulted the soothsayers, and received an answer tothe effect, that he would survive if the serpent of the othersex was put to death.Ñ"No," said he, "rather kill the serpent of my own sex, for Cornelia is still young, and mayyet bear children."<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> Thus did he shew himself ready, atthe same moment, to spare his wife and to benefit the state;and shortly after, his wish was accomplished. M. Lepidusdied of regret for his wife, Apuleia, after having been divorcedfrom her.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> P. Rupilius,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> who was at the time affected by aslight disease, instantly expired, upon news being brought tohim that his brother had failed in obtaining the consulship.P. Catienus Plotinus was so much attached to his patron, that onfinding himself named heir to all his property, he threw himself on the funeral pile.<pb n="2182" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Solinus and Festus differ somewhat from Pliny, in stating that itwas her father whose life was thus saved by the affectionate daughter.Valerius Maximus, who tells the story, says that the family was "ingenuisanguinis," meaning "of genteel origin." Such families were, however,sometimes reduced, even among the Romans, to a level with the plebeianclasses.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A.U.C. 604.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This theatre is again mentioned in B. xxxvi. c. 12. It was built ofstone, and erected by Augustus in honour of his nephew Marcellus.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is related by Valerius Maximus, B. v. c. 8, somewhat more indetail, and with a degree of animation, which is not frequently to be metwith in that author.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cicero, De Divin. B. i. c. 18, Val. Maximus, B. iv. c. 6, and Plutarch,relate this more circumstantially. The serpents were of different sexes; ifthe male serpent was killed, his own death was to be the consequence; ifthe female, that of his wife, Cornelia.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny gives an account of the circumstances which attended the deathof Lepidus, in the 54th Chapter. He was the father of the triumvir.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or Rutilius, consul B.C. <date value="-132" authname="-132">132</date>, the year after the death of TiberiusGracchus, whose adherents he prosecuted with the greatest cruelty. Healso obtained a triumph for bringing to a conclusion the Servile war. Hewas an intimate friend of the younger Scipio Africanus, who obtained theconsulship for him, but failed in gaining that honour for his brother Lucius.About the same period, he was condemned, in the tribuneship of CaiusGracchus, for his illegal acts in the prosecution of the adherents of Tiberius Gracchus. It has been suggested that this indignity may have had agreater share than the ill success of his brother in causing his death.</p></body>
