<div2 type="chapter" n="53" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 53. (52.)—PERSONS WHO HAVE COME TO LIFE AGAIN AFTER BEING LAID OUT FOR BURIAL.</head><p>Aviola,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> a man of consular rank, came to life again whenon the funeral pile; but, by reason of the violence of the flames,no assistance could be rendered him, in consequence of whichhe was burnt alive. The same thing is said to have happenedto L. Lamia, a man of prætorian rank. Messala, Rufus,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> andmany other authors, inform us, that C. Ælius Tubero, who hadfilled the office of prætor, was also rescued from the funeral pile.Such then is the condition of us mortals: to these and the likevicissitudes of fortune are we born; so much so, that we cannotbe sure of any thing, no, not even that a person is dead. Withreference to the soul of man, we find, among other instances,that the soul of Hermotinus of Clazomenæ was in the habit ofleaving his body, and wandering into distant countries, whenceit brought back numerous accounts of various things, whichcould not have been obtained by any one but a person who waspresent. The body, in the meantime, was left apparently lifeless.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> At last, however, his enemies, the Cantharidæ,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> as theywere called, burned the body, so that the soul, on its return, wasdeprived of its sheath, as it were. It is stated also, that in Pro-<pb n="2211" />connesus,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> the soul of Aristeas was seen to fly out of his mouth,under the form of a raven;<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> a most fabulous story, however,which may be well ranked with the one that follows. It istold of Epimenides<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> of Cnossus, that when he was a boy, beingfatigued by heat and walking, he fell asleep in a cave, where heslept for fifty-seven years; and that when he awoke, as thoughit had been on the following day, he was much astonished at thechanges which he saw in the appearance of every thing aroundhim: after this, old age, it is said, came upon him in an equalnumber of days with the years he had slept, but his life wasprolonged to his hundred and fifty-seventh year.<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> The femalesex appear more especially disposed to this morbid state,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> onaccount of the misplacement of the womb;<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> when this is oncecorrected, they immediately come to themselves again. Thevolume of Heraclides<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> on this subject, which is highly esteemedamong the Greeks, contains the account of a female, who was restored to life, after having appeared to be dead for seven days.<pb n="2212" /></p><p>Varro informs us,<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> that when he was one of the "viginti.viri," or twenty commissioners,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> appointed to superintend thedivision of the lands at Capua, a man who had been carried to thefuneral pile, returned on foot from the Forum to his own house,and that the very same thing happened also at Aquinum. Hestates also, that Corfidius, who had married his maternal aunt,came to life again, after the funeral had been all arranged, andthat he afterwards attended the funeral of the person who hadso arranged his own. He gives in addition some other marvellous relations, the whole of which it may be as well to setforth; he says that there were two brothers, members of theequestrian order, and named Corfidius:<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> it so happened thatthe elder of these was seen to breathe his last to all appearance, and on opening his will, it was found that he had namedhis brother his heir, who accordingly ordered his funeral. Inthe meanwhile, however, he who had been thought to be dead,clapping his hands,<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> summoned the servants, and told themthat he was just come from his brother's house, who had placedhis daughter in his charge; in addition to which, he had mentioned to him the place where he had secretly buried some gold,and had requested that the funeral preparations which had beenmade, might be employed for himself. While he was statingto this effect, the servants of his brother came in the greatesthaste, and informed them that he was dead: the gold too,<pb n="2213" />was found in the place just as he had stated. But throughoutthe whole of our lives we are perpetually hearing of such predictions as these; they are not, however, worth collecting,seeing that they are almost always false, as we shall illustrateby the following remarkable instance.</p><p>In the Sicilian war, Gabienus, the bravest of all Cæsar'snaval commanders, was taken prisoner by Sextus Pompeius,who ordered his throat to be cut; after which, his head almostsevered from his body, he lay the whole of the day upon the seashore. Towards evening, with groans and entreaties, he beggedthe crowds of people who had assembled, that they wouldprevail upon Pompeius to come to him, or else send one of hismost confidential friends, as he had just returned from theshades below, and had some important news to communicate.Pompeius accordingly sent several of his friends, to whomGabienus stated that the good cause and virtuous partisans ofPompeius were well pleasing to the infernal deities, and thatthe event would shortly prove such as he wished: that he hadbeen ordered to announce to this effect, and that, as a proof ofits truthfulness, he himself should expire the very momenthe had fulfilled his commission; and his death actually didtake place.</p><p>We have instances also of men who have been seen aftertheir burial; but, for the present, we are treating of the operations of nature, and not of miracles.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We have an account of the death of Aviola, in Valerius Maximus,B. i. c. 8. This name occurs in the Consular Fasti, A.U.C. 806; but itcould not be that of the person referred to by Valerius Maximus, as hiswork was published under the reign of Tiberius, who died A.U.C. 789. Wehave also an account of the death of Lamia in Valerius Maximus, as occurring under the same circumstances with that of Aviola.—B.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Poinsinet, vol. iii. pp. 251, 252, supposes, that Messala and Rufus arethe names of two writers, and not, as usually supposed, of one only. Theconjecture appears not improbable.—B.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Plutarch, "De Deo Socratis," gives us the same account of Hermotinus. Ajasson has remarked, not inaptly, that this story is very similarto the modern statements as to the effect of animal magnetism, Lemaire, iii.207.—B. Apuleius, in his "Defence," has a passage which is remarkableas clearly bearing reference to the doctrines inculcated by the mesmerists ofmodern times; he says, "Quin et illud mecum reputo, posse animum humanum, præsertim puerilem et simplicem seu carminum avocamento, sine odorum delenimento, soporari et ad oblivionem præsentium externari; et paulisper remotâ corporis memoriâ, redigi et redire ad naturam suam quæ estimmortalis scilicet et divina; atque ita veluti quodam sopore futura rerumpræsagire."</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We have no notice of any people, under this appellation, in Greece;Cantharus, however, occurs as the name of an individual, and possiblythese may have been his descendants, or the members of his family.—B.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. v. c. 44.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We have an account of Aristeas in Herodotus, iv. 13, but somewhatdifferent from that here given; Aristeas is also mentioned by Apolloniusin his Hist. Mirab., and A. Gellius, B. ix. c. 4.—B. He was an epic poet,who flourished in the time of Crœsus and Cyrus. Herodotus mentions astory that he reappeared at Metapontum, in Italy, 340 years after his death.He is generally represented as a magician, whose soul could leave, and reenter his body at pleasure.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A poet and prophet of Crete. The story was, that being sent by hisfather to fetch a sheep, he went into a cave, and fell into a sleep, from whichhe did not awake for fifty-seven years. On awaking, he sought for the sheep,and was astonished on finding everything altered. On returning home, hefound that his young brother had in the meantime become an aged man.His story is only equalled by the famous one of the Seven Sleepers of Da-mascus, who fell asleep in the time of the Decian persecution of the Christians, and slept in a cave till the thirtieth year of the reign of the Em-peror Theodosius, 196 years. It is not improbable that it is to this storyabout Epimenides, that we are indebted for the amusing story of Rip VanWinkle, by Washington Irving.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We have the life of Epimenides by Diogenes Laertius, who gives anaccount of this long-continued sleep. It is also mentioned by other writers,but there is some difference in their statements as to its length.—B.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">According to the interpretation of Dalechamps, "spiritus et animæinterceptioni ac privationi," "the interception and privation of the breathand faculties;" Lemaire, vol. iii. p. 208.—B.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He probably alludes to what are known among us as hysteria, or hysterical affections.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We have an account of Heracüdes in Diogenes Laertius; he was anative of Pontus, and a pupil of Aristotle.—B.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This circumstance is not mentioned in either of the two works of Varrowhich have come down to us, "De Re Rusticâ," and "De Linguâ Latinâ."—B.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">They were a body of commissioners appointed for the distribution oflands in Campania; Julius Cæsar, when consul, having caused a law to bepassed, dividing that territory among such of the Roman citizens as shouldhave three or more children.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We are not informed, whether these persons of the name of Corfidius,were in any way connected, nor, indeed, do we appear to have any certainknowledge of their history.—B. L. Corfidius, a Roman eques, is mentioned by Cicero, in his oration for Ligarius, B.C. <date value="-46" authname="-46">46</date>, as one of the distinguished men who were then interceding with Cæsar on behalf of Ligarius;but after the oration was published, Cicero was informed that he had madea mistake in mentioning the name of Corfidius, as he had died before thespeech was delivered. It does not appear certain that he was one of theparties here mentioned: but it is not improbable that he was the brotherwhose sudden death is mentioned below.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Among the ancients, servants used to be summoned by clapping thehands, as they are, in modern times, by ringing of bells.—B. The samepractice still prevails in the east.</p></body>
