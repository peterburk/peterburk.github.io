<div2 type="chapter" n="59" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 59.ÑPLANTS THAT WILL NOT GROW IN CERTAIN PLACES.</head><p>Balsamum<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> will grow nowhere but [in<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> Jud¾a]: and thecitron of Assyria refuses to bear fruit in any other country.The palm, too, will not grow everywhere, and even if it doesgrow in some places, it will not bear: sometimes, indeed, itmay make a show and promise of bearing, but even then itsfruit comes to nothing, it seeming to have borne them thus farin spite of itself. The cinnamon<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> shrub has not sufficientstrength to acclimatize itself in the countries that lie in thevicinity of Syria. Amomum,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> too, and nard,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> those mostdelicate of perfumes, will not endure the carriage from Indiato Arabia, nor yet conveyance by sea; indeed, King Seleucusdid make the attempt, but in vain. But what is more particularly wonderful, is the fact that most of the trees by caremay be prevailed upon to live when transplanted; for sometimes the soil may be so managed as to nourish the foreignerand give support to the stranger plant; climate, however, cannever be changed. The pepper-tree<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> will live in Italy, andcassia<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> in the northern climates even, while the incense-tree<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span><pb n="3397" />has been known to live in Lydia: but how are we to impartto these productions the requisite warmth of the sun, in orderto make all the crude juices go off by evaporation, and ripenthe resins that distil from them?</p><p>Nearly as great a marvel, too, is the fact that the nature ofthe tree may be modified by circumstances, and yet the treeitself be none the less vigorous in its growth. Nature originally gave the cedar<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> to localities of burning heat, and yetwe find it growing in the mountains of Lycia and Phrygia.She made the laurel, too, averse to cold, and yet there is notree that grows in greater abundance on Mount Olympus. Atthe city of Panticap¾um, in the vicinity of the Cimmerian Bosporus, King Mithridates and the inhabitants of the place usedevery possible endeavour, with a view to certain religiousceremonies, to cultivate the myrtle<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> and the laurel: they couldnot succeed, however, although trees abound there which require a hot climate, such as the pomegranate and the fig, aswell as apples and pears of the most approved quality. In thesame country, too, the trees that belong to the colder climates,such as the pine, the fir, and the pitch-tree, refuse to grow.But why go search for instances in Pontus? In the vicinityof Rome itself it is only with the greatest difficulty<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> that thecherry and the chesnut will grow, and the peach-tree, too, atTusculum: the Greek nut, too, is grown there from graftsonly at a cost of considerable labour, while Tarracina aboundswith whole woods of it.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or balm of Gilead.

The cassia of the Eastcould not possibly survive in Italy. The fact is, no doubt, that the Romansgave the names of cassia, piper, and amomunm, to certain indigenous plants,and then persuaded themselves that they had the genuine plants of theEast.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xii. c. 30.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Under the name of Cedrus, no doubt, several of the junipers havebeen included.
