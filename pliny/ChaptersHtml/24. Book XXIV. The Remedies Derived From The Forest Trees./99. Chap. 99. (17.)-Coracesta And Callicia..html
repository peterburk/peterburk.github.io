(17.)—CORACESTA AND CALLICIA.</head><p>While I am treating of plants of a marvellous nature, I aminduced to make some mention of certain magical plants—forwhat, in fact, can there be more marvellous than they? The firstwho descanted upon this subject in our part of the world werePythagoras and Democritus, who have adopted the accountsgiven by the Magi. Coracesta<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and callicia, according toPythagoras, are plants which congeals<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> water. I find nomention made of them, however, by any other author, and hehimself gives no further particulars relative to them.<pb n="5063" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Dalechamps considers these appeilations to mean the "virgins' plant,"and the "plant of beauty."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Cissampelos Pareira, as already stated, abounds in mucilagesuch a degree, as to impart a consistency to water, without impairing itstransparency.
