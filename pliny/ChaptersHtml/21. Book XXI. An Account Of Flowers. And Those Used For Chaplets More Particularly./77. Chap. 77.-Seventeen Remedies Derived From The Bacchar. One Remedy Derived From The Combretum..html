It is very useful for the stingsof serpents, head-ache and burning heats in the head, and<pb n="4369" />for defluxions of the eyes. It is applied topically for swellingsof the mamillæ after delivery, as also incipient fistulas<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> of theeyes, and erysipelas; the smell of it induces sleep. It isfound very beneficial to administer a decoction of the root forspasms, falls with violence, convulsions, and asthma. For aninveterate cough, three or four roots of this plant are boileddown to one-third; this decoction acting also as a purgativefor women after miscarriage, and removing stitch in the side,and calculi of the bladder. Drying powders<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> for perspirationare prepared also from this plant; and it is laid among garments for the smell.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> The combretum which we have spoken<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>of as resembling the bacchar, beaten up with axle-grease, is amarvellous cure for wounds.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Ægilopiis."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Diapasmata."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This, as Fée remarks, can hardly apply to the Digitalis purpurea ofLinnæus, with which he has identified it, the smell of which is disagreeable rather than otherwise.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In c. 16 of this Book.</p></body>
