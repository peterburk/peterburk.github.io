<div2 type="chapter" n="19" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 19. (4.)—THE PLEASURES OF THE GARDEN.</head><p>Having made mention of these productions, it now remainsfor us to return to the cultivation of the garden,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> a subjectrecommended by its own intrinsic merits to our notice: for wefind that in remote antiquity, even, there was nothing lookedupon with a greater degree of admiration than the gardens ofthe Hesperides,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> those of the kings Adonis<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and Alci-<pb n="4150" />noüs,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and the Hanging Gardens, whether they were the work ofSemiramis, or whether of Cyrus, king of Assyria, a subject ofwhich we shall have to speak in another work.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> The kings ofRome cultivated their gardens with their own hands; indeed,it was from his garden that Tarquinius Superbus<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> sent to hisson that cruel and sanguinary message of his. In our laws ofthe Twelve Tables, we find the word "villa," or "farm,"nowhere mentioned; it is the word "hortus" that is alwaysused with that signification, while the term "heredium" wefind employed for "garden."</p><p>There are certain religious impressions, too, that have beenattached to this species of property,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> and we find that it is inthe garden and the Forum only that statues of satyrs are con-secrated, as a protection against the evil effects<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> of spells andsorcery; although in Plautus, we find the gardens spokenof as being under the tutelage of Venus. At the present day,under the general name of gardens,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> we have pleasure-groundssituate in the very heart of the City, as well as extensive fieldsand villas.</p><p>Epicurus, that connoisseur<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> in the enjoyments of a life ofease, was the first to lay out a garden at Athens;<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> up to histime it had never been thought of, to dwell in the country inthe middle of the town. At Rome, on the other hand, thegarden<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> constituted of itself the poor man's field, and it wasfrom the garden that the lower classes procured their dailyfood—an aliment how guiltlessly obtained! But still, it is agreat deal better, no doubt,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> to dive into the abysses of the<pb n="4151" />deep, and to seek each kind of oyster at the risk and peril ofshipwreck, to go searching for birds beyond the river Phasis<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>even, which, protected as they are by the terrors invented byfable,<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> are only rendered all the more precious thereby—to gosearching for others, again, in Numidia,<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> and the very sepulchres of Æthiopia,<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> or else to be battling with wild beasts,and to get eaten one's self while trying to take a prey whichanother person is to eat! And yet, by Hercules! how little dothe productions of the garden cost us in comparison with these!How more than sufficient for every wish and for every want!—were it not, indeed, that here, as in every thing else, turn whichway we will, we find the same grounds for our wrath and in-dignation. We really might be content to allow of fruits beinggrown of the most exquisite quality, remarkable, some ofthem for their flavour, some for their size, some, again, for themonstrosities of their growth, morsels all of them forbidden tothe poor!<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> We might allow of wines being kept till they aremellowed with age, or enfeebled by being passed through<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span>cloth strainers, of men, too, however prolonged their lives,never drinking any but a wine that is still older than themselves! We might allow of luxury devising how best to extract the very aroma, as it were, and marrow<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> only from grain;of people, too, living upon nothing but the choicest productionsof the confectioner, and upon pastes fashioned in fantasticshapes: of one kind of bread being prepared for the rich, andanother for the multitude; of the yearly produce of the fieldbeing classified in a descending scale, till it reaches the humblemeans of the very lowest classes—but do we not find thatthese refined distinctions have been extended to the veryherbs even, and that riches have contrived to establish pointsof dissimilarity in articles of food which ordinarily sell fora single copper coin?<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span></p><p>In this department even, humble as it is, we are still des-<pb n="4152" />tined to find certain productions that are denied to the community at large, and the very cabbages pampered to such anenormous extent that the poor man's table is not large enoughto hold them. Asparagus, by Nature, was intended to growwild,<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> so that each might gather it where he pleased—but,lo and behold! we find it in the highest state of cultivation,and Ravenna produces heads that weigh as much as threepounds<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span> even! Alas for the monstrous excess of gluttony!It would be surprising indeed, for the beasts of the field to beforbidden the thistle for food, and yet it is a thing forbidden<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span>to the lower classes of the community! These refined distinctions, too, are extended to the very water even, and, thanksto the mighty influence of money, there are lines of demarcation drawn in the very elements themselves. Some personsare for drinking ice, others for quaffing snow, and thus is thecurse of the mountain steep turned into an appetizing stimulus for the palate!<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span> Cold is carefully treasured up for thesummer heats, and man's invention is racked how best to keepsnow freezing in months that are not its own. Some againthere are who first boil the water,<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span> and then bring it to thetemperature of winter—indeed, there is nothing that pleasesman in the fashion in which Nature originally made it.</p><p>And is it the fact, then, that any herb of the garden isreared only for the rich man's table? It is so—but still letno one of the angered populace think of a fresh secession toMount Sacer or Mount Aventine; for to a certainty, in the longrun, all-powerful money will bring them back to just thesame position as they were in when it wrought the severance.For, by Hercules!<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span> there was not an impost levied at Rome<pb n="4153" />more grievous than the market-dues, an impost that arousedthe indignation of the populace, who repeatedly appealed withloud clamours to all the chief men of the state to be relieved fromit. At last they were relieved from this heavy tax upon theirwares; and then it was found that there was no tax morelucrative, more readily collected, or less obnoxious to the caprices of chance, than the impost that was levied in exchangefor it, in the shape of a property-tax, extended to the poorestclasses: for now the very soil itself is their surety that paidthe tax will be, their means are patent to the light of day, andthe superficial extent of their possessions, whatever the weathermay chance to be, always remains the same.</p><p>Cato,<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span> we find, speaks in high praise of garden cabbages:—indeed, it was according to their respective methods of gardencultivation that the agriculturists of early times were appreciated, and it was immediately concluded that it was a sign of awoman being a bad and careless manager of her family, whenthe kitchen-garden—for this was looked upon as the woman'sdepartment more particularly—was negligently cultivated; asin such case her only resource was, of course, the shambles orthe herb-market. But cabbages were not held in such highesteem in those days as now: indeed, all dishes were held indisrepute which required something else to help them down,the great object being to economize oil as much as possible;and as to the flesh-market, so much as a wish even to taste itswares was visited with censure and reproach. The chief thingthat made them so fond of the garden was the fact that itsproduce needs no fire and ensures economy in fuel, and that itoffers resources which are always ready and at hand. Thesearticles of food, which from their peculiar nature we call"vinegar-diets,"<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span> were found to be easy of digestion, by nomeans apt to blunt and overload the senses, and to create but littlecraving for bread as an accompaniment. A portion of them whichis still used by us for seasonings, attests that our forefathers used<pb n="4154" />only to look at home for their resources, and that no Indianpeppers were in request with them, or any of those other condi-ments which we are in the habit of seeking beyond the seas.In former times the lower classes of Rome, with their mimicgardens in their windows, day after day presented the reflexof the country to the eye, when as yet the multitudes of atrocious burglaries, almost innumerable, had not compelled us toshut out all such sights with bars to the passers by.</p><p>Let the garden, then, have its due meed of honour, and letnot things, because they are common, enjoy for that the lessshare of our consideration—and the more so, as we find thatfrom it men of the very highest rank have been content toborrow their surnames even; thus in the Valerian family,for instance, the Lactucini have not thought themselvesdisgraced by taking their name from the lettuce. Perhaps,too, our labours and research may contribute some slight recommendation to this our subject; although, with Virgil,<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span> weare ready to admit how difficult it is, by language howeverelevated, to ennoble a subject that is so humble in itself.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">As Fée observes, by the word "hortus" the Romans understoodsolely the "vegetable" or "kitchen-garden;" the pleasure garden beinggenerally denominated "horti."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. v. c. 1.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A fabulous king of Phœnicia, probably, whose story was afterwardstransferred, with considerable embellishments, to the Grecian mythology.Adonis is supposed to have been identical with the Thammuz of Scripture,mentioned by Ezekiel, viii. 14, where he speaks of the "women weep-ing for Thammuz."
