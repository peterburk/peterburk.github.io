<div2 type="chapter" n="24" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 24. (21.)—THE DUNGHILL COCK.</head><p>Next after the peacock, the animal that acts as our watchman by night, and which Nature has produced for the purposeof arousing mortals to their labours, and dispelling their slumbers, shows itself most actuated by feelings of vanity. Thecock knows how to distinguish the stars, and marks thedifferent periods of the day, every three hours, by his note.These animals go to roost with the setting of the sun, and atthe fourth watch of the camp recall man to his cares and toils.They do not allow the rising of the sun to creep upon us un-awares, but by their note proclaim the coming day, and theyprelude their crowing by clapping their sides with their wings.They exercise a rigorous sway over the other birds of their<pb n="2497" />kind, and, in every place where they are kept, hold the supremecommand. This, however, is only obtained after repeatedbattles among themselves, as they are well aware that theyhave weapons on their legs, produced for that very purpose, asit were, and the contest often ends in the death of both thecombatants at the same moment. If, on the other hand, oneof them obtains the mastery, he instantly by his note proclaimshimself the conqueror, and testifies by his crowing that he hasbeen victorious; While his conquered opponent silently slinksaway, and, though with a very bad grace, submits to servitude.And with equal pride does the throng of the poultry yard strutalong, with head uplifted and crest erect. These, too, are theonly ones among the winged race that repeatedly look up tothe heavens, with the tail, which in its drooping shape resembles that of a sickle, raised aloft: and so it is that thesebirds inspire terror even in the lion,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> the most courageous ofall animals.</p><p>Some of these birds, too, are reared for nothing but warfareand perpetual combats, and have even shed a lustre therebyon their native places, Rhodes and Tanagra. The next rankis considered to belong to those of Melos<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and Chalcis. Hence,it is not without very good reason that the consular purple ofRome pays these birds such singular honours. It is from thefeeding of these creatures that the omens<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> by fowls are derived; it is these that regulate<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> day by day the movements ofour magistrates, and open or shut to them their own houses,as the case may be; it is these that give an impulse to thefasces of the Roman magistracy, or withhold them; it is thesethat command battles or forbid them, and furnish auspices forvictories to be gained in every part of the world. It is thesethat hold supreme rule over those who are themselves the rulersof the earth, and whose entrails and fibres are as pleasing tothe gods as the first spoils of victory. Their note, when heardat an unusual hour or in the evening, has also its peculiar presages; for, on one occasion, by crowing the whole night throughfor several nights, they presaged to the Boeotians that famous<pb n="2498" />victory<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> which they gained over the Lacedæmonians; such,in fact, being the interpretation that was put upon it by wayof prognostic, as this bird, when conquered, is never known tocrow.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. viii. c. 19.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Possibly Media; Varro says, " Medicos."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Tripudia solistima."
