The fish of this class, known as the shells of Venus,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>are able to navigate the surface of the deep, and, presenting tothe wind their concave side, catch the breeze, and sail along onthe surface of the sea. Scallops are also able to leap<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> andfly above the surface of the water, and they sometimes employtheir shell by way of a bark.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Univalves, with a thick spinous shell.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The flat shell-fish, for instance, according to Cuvier, of the genuspatella, or lepas.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Other fish of the genus patella, only more concave; the haliotes, forinstance.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Forming a prolonged cone, Cuvier says, like the cerites.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The mouth of which is shaped like a crescent; such as the helices,Cuvier says.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The nerites, Cuvier says, which are cut into two hemispheres.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Such as many of the whelks, Cuvier says.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The whelks that have the edge turned inwards, so that one lip appearsto fold under the other.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">As no two naturalists might probably agree as to the exact meaning ofthe terms here employed, it has been thought advisable to give the passageas it appears in the original: "Jam distinctione virgulata, crinita, crispa,cuniculatim, pectinatim divisa, imbricatim undata, cancellatim reticulata,in obliquum, in rectum expansa, densata, porrecta, sinuata, brevi nodo legatis, toto latere connexis, ad plausum apertis, ad buccinum recurvis."</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In allusion, probably, to the streaks or lines drawn upon the exterior ofthe shell.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">With the mouth wide open, like that of a person in the act of applauding.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">By "ad buccinum recurvis," he probably alludes to a whelk, or fishwith a turbinated shell, resembling the larger conch or trumpet shell, whichTriton is sometimes described as blowing.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably some of the Cypræa; which have been already alluded to inNote 6 to c. 41 of the present Book. Cuvier remarks, that there are manyof the univalve shell-fish that float on the surface of the water, but none,with the exception of the argonauta or nautilus, are known to employ amembranous sail.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier says, that he has been informed that the scallop, by suddenlybringing together the valves of its shell, is able to make a bound, and leapabove the surface of the water.</p></body>
