(2.)—THE LATIN AUTHORS WHO HAVE WRITTEN UPONTHESE PLANTS.</head><p>This subject has not been treated of by the writers in ourown language so extensively as it deserves, eager as they haveproved themselves to make enquiry into everything that iseither meritorious or profitable. M. Cato, that great masterin all useful knowledge, was the first, and, for a long time, theonly author who treated of this branch<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> of learning; andbriefly as he has touched upon it, he has not omitted to makesome mention of the remedial treatment of cattle. After him,another illustrious personage, C. Valgius,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> a man distinguishedfor his erudition, commenced a treatise upon the same subject,which he dedicated to the late Emperor Augustus, but leftunfinished. At the beginning of his preface, replete as it iswith a spirit of piety,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> he expresses a hope that the majesticsway of that prince may ever prove a most efficient remedyfor all the evils to which mankind are exposed.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">As Fée remarks, it is more as a writer upon Agriculture than uponMateria Medica, that Cato is entitled to the thanks of posterity.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See end of B. xx.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">His piety, apparently, was tainted with adulation.</p></body>
