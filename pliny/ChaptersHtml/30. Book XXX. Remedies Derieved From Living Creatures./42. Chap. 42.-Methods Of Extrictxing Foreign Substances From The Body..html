The snails, too, that are found in clustersupon leaves, are pounded and applied with their shells on; asalso those that are used as food, the shells being first removed,applied with hare's rennet in particular. The bones of asnake, applied with the rennet of any four-footed animal, willproduce a similar effect before the end of two days: cantha-rides, also, bruised applied with barley-meal, are highlyextolled.</p></div2></body>
