<div2 type="chapter" n="1" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 1.—THE NATURE OF FLAX—MARVELLOUS FACTS RELATIVETHERETO.</head><p>WE have now imparted a knowledge<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> of the constellationsand of the seasons, in a method unattended with difficulty forthe most ignorant even, and free from every doubt; indeed,to those who understand these matters aright, the face of theearth contributes in no less a degree to a due appreciation ofthe celestial phenomena, than does the science of astronomyto our improvement in the arts of agriculture.</p><p>Many writers have made it their next care to treat ofhorticulture; but, for my own part, it does not appear to mealtogether advisable to pass on immediately to that subject, and,indeed, I am rather surprised to find that some among thelearned, who have either sought the pleasures of knowledge inthese pursuits, or have grounded their celebrity upon them,have omitted so many particulars in reference thereto; for nomention do we find in their writings of numerous vegetableproductions, both wild as well as cultivated, many of whichare found, in ordinary life, to be of higher value and of moreextended use to man than the cereals even.</p><p>To commence, then, with a production which is of an utility thatis universally recognized, and is employed not onlyupon dry land but upon the seas as well, we will turn our attention to flax,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> a plant which is reproduced from seed, butwhich can neither be classed among the cereals nor yet amongthe garden plants. What department is there to be found ofactive life in which flax is not employed? and in what production ofthe earth are there greater marvels<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> revealed to us<pb n="4130" />than in this? To think that here is a plant which bringsEgypt in close proximity to Italy!—so much so, in fact, thatGalerius<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and Balbillus,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> both of them prefects of Egypt, madethe passage to Alexandria from the Straits of Sicily, the onein six days, the other in five! It was only this very last summer,that Valerius Marianus, a senator of prætorian rank,reached Alexandria from Puteoli in eight days, and that, too,with a very moderate breeze all the time! To think thathere is a plant which brings Gades, situate near the Pillars ofHercules, within six days of Ostia, Nearer Spain within three,the province of Gallia Narbonensis within two, and Africawithin one!—this last passage having been made by C. Flavius, whenlegatus of Vibius Crispus, the proconsul, and that,too, with but little or no wind to favour his passage!</p><p>What audacity in man! What criminal perverseness! thusto sow a thing in the ground for the purpose of catching thewinds and the tempests, it being not enough for him, forsooth,to be borne upon the waves alone! Nay, still more than this,sails even that are bigger than the very ships themselves willnot suffice for him, and although it takes a whole tree tomake a mast to carry the cross-yards, above those cross-yardssails upon sails must still be added, with others swelling at theprow and at the stern as well—so many devices, in fact, tochallenge death! Only to think, in fine, that that whichmoves to and fro, as it were, the various countries of the earth,should spring from a seed so minute, and make its appearancein a stem so fine, so little elevated above the surface of theearth! And then, besides, it is not in all its native strengththat it is employed for the purposes of a tissue; no, it mustfirst be rent asunder, and then tawed and beaten, till it isreduced to the softness of wool; indeed, it is only by suchviolence done to its nature, and prompted by the extremeaudacity of man, and<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> * * * that it is rendered subservient to hispurposes. The inventor of this art has been<pb n="4131" />already mentioned by us on a more appropriate occasion;<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> notsatisfied that his fellow-men should perish upon land, butanxious that they should meet their end with no sepulchralrites to await them, there are no execrations<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> to be found thatcan equal his demerits!</p><p>It is only in the preceding Book<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> that I was warning theagriculturist, as he values the grain that is to form our dailysustenance, to be on his guard against the storm and the tempest; andyet, here we have man sowing with his own hand,man racking his invention how best to gather, an object theonly aspirations of which upon the deep are the winds ofheaven! And then, too, as if to let us understand all the betterhow highly favoured is this instrument of our punishment,there is no vegetable production that grows with greater facility;<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>and, to prove to us that it is in despite of Nature her-self that it exists, it has the property of scorching<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> the groundwhere it is grown, and of deteriorating the quality of the verysoil itself.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">More particularly in B. xvii. cc. 2 and 3, and B. xviii. cc. 57–75.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Linum usitatissimum of Linnæus.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">What would he have said to the application of the powers of steam,and the electric telegraph?</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Possibly Galerius Trachalus, Consul A.D. <date value="68" authname="68">68</date>, a relation of GaleriaFundana, the wife of the Emperor Vitellius.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Governor of Egypt in the reign of Nero, A.D. <date value="55" authname="55">55</date>.
