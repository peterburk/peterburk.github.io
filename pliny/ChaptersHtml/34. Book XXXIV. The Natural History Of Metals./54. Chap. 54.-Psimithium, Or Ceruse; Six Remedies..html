The most esteemed comes fromRhodes. It is made from very fine shavings of lead, placedover a vessel filled with the strongest vinegar; by which meansthe shavings become dissolved. That which falls into thevinegar is first dried, and then pounded and sifted, afterwhich it is again mixed with vinegar, and is then dividedinto tablets and dried in the sun, during summer. It is alsomade in another way; the lead is thrown into jars filled withvinegar, which are kept closed for ten days; the sort of mouldthat forms upon the surface is then scraped off, and the lead isagain put into the vinegar, until the whole of the metal isconsumed. The part that has been scraped off is trituratedand sifted, and then melted in shallow vessels, being stirredwith ladles, until the substance becomes red, and assumes theappearance of sandarach. It is then washed with fresh water,until all the cloudy impurities have disappeared, after whichit is dried as before, and divided into tablets.</p><p>Its properties are the same as those of the substances above<pb n="6220" />mentioned.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> It is, however, the mildest of all the preparationsof lead; in addition to which, it is also used by femalesto whiten the complexion.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> It is, however, like scum ofsilver, a deadly poison. Melted a second time, ceruse becomes red.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">According to Ajasson, this substance is properly a sub-carbonate oflead, commonly called white lead.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Scoria of lead and molybd¾na.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Preparations of lead are still used in cosmetics for whitening thecomplexion.</p></body>
