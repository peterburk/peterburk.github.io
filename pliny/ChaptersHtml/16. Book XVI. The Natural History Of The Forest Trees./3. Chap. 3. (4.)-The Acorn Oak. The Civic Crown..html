<div2 type="chapter" n="3" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 3. (4.)—THE ACORN OAK. THE CIVIC CROWN.</head><p>It is with the leaves of this class of trees that our civiccrown is made, the most glorious reward that can be bestowedon military valour, and, for this long time past, the emblem ofthe imperial<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> clemency; since the time, in fact, when, after<pb n="3342" />the impiety of civil war, it was first deemed a meritoriousaction not to shed the blood of a fellow-citizen. Far inferiorto this in rank are the mural<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> crown, the vallar,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and thegolden<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> one, superior though they may be in the value of thematerial: inferior, too, in merit, is the rostrate<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> crown, thoughennobled, in recent times more particularly, by two great names,those of M. Varro,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> who was presented with it by PompeiusMagnus, for his great achievements in the Piratic War, and ofM. Agrippa, on whom it was bestowed by Cæsar, at the endof the Sicilian War, which was also a war against pirates.</p><p>In former days the beaks<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> of vessels, fastened in front of thetribunal, graced the Forum, and seemed, as it were, a crownplaced upon the head of the Roman people itself. In latertimes, however, they began to be polluted and trodden underfoot amid the seditious movements of the tribunes, the publicinterest was sacrificed to private advantage, each citizensought solely his own advancement, and everything lookedupon as holy was abandoned to profanation—still, from amidall this, the Rostra<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> emerged once again, and passed frombeneath the feet of the citizens to their heads. Augustuspresented to Agrippa the rostrate crown, while he himselfreceived the civic crown<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> at the hands of all mankind.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He alludes to the crown of oak-leaves, which was suspended on thegates before the palace of the emperors. A civic crown had been voted bythe senate to Julius Cæsar, on the ground of having saved his country.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Given to the first man who scaled the wall of a besieged place. Itwas made of gold, and decorated with turrets.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Given to the first soldier who surmounted the vallum or entrenchments. It was made of gold, and ornamented with "valli," or palisades.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">One of the varieties of the triumphal crown was the "corona aurea,"or "golden crown."</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Made of gold, and decorated with the "rostra," or "beaks" of ships.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. vii. c. 31.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The orator's stage in the Forum was decorated with the "rostra," or"beaks" of the ships of the Antiates; hence it received the name of "Rostrum."
