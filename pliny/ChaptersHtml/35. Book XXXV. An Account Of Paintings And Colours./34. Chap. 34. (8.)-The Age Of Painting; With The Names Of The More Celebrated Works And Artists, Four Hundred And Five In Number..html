<div2 type="chapter" n="34" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 34. (8.)—THE AGE OF PAINTING; WITH THE NAMES OFTHE MORE CELEBRATED WORKS AND ARTISTS, FOUR HUNDREDAND FIVE IN NUMBER.</head><p>I shall now proceed to enumerate, as briefly as possible, themore eminent among the painters; it not being consistent withthe plan of this work to go into any great lengths of detail.It must suffice therefore, in some cases, to name the artist in acursory manner only, and with reference to the account given ofothers; with the exception, of course, of the more famous pro-<pb n="6247" />ductions of the pictorial art, whether still in existence ornow lost, all of which it will be only right to take some noticeof. In this department, the ordinary exactness of the Greekshas been somewhat inconsistent, in placing the painters somany Olympiads after the statuaries and toreutic<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> artists, andthe very first of them so late as the ninetieth Olympiad; seeingthat Phidias himself is said to have been originally a painter,and that there was a shield at Athens which had been paintedby him: in addition to which, it is universally agreed that inthe eighty-third Olympiad, his brother Panænus<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> painted, atElis,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> the interior of the shield of Minerva, which had beenexecuted by Colotes,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> a disciple of Phidias and his assistantin the statue of the Olympian Jupiter.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> And then besides, is itnot equally admitted that Candaules, the last Lydian king of therace of the Heraclidæ, very generally known also by the nameof Myrsilus, paid its weight in gold for a picture by the painterBularchus,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> which represented the battle fought by him withthe Magnetes? so great was the estimation in which the artwas already held. This circumstance must of necessity havehappened about the period of our Romulus; for it was in theeighteenth Olympiad that Candaules perished, or, as somewriters say, in the same year as the death of Romulus: a thingwhich clearly demonstrates that even at that early period theart had already become famous, and had arrived at a state ofgreat perfection.</p><p>If, then, we are bound to admit this conclusion, it must beequally evident that the commencement of the art is of muchearlier date, and that those artists who painted in monochrome,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>and whose dates have not been handed down to us,must have flourished at even an anterior period; Hygiænon,namely, Dinias, Charmadas,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> Eumarus, of Athens, the first who<pb n="6248" />distinguished the sexes<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> in painting, and attempted to imitateevery kind of figure; and Cimon<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> of Cleonæ, who improvedupon the inventions of Eumarus.</p><p>It was this Cimon, too, who first invented foreshortenings,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>or in other words, oblique views of the figure, and who firstlearned to vary the features by representing them in thevarious attitudes of looking backwards, upwards, or downwards.It was he, too, who first marked the articulations ofthe limbs, indicated the veins, and gave the natural folds andsinuosities to drapery. Panænus, too, the brother of Phidias,even executed a painting<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> of the battle fought by the Athenianswith the Persians at Marathon: so common, indeed, hadthe employment of colours become, and to such a state of perfectionhad the art arrived, that he was able to represent, it issaid, the portraits of the various generals who commanded atthat battle, Miltiades, Callimachus, and Cynægirus, on theside of the Athenians, and, on that of the barbarians, Datisand Artaphernes.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Toreutæ."

"Monochromata," as we shall see inChapter 36, were painted at all times, and by the greatest masters.

Eumarus, perhaps, may have beenthe first to give to each sex its characteristic style of design, in the compositions,draperies, attitudes, and complexions of the respective sexes.Wornum thinks that, probably, Eumarus, and certainly, Cimon, belongedto the class of ancient tetrachromists, or polychromists, painting in a varietyof colours, without a due, or at least a partial, observance of thelaws of light and shade.

Böttiger is of opinion that he flourishedabout the 80th Olympiad. It is probable, however, that he livedlong before the age of Polygnotus; but some time after that of Eumarus.Wornum thinks that he was probably a contemporary of Solon, a centurybefore Polygnotus.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Catagrapha."</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This picture was placed in the Pœcile at Athens, and is mentionedalso by Pausanias, B. i. c. 15, and by Æschines, Ctesiph. s. 186.</p></body>
