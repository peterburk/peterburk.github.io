Hence it is,that some persons are of opinion that they were particularlyfond of aromatites:<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> but Fabius Dossennus quite decidesthe question, in the following line:—"I sent them goodwine, myrrh-wine;"<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> and in his play called "Acharistio," wefind these words-" Bread and pearled barley, myrrh—winetoo." I find, too, that Scævola and L. Ælius, and AteiusCapito, were of the same opinion; and then we read in theplay known as the "Pseudolus:"<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>—" But if it is requisite forhim to draw forth what is sweet from the place, has he aughtof that?" to which Charinus makes answer," Do you ask<pb n="3254" />the question? He has myrrh wine, raisin wine, defrutum,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>and honey;" from which it would appear that myrrh winewas not only reckoned among the wines, but among the sweetwines too.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Called "myrrhina." Fée remarks that the flavour of myrrh is acridand bitter, its odour strong and disagreeable, and says that it is difficult toconceive how the ancients could drink wine with this substance in solution.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">As the "Persa" has come down to us, we find no mention of myrrhin the passage alluded to.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xii. c. 49.
