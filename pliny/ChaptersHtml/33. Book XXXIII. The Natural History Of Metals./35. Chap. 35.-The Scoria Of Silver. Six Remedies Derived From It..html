<div2 type="chapter" n="35" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 35.—THE SCORIA OF SILVER. SIX REMEDIES DERIVED FROM IT.</head><p>The scoria of silver is called by the Greeks "helcysma."<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span><pb n="6117" />It has certain restringent and refrigerative effects upon bodies,and, like molybdæna, of which we shall make further mentionwhen speaking<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> of lead, is used as an ingredient in makingplasters, those more particularly which are to promote thecicatrization of wounds. It is employed also for the cure oftenesmus and dysentery, being injected in the form of a clysterwith myrtle-oil. It forms an ingredient, too, in the medicamentsknown as "liparæ,"<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> for the removal of fleshy excrescencesin sores, ulcerations arising from chafing, or runningulcers on the head.</p><p>The same mines also furnish us with the preparation knownas "scum of silver."<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> There are three<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> varieties of it; thebest, known as "chrysitis;" the second best, the name ofwhich is "argyritis;" and a third kind, which is called"molybditis." In most instances, too, all these tints are tobe found in the same cake.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span></p><p>The most approved kind is that of Attica; the next beingthat which comes from Spain. Chrysitis is the produce ofthe metallic vein,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> argyritis is obtained from the silver itself,and molybditis is the result of the smelting of lead,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> a workthat is done at Puteoli; to which last circumstance, in fact, molybditisowes its name.<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> All these substances are prepared inthe following manner: the metal is first melted, and then allowedto flow from a more elevated receiver into a lower. Fromthis last it is lifted by the aid of iron spits, and is then twirledround at the end of the spit in the midst of the flames, inorder to make it all the lighter. Thus, as may be easily per-<pb n="6118" />ceived from the name, it is in reality the scum of a substancein a state of fusion—of the future metal, in fact. It differsfrom scoria in the same way that the scum of a liquid differsfrom the lees, the one<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> being an excretion thrown out bythe metal while purifying itself, the other<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> an excretion ofthe metal when purified.</p><p>Some persons distinguish two kinds of scum of silver, andgive them the names of "scirerytis" and "peumene;<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> a thirdvariety being molybdæna, of which we shall have to makefurther mention when treating of lead.<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> To make this scumfit for use, the cakes are again broken into pieces the sizeof a hazel-nut, and then melted, the fire being briskly blownwith the bellows. For the purpose of separating the charcoaland ashes from it, it is then rinsed with vinegar or with wine,and is so quenched. In the case of argyritis, it is recommended,in order to blanch it, to break it into pieces the sizeof a bean, and then to boil it with water in an earthen vessel,first putting with it, wrapped in linen cloths, some new wheatand barley, which are left there till they have lost the outercoat. This done, they bruise the whole in mortars for six consecutivedays, taking care to rinse the mixture in cold waterthree times a day, and after that, in an infusion of hotwater and fossil salt, one obolus of the latter to every poundof scum: at the end of the six days it is put away for keepingin a vessel of lead.</p><p>Some persons boil it with white beans and a ptisan<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> ofbarley, and then dry it in the sun; others, again, with whitewool and beans, till such time as it imparts no darkness to thewool; after which, first adding fossil<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> salt, they change thewater from time to time, and then dry it during the forty hot-test days of summer. In some instances the practice is, toboil it in water in a swine's paunch, and then to take it outand rub it with nitre; after which, following the precedingmethod, they pound it in a mortar with salt. Some again<pb n="6119" />never boil it, but pound it only with salt, and then rinse itwith water.</p><p>Scum of silver is used as an ingredient in eye-salves, and,in the form of a liniment, by females, for the purpose of removingspots and blemishes caused by scars, as also in washesfor the hair. Its properties are desiccative, emollient, refrigerative,temperative, and detergent. It fills up cavities inthe flesh produced by ulceration, and reduces tumours. Forall these purposes it is employed as an ingredient in plaster,and in the liparæ previously mentioned.<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> In combinationwith rue, myrtle, and vinegar, it removes erysipelas: and,with myrtle and wax, it is a cure for chilblains.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From <foreign lang="greek">e(/lkw</foreign>, "to drag"—in consequence of its viscous consistency,Hardouin says.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. xxxiv. c. 53.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cerates, adipose or oleaginous plasters.

Or perhaps, he thinks, they may have been the respectivenames of yellow or golden litharge, white or silver litharge, and terne.With the latter opinion Delafosse seems to coincide.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Tubulis."
