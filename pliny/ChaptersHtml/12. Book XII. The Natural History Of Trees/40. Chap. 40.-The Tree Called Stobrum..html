<div2 type="chapter" n="40" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 40.ÑTHE TREE CALLED STOBRUM.</head><p>The Arabians import from Carmania also the wood of atree called stobrum,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> which they employ in fumigations, bysteeping it in palm wine, and then setting fire to it. Theodour first ascends to the ceiling, and then descends in volumes<pb n="3136" />to the floor; it is very agreeable, but is apt to cause anoppression of the head, though unattended with pain; it isused for promoting sleep in persons when ill. For thesebranches of commerce, they have opened the city of Carr¾,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>which serves as an entrepot, and from which place they wereformerly in the habit of proceeding to Gabba, at a distance oftwenty days' journey, and thence to Pal¾stina, in Syria. Butat a later period, as Juba informs us, they began to take theroad, for the purposes of this traffic, to Charax<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and thekingdom of the Parthians. For my own part, it would appearto me that they were in the habit of importing these commodities among the Persians, even before they began to conveythem to Syria or Egypt; at least Herodotus bears testimony tothat effect, when he states that the Arabians paid a yearlytribute of one thousand talents, in frankincense, to the kingsof Persia.</p><p>From Syria they bring back storax,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> which, burnt uponthe hearth, by its powerful smell dispels that loathing of theirown perfumes with which these people are affected. For ingeneral there are no kinds of wood in use among them, exceptthose which are odoriferous; indeed, the Sab¾i are in thehabit of cooking their food with incense wood, while others,again, employ that of the myrrh tree; and hence, the smokeand smells that pervade their cities and villages are no otherthan the very same which, with us, proceed from the altars.For the purpose of qualifying this powerful smell, they burnstorax in goat-skins, and so fumigate their dwellings. So trueit is, that there is no pleasure to be found, but what the continual enjoyment of it begets loathing. They also burn thissubstance to drive away the serpents, which are extremelynumerous in the forests which bear the odoriferous trees.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is not known what wood is meant under this name.
