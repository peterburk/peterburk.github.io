<div2 type="chapter" n="69" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 69.—CAUSES OF STERILITY.</head><p>But we ought always to bear in mind, more particularly,that there are two varieties of evils that are inflicted upon theearth by the heavens. The first of these, known by us underthe name of "tempests," comprehends hail-storms, hurricanesand other calamities of a similar nature; when these take placeat the full moon, they come upon us with additional intensity.These tempests take their rise in certain noxious constellations,as already stated by us on several occasions, Arcturus, for instance,Orion, and the Kids.</p><p>The other evils that are thus inflicted upon us, supervene witha bright, clear sky, and amid the silence of the night, no onebeing sensible of them until we have perceived their effects.These dispensations are universal and of a totally differentcharacter from those previously mentioned, and have variousnames given to them, sometimes mildew, sometimes blast, andsometimes coal blight; but in all cases sterility is the infallibleresult. It is of these last that we have now to speak, enteringinto details which have not hitherto been treated of by anywriter; and first of all we will explain the causes of them.</p><p>(29.) Independently of the moon, there are two principalcauses of these calamities, which emanate more particularlyfrom two quarters of the heavens of but limited extent. Onthe one hand, the Vergiliæ exercise an especial influence on ourharvests, as it is with their rising that the summer begins, andwith their setting, the winter; thus embracing, in the space ofsix months, the harvest, the vintage, and the ripening of all thevegetable productions. In addition to this, there is a circulartract in the heavens, quite visible to the human eye even, known<pb n="4098" />as the Milky Way. It is the emanations from this, flowing asit were from the breast, that supply their milky<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> nutriment toall branches of the vegetable world. Two constellations moreparticularly mark this circular tract, the Eargle in the north,and Canicula in the south; of this last, we have already mademention<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> in its appropriate place. This circle traverses alsoSagittarius and Gemini, and passing through the centre of thesun, cuts the equinoctial line below, the constellation of theEagle making its appearance at the point of intersection onthe one side, and Canicula on the other. Hence it is that theinfluences of both these constellations develope themselvesupon all cultivated lands; it being at these points only that thecentre of the sun is brought to correspond with that of theearth. If, then, at the moments of the rising and the settingof these constellations, the air, soft and pure, transmits thesegenial and milky emanations to the earth, the crops will thriveand ripen apace; but if on the other hand, the moon, as already<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>mentioned, sheds her chilling dews, the bitterness thereof infusesitself into these milky secretions, and so kills thevegetation in its birth. The measure of the injury so inflictedon the earth depends, in each climate, upon the combination ofthe one or other of these causes; and hence it is that it is notfelt in equal intensity throughout the whole earth, nor evenprecisely at the same moment of time. We have already<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> saidthat the Eagle rises in Italy on the thirteenth day<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> before thecalends of January, and the ordinary course of Nature doesnot permit us before that period to reckon with any degree ofcertainty upon the fruits of the earth; for if the moon shouldhappen to be in conjunction at that time, it will be a necessaryconsequence, that all the winter fruits, as well as the earlyones, will receive injury more or less.</p><p>The life led by the ancients was rude and illiterate; still,as will be readily seen, the observations they made were notless remarkable for ingenuity than are the theories of the presentday. With them there were three set periods for gathering in theproduce of the earth, and it was in honour of theseperiods that they instituted the festive days, known as the<pb n="4099" />Robigalia,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> the Floralia, and the Vinalia. The Robigalia wereestablished by Numa in the fortieth year of his reign, and arestill celebrated on the seventh day before the calends of May,as it is at this period that mildew<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> mostly makes its firstattacks upon the growing corn. Varro fixes this crisis at themoment at which the sun enters the tenth degree of Taurus,in accordance with the notions that prevailed in his day: butthe real cause is the fact, that thirty-one<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> days after the vernalequinox, according to the observations of various nations, theDog-star sets between the seventh and fourth before the calends ofMay, a constellation baneful in itself, and to appeasewhich a young dog should first be sacrificed.<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> The same peoplealso, in the year of the City 513, instituted the Floralia, afestival held upon the fourth before<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> the calends of May, inaccordance with the oracular injunctions of the Sibyl, to securea favourable season for the blossoms and flowers. Varro fixesthis day as the time at which the sun enters the fourteenthdegree of Taurus. If there should happen to be a full moonduring the four days at this period, injury to the corn and allthe plants that are in blossom, will be the necessary result.The First Vinalia, which in ancient times were established onthe ninth before<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> the calends of May, for the purpose oftasting<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> the wines, have no signification whatever in reference tothe fruits of the earth, any more than the festivals alreadymentioned have in reference to the vine and the olive; thegermination of these last not commencing, in fact, till therising of the Vergiliæ, on the Sixth day before<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> the ides of<pb n="4100" />May, as already mentioned on previous occasions.<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> This, again,is another period of four days, which should never be blemishedby dews, as the chilling constellation of Arcturus, which setson the following day, will be sure to nip the vegetation; stililess ought there to be a full moon at this period.</p><p>On the fourth before<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> the nones of June, the Eagle risesagain in the evening, a critical day for the olives and vines inblossom, if there should happen to be a full moon. For mypart, I am of opinion that the eighth<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> before the calends ofJuly, the day of the summer solstice, must be a critical day, fora similar reason; and that the rising of the Dog-star, twenty-threedays after the summer solstice, must be so too, in casethe moon is then in conjunction; for the excessive heat is productiveof injurious effects, and the grape becomes prematurelyripened, shrivelled, and tough. Again, if there is a full noonon the fourth before<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> the nones of July, when Canicula rises tothe people of Egypt, or at least on the sixteenth before<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> thecalends of August, when it rises in Italy, it is productive ofinjurious results. The same is the case, too, fromthe thirteenth day before<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> the calends of August, when theEagle sets, to the tenth before<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> the calends of that month.The Second Vinalia, which are celebrated on the fourteenth<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span>before the calends of September, bear no reference to theseinfluences. Varro fixes them at; the period at which the Lyrebegins its morning setting, and says that this indicates thebeginning of autumn, the day having been set apart for the purpose ofpropitiating the weather: at the present day, however,it is observed that the Lyre sets on the sixth before<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> the idesof August.</p><p>Within these periods there are exerted the sterilizing influencesof the heavens, though I am far from denying thatthey may be considerably modified by the nature of the localityaccording as it is cold or hot. Still, however, it is sufficient forme to have demonstrated the theory; the modifications of its resultsdepending, in a great degree, upon attentive observation.It is beyond all question too, that either one of these two causes<pb n="4101" />will be always productive of its own peculiar effects, the fullmoon, I mean, or else the moon's conjunction. And here itsuggests itself how greatly we ought to admire the bounteousprovisions made for us by Nature; for, in the first place, thesecalamitous results cannot by any possibility befall us every year,in consequence of the fixed revolutions of the stars; nor indeed,when they do happen, beyond a few nights in the year, and itmay be easily known beforehand which nights those are likelyto be. In order, too, that we might not have to apprehend theseinjuries to vegetation in all the months, Nature has so ordainedthat the times of the moon's conjunction in summer, and of thefull moon in winter, with the exception of two days only atthose respective periods, are well ascertained, and that there isno danger to be apprehended on any but the nights of summer,and those nights the shortest of all; in the day-time, on theother hand, there is nothing to fear. And then, besides, thesephænomena may be so easily understood, that the ant even,that most diminutive of insects, takes its rest during the moon'sconjunction, but toils on, and that during the night as well, whenthe moon is at the full; the bird, too, called the "parra"<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span>disappears upon the day on which Sirius rises, and never reappearsuntil that star has set; while the witwall,<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span> on theother hand, makes its appearance on the day of the summersolstice. The moon, however, is productive of no noxiouseffects at either of these periods, except when the nights areclear, and every movement of the air is lulled; for so long asclouds prevail, or the wind is blowing, the night dews neverfall. And then, besides, there are certain remedies to counteractthese noxious influences.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">An onomatic prejudice, as Fée says, solely founded on the peculiarityof the name.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In the preceding Chapter.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In the preceding Chapter.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. xvi. c. 42.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Twentieth of December.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or festival in honour of Robigo, the Goddess of mildew, on thetwenty-fifth of April.
