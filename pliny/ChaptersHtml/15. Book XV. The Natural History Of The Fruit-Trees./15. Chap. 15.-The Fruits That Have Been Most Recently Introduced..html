<div2 type="chapter" n="15" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 15.—THE FRUITS THAT HAVE BEEN MOST RECENTLYINTRODUCED.</head><p>Why should I hesitate to make some mention, too, of other<pb n="3298" />varieties by name, seeing that they have conferred everlastingremembrance on those who were the first to introduce them,as having rendered some service to their fellow-men? UnlessI am very much mistaken, an enumeration of them will tendto throw some light upon the ingenuity that is displayed in theart of grafting, and it will be the more easily understood thatthere is nothing so trifling in itself from which a certainamount of celebrity cannot be ensured. Hence it is that wehave fruits which derive their names from Matius,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> Cestius,Mallius, and Scandius.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> Appius, too, a member of theClaudian family, grafted the quince on the Scandian fruit, inconsequence of which the produce is known as the Appian.This fruit has the smell of the quince, and is of the same sizeas the Scandian apple, and of a ruddy colour. Let no one,however, imagine that this name was merely given in a spiritof flattery to an illustrious family, for there is an apple knownas the Sceptian,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> which owes its name to the son of a freedman, who was the first to introduce it: it is remarkable forthe roundness of its shape. To those already mentioned,Cato<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> adds the Quirinian and the Scantian varieties, whichlast, he says, keep remarkably well in large vessels.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> Thelatest kind of all, however, that has been introduced is thesmall apple known as the Petisian,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> remarkable for its delightful flavour: the Amerinian<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> apple, too, and the little Greek<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>have conferred renown on their respective countries.</p><p>The remaining varieties have received their name fromvarious circumstances—the apples known as the "gemella"<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>are always found hanging in pairs upon one stalk, like twins,<pb n="3299" />and never growing singly. That known as the "syricum"<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>is so called from its colour, while the "melapium"<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> has itsname from its strong resemblance to the pear. The "musteum"<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> was so called from the rapidity with which it ripens;it is the melimelum of the present day, which derives its appellation from its flavour, being like that of honey. The"orbiculatum,"<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> again, is so called from its shape, which isexactly spherical—the circumstance of the Greeks having calledit the "epiroticum" proves that it came originally fromEpirus. The orthomastium<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> has that peculiar appellationfrom its resemblance to a teat; and the "spadonium"<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> of theBelgæ is so nicknamed from the total absence of pips. Themelofolium<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> has one leaf, and occasionally two, shooting fromthe middle of the fruit. That known as the "pannuceum"<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span>shrivels with the greatest rapidity; while the "pulmoneum"<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span>has a lumpish, swollen appearance.</p><p>Some apples are just the colour of blood, owing to an originalgraft of the mulberry; but they are all of them red on theside which is turned towards the sun. There are some smallwild<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> apples also, remarkable for their fine flavour and thepeculiar pungency of their smell. Some, again, are so remarkably<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> sour, that they are held in disesteem; indeed theiracidity is so extreme, that it will even take the edge from offa knife. The worst apples of all are those which from theirmealiness have received the name of "farinacea;"<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> they are<pb n="3300" />the first, however, to ripen, and ought to be gathered as soonas possible.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xii. c. 6.
