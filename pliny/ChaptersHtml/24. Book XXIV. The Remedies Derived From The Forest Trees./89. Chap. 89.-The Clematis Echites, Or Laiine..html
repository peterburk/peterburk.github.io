Its stems are about two Feet in height,and covered with leaves: in general appearance it is notunlike scammony, were it not that the leaves are darker andmore diminutive; it is found growing invineyards and cultivatedsoils. It is eaten as a vegetable, with oil and salt, and acts asa laxative upon the bowels. It is taken<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> also for dysentery,<pb n="5057" />with linseed, in astringent wine. The leaves of this plant areapplied with polenta for defluxions of the eyes, the partaffected being first covered with a pledget of wet linen. Appliedto scrofulous sores, they cause them to suppurate, and if someaxle-grease is then applied, a perfect cure will be effected.They are applied also to piles, with green oil, and are goodfor phthisis, in combination with honey. Taken with thefood, they increase the milk in nursing women, and, rubbedupon the heads of infants, they promote the rapid growth ofthe hair. Eaten with vinegar, they act as an aphrodisiac.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably the Asclepias nigra of Linnæus, black swallow-wort.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Asclepias nigra has no such medicinal effects as those mentionedby Pliny.</p></body>
