Theapharce<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> is another tree that is similar to the andrachle, andlike it, bears twice in the year: just as the grape is beginningto flower the first fruit is ripening, while the second fruitripens at the commencement of winter; of what nature thisfruit is we do not find stated.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Rhus cotinus of Linnæus, a sort of sumach.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is not the fact; the seeds when ripe are merely lost to view inthe large tufts of down which grow on the stems.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Generally supposed to be the same as the alaternus, mentioned inB. xvi. c. 45.
