<div2 type="chapter" n="43" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 43.—FISHES WHICH FLY ABOVE THE WATER. — THE SEA-SWALLOW. — THE FISH THAT SHINES IN THE NIGHT .— THE HORNED FISH. — THE SEA-DRAGON.</head><p>The sea-swallow,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> being able to fly, bears a strong resemblance to the bird of that name; the sea-kite<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> too, flies as well.</p><p>(27.) There is a fish that comes up to the surface of the sea,known, from the following circumstance, as the lantern-fish:<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>thrusting from its mouth a tongue that shines like fire, it emitsa most brilliant light on calm nights. Another fish, which,from its horns, has received its name,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> raises them nearly a<pb n="2416" />foot and a half above the surface of the water. The seadragon,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> again, if caught and thrown on the sand, works outa hole for itself with its muzzle, with the most wonderfulcelerity.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This name, Cuvier observes, is still common on the coasts of theMediterranean, to two kinds of flying fish, the Dactylopterus, or Triglavolitans of Linnæus, and the Exocœtus volitans of Linnæus. It is to thefirst, he thinks, that the ancients more especially gave the name of swallow,although Salvianus and Belon are of the contrary opinion. Oppian,Halieut. B. ii. 11. 457–461, ranks the sea-swallow with the scorpion, thedragon, and other fish the spines of which produce mortal wounds, andÆlian, B. ii. c. 5, states to the same effect. But the exocœtus has nospines, while the dactylopterus has terrible ones on its præopercules. Speusippus also, as quoted in Athenæus, B. vii., gives no less decisive testimony,in saying that the sea-cuckoo, the trigla, and the sea-swallow, have astrong resemblance to each other; the fact being that the dactylopterus isof the same genus as the sea-cuckoo, the Trigla cuculus of Linnæus.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ovid, Halieut. 1. 96, speaks of this fish as having a black back. Cuvier therefore suggests that it may possibly be the perlon, the Trigla hirundo of Linnæns, the back of which is of a dark brown, and the greatsize of the pectoral fins of which may have given rise to the notion of itsbeing able to fly. It is also very possible, he says, that it may have beenthe exocœtus, the back of which is of a blue colour.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Lucerna. Probably, as Cuvier says, one of those numerous molluscs,or zoophytes, which give out a brilliant light, and perhaps the Pyrosomaof Péron. No period being found in the MSS. after the word "milvus"—"kite," it was long thought that this passage applied to the sea-kite;and it is owing to this circumstance that we find the ichthyologists enumerating a Trigla lucerna. The correction, however, is approved of by Cuvier,who says that he has found none of the genus triglæ to give forth a light;except, indeed, when, like other fish, it begins to be putrid.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably the "cornuta," mentioned in the Note on the sea-ox in c. 40;see p. 411. Cuvier says that it was long supposed that the fish here alludedto might be the Malarmat of the Mediterranean, the Trigla cataphracta ofLinnæus, the muzzle of which is divided into two horns; but then theyare only half an inch long, instead of a foot and a half. He is of opinion,therefore, that it is the great horned ray, now known as the cephalopterus,which, being often fifteen feet and more in diameter, answers much betterto the description of its size implied by Pliny from the length of its horns.It is also mentioned under the name of cornuta in B. xxxii. c. 53, in company with the saw-fish, the sword-fish, the dog-fish, and other large fishes.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier is of opinion, that Rondelet is correct in his suggestion thatthis is the sea-spider, called the "vive" in France, the viver or weeverwith us, and the Trachinus draco of Linnæus, which fish is still called<foreign lang="greek">dra/kaina</foreign> by the modern Greeks. Pliny, in c. 48 of the present Book,charges the sea-spider with doing much mischief, by means of the spines orstickles on its back. Now Ælian, B. ii. c. 50, and Oppian, Halieut. 1. 458,say the same of the sea-dragon; and this is a well-known property of themodern vive, the Trachinus draco of Linnæus. Pliny speaks more especially,in B. xxxii. c. 53, of the wounds which it makes with the spines or sticklesof its opercules, which the vive is also able to inflict; and in addition tothis, it has the power of burrowing into the sand in a most incredibly shortspace of time.</p></body>
