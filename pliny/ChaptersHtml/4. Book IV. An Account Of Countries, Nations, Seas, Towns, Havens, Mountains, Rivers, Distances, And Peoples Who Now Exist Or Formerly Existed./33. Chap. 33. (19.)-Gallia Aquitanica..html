C. iii. 9), in conjunction with the Nannetes, Morini, and others, but nothing can be inferred as to the precise position they occupied.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Their locality also is unknown, but it is supposed that they dwelt in the vicinity of the department of La Vendée.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From them ancient Poitou received its name. They are supposed to have occupied the department of the Haute-Vienne, and portions of the departments of La Vendée, the Loire Inférieure, the Maine et Loire, the Deux-Sèvres, and La Vienne.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">They gave name to the former Saintonge, now the department of Charente and Charente Inférieure. The town of Saintes occupies the site of their chief town.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">They occupied the modern department of the Gironde. The city of Bordeaux occupies the site of their chief town.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">They gave name to Aquitaine, which became corrupted into Guyenne. Pliny is the only author that makes the Aquitani a distinct people of the province of Aquitanica. The Tarusates are supposed to have afterwards occupied the site here referred to by him, with Atures for their chief town, afterwards called Aire, in the department of the Landes.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Their locality is unknown, but it has been suggested that they occupied the departments of the Basses Pyrénées, or Lower Pyrenees.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">So called from the Latin verb <hi rend="ital">convenire,</hi> "to assemble" or "meet together." They are said to have received this name from the circumstance that Ptolemy, after the close of the Sertorian war, finding a pastoral people of predatory habits inhabiting the range of the Pyrenees, ordered them to unite together and form a community in a town or city. From them the present town of Saint Bertrand de Comminges, in the S.W. of the department of the Haute Garonne, derives its Latin name "Lugdunum Convenarum."</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">By Cæsar called the Bigerriones. Their name was preserved in that of the district of Bigorre, now the department of the Hautes-Pyrénées. Their chief town was Turba, now Tarbes.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">By calling the Tarbelli <hi rend="ital">Quatuorsignani,</hi> he seems to imply that their chief town was a place garrisoned by four maniples of soldiers, each with a <hi rend="ital">signum</hi> or standard. Aquæ Tarbellicæ was their chief town, the modern Acqs or Dax, in the S.W. of the department of the Landes.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Their chief town was probably garrisoned by six <hi rend="ital">signa</hi> or maniples. Cocosa, or Coequosa, as it is written in the Antonine Itinerary, is the first place on a road from Aque Tarbellicse or Dax to Burdegala or Bordeaux, now called Marensin. Their locality was in the southern part of the department of the Landes, the inhabitants of which are still divided into two classes, the Bouges, those of the north, or of the Tête de Buch; and the Cousiots, those of the south.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Their locality is unknown.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">D'Anville would read "Onobusates," and thinks that they dwelt in the district called Nébousan, in the department of the Hautes Pyrénées. He is also of opinion that their town stood on the site of the modern Cioutat, between the rivers Adour and Neste.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">They occupied the southern part of the department of the Gironde.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From them Hardouin suggests that Moneins, in the department of the Basses Pyrénées, takes its name.</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">D'Anville is of opinion that they inhabited and gave name to the Vallée d'Ossun, between the Pyrenees and the city of Oléron in the department of the Basses Pyrénées.</p><p><span id="note_17"><a href="#ref_17">17. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">D'Anville places them in the Vallée de Soule, in the department of the Basses Pyrénées.</p><p><span id="note_18"><a href="#ref_18">18. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From them Campon, a place in the department of the Hautes Pyrénées, is supposed to have received its name.</p><p><span id="note_19"><a href="#ref_19">19. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Biscarosse, not far from Tête de Buch in the department of the Landes, is supposed to derive its name from this tribe.</p><p><span id="note_20"><a href="#ref_20">20. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Nothing whatever is known of them.</p><p><span id="note_21"><a href="#ref_21">21. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The more general reading is "Sassumini." Ansart suggests that the town of Sarrum, between Cognac and Périgueux, in the department of the Dordogne, may have received its name from them.</p><p><span id="note_22"><a href="#ref_22">22. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ansart suggests that Rieumes, in the department of the Haute Garonne, occupies the site of Ryesium, their chief town, mentioned by Ptolemy.</p><p><span id="note_23"><a href="#ref_23">23. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">They are supposed to have given name to Tournay, in the department of the Hautes Pyrénées.</p><p><span id="note_24"><a href="#ref_24">24. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Supposed to be the same as the Consuarini, mentioned in B. iii. c. 5.</p><p><span id="note_25"><a href="#ref_25">25. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">They probably gave name to Auch, in the department of Gers.</p><p><span id="note_26"><a href="#ref_26">26. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Their chief town occupied the site of Euse or Eause, in the department of Gers.</p><p><span id="note_27"><a href="#ref_27">27. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Their locality is marked by Soz, in the department of the Lot-et-Garonne.</p><p><span id="note_28"><a href="#ref_28">28. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "Oscidates of the Plains."
