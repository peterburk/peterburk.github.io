Respecting this plantand the dracontium, there have been considerable differencesof opinion. Some writers, indeed, have maintained that theyare identical, and Glaucias has made the only distinctionbetween them in reference to the place of their growth,assuming that the dracontium is nothing else than the aron ina wild state. Some persons, again, have called the root "aron,"and the stem of the plant "dracontium:" but if the dracontium is the same as the one known to us as the "dracunculus,"<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> it is a different plant altogether; for while the aron hasa broad, black, rounded root, and considerably larger,Ñlargeenough, indeed, to fill the hand,Ñthe dracunculus has a<pb n="5058" />reddish root of a serpentine form, to which, in fact, it owes itsname.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. xix. c. 30.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">FŽe says that the Dracontion of the Greeks and the Dracunculus ofthe Latins are identical, being represented in modern Botany by the Arumdracunculus of Linn¾us, the common dragon.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From "draco," a "dragon" or "serpent."
