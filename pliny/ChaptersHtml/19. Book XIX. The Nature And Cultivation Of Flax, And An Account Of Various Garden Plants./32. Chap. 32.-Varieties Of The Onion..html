The Greekshave many varieties<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> of the onion, the Sardian onion, theSamothracian, the Alsidenian, the setanian, the schistan, andthe Ascalonian,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> so called from Ascalon,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> a city of Judæa.They have, all of them, a pungent smell, which<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> draws tearsfrom the eyes, those of Cyprus more particularly, and those ofCnidos the least of all. In all of them the body is composedof a cartilage of an unctuous<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> nature. The variety known asthe setanian is the smallest of them all, with the exception ofthe Tusculan<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> onion, but it is sweet to the taste. The schistan<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> and the Ascalonian kinds are used for storing. Theschistan onion is left during the winter with the leaves on; inthe spring it is stripped of them, upon which offsets make<pb n="4172" />their appearance at the same divisions as the leaves; it is tothis circumstance that this variety owes its name. Takingthe hint from this fact, it is recommended to strip the otherkinds of their leaves, to make them bulb all the better, insteadof running to seed.</p><p>The Ascalonian onion is of a peculiar nature, being barrenin some measure in the root; hence it is that the Greeks haverecommended it to be reproduced from seed, and not from roots:the transplanting, too, they say, should be done later in thespring, at the time the plant germinates, the result being thatit bulbs with all the greater rapidity, and hastens, as it were,to make up for lost time; great dispatch, however, is requisitein taking it up, for when ripe it rots with the greatest rapidity. If propagated from roots, it throws out a long stalk,runs rapidly to seed, and dies.</p><p>There are considerable differences, too, in the colour of theonion; the whitest of all are those grown at Issus and Sardes.The onions, too, of Crete are held in high esteem, but thereis some doubt whether they are not the same as the Ascalonianvariety; for when grown from seed they produce a fine bulb,but when planted they throw out a long stalk and run to seed;in fact, they differ from the Ascalonian kind only in the sweetness of their flavour.</p><p>Among us there are two principal varieties known of theonion; the scallion, employed for seasonings, is one, known tothe Greeks by the name of "gethyon," and by us as the "pallacana;" it is sown in March, April, and May. The otherkind is the bulbed or headed<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> onion; it is sown just after theautumnal equinox, or else after the west winds have begun toprevail. The varieties of this last kind, ranged according totheir relative degrees of pungency, are the African onion, theGallic, the Tusculan, the Ascalonian, and the Amiternian: theroundest in shape are the best. The red onion, too, is morepungent than the white, the stored than the fresh, the rawthan the cooked, and the dried than the preserved. The onionof Amiternum is cultivated in cold, humid localities, and isthe only one that is reproduced from heads,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> like garlic, theother kinds being grown from seed. This last kind yields no<pb n="4173" />seed in the ensuing summer, but a bulb only, which dries andkeeps; but in the summer after, the contrary is the case, forseed is produced, while the bulb very quickly spoils. Henceit is that every year there are two separate sowings, one ofseed for the reproduction of bulbs, and one of bulbs for thegrowth of seed; these onions keep best in chaff. The scallionhas hardly any bulb at all, but a long neck only—hence it isnothing but leaf, and is often cut down, like the leek; for thisreason, too, like the leek, it is grown from seed, and not fromplants.</p><p>In addition to these particulars, it is recommended that theground intended for sowing onions should be turned up threetimes, care being taken to remove all roots and weeds; tenpounds of seed is the proper proportion for a jugerum. Savorytoo, they say, should be mixed with them, the onions being allthe finer for it; the ground, too, should be stubbed and hoedfour times at least, if not oftener. In Italy, the Ascalonianonion is sown in the month of February. The seed of theonion is gathered when it begins to turn black, and before itbecomes dry and shrivelled.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Allium cepa of Linnæus</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The inhabitants of Pelusium, more particularly, were devoted to theworship of the onion.
