<div2 type="chapter" n="15" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 15.—GENERAL LAWS<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> OF THE PLANETS.</head><p>There are many other secrets of nature in these points, as<pb n="1049" />well as the laws to which they are subject, which might bementioned. For example, the planet Mars, whose course isthe most difficult to observe<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>, never becomes stationary whenJupiter is in the trine aspect, very rarely when he is 60 degreesfrom the sun, which number is one-sixth of the circuit of theheavens<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>; nor does he ever rise in the same sign with Jupiter,except in Cancer and Leo. The star Mercury seldom hashis evening risings in Pisces, but very frequently in Virgo,and his morning risings in Libra; he has also his morningrising in Aquarius, very rarely in Leo. He never becomesretrograde either in Taurus or in Gemini, nor until the 25thdegree of Cancer. The Moon makes her double conjunctionwith the sun in no other sign except Gemini, while Sagittarius is the only sign in which she has sometimes no conjunction at all. The old and the new moon are visible onthe same day or night in no other sign except Aries, andindeed it has happened very seldom to any one to have witnessed it. From this circumstance it was that the tale ofLynceus's quick-sightedness originated<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>. Saturn and Marsare invisible at most for 170 days; Jupiter for 36, or, at theleast, for 10 days less than this; Venus for 69, or, at the least,for 52; Mercury for 13, or, at the most, for 18<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Catholica."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"....quæ (stella Martis) ut maxime excentrica volvitur, motusetiam maxime dissonos habere diu visa est....;" Alexandre in Lemaire,ii. 180.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"....qui numerus sexangulas mundi efficit formas."</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Lynceus was one of the Argonauts and was celebrated for the acuteness of his vision; Val.
