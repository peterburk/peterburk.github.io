<div2 type="chapter" n="14" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 14.ÑREMEDIES DEPENDING UPON THE HUMAN WILL.</head><p>It would be the less becoming then for me to omit allmention of the remedies which depend upon the human will.Total abstinence from food or drink, or from wine only, fromflesh, or from the use of the bath, in cases where the healthrequires any of these expedients, is looked upon as one of themost effectual modes of treating diseases. To this class ofremedies must be added bodily exercise, exertion of the voice,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>anointings, and frictions according to a prescribed method:for powerful friction, it should be remembered, has a bindingeffect upon the body, while gentle friction, on the other hand,acts as a laxative; so too, repeated friction reduces thebody, while used in moderation it has a tendency to makeflesh. But the most beneficial practice of all is to take walking<pb n="5296" />or carriage<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> exercise; this last being performed in various ways.Exercise on horseback is extremely good for affections of thestomach and hips, a voyage for phthisis,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and a change oflocality<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> for diseases of long standing. So, too, a cure maysometimes be effected by sleep, by a recumbent position in bed,or by the use of emetics in moderation. To lie upon the backis beneficial to the sight, to lie with the face downwards isgood for a cough, and to lie on the side is recommended forpatients suffering from catarrh.</p><p>According to Aristotle and Fabianus, it is towards spring andautumn that we are most apt to dream; and they tell us thatpersons are most liable to do so when lying on the back, butnever when lying with the face downwards. Theophrastusassures us that the digestion is accelerated by lying on theright side; while, on the other hand, it is retarded by lyingwith the face upwards. The most powerful, however, of allremedies, and one which is always at a person's own command,is the sun: violent friction, too, is useful by the agency oflinen towels and body-scrapers.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> To pour warm water on thehead before taking the vapour-bath, and cold water after it, islooked upon as a most beneficial practice; so, too, is the habitof taking cold water before food, of drinking it every now andthen while eating, of taking it just before going to sleep, and,if practicable, of waking every now and then, and taking adraught. It is worthy also of remark, that there is no livingcreature but man<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> that is fond of hot drinks, a proof that theyare contrary to nature. It has been ascertained by experiment,that it is a good plan to rinse the mouth with undiluted wine,before going to sleep, for the purpose of sweetening the breath;to rinse the mouth with cold water an odd number of timesevery morning, as a preservative against tooth-ache; and towash the eyes with oxycrate, as a preventive of ophthalmia.It has been remarked also, that the general health is improvedby a varying regimen, subject to no fixed rules.<pb n="5297" /></p><p>(5.) Hippocrates informs us that the viscera of persons whodo not take the morning meal<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> become prematurely aged andfeeble; but then he has pronounced this aphorism, it must beremembered, by way of suggesting a healthful regimen, and notto promote gluttony; for moderation in diet is, after all, thething most conducive to health. L. Lucullus gave charge toone of his slaves to overlook him in this respect; and, a thingthat reflected the highest discredit on him, when, now an agedman and laden with triumphs, he was feasting in the Capitoleven, his hand had to be removed. from the dish to which hewas about to help himself. Surely it was a disgrace for a manto be governed by his own slave<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> more easily than by himself!</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "clara lectio," "reading aloud," as Celsus calls it, recommendingit for persons of slow digestion.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Gestatio."
