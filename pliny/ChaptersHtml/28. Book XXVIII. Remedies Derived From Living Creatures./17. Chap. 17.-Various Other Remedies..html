<div2 type="chapter" n="17" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 17.—VARIOUS OTHER REMEDIES.</head><p>To sit by a pregnant woman, or by a person to whom anyremedy is being administered, with the fingers of one handinserted between those of the other, acts as a magic spell; adiscovery that was made, it is said, when Alcmena<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> wasdelivered of Hercules. If the fingers are thus joined, claspingone or both knees, or if the ham of one leg is first put uponthe knee of the other, and then changed about, the omen is ofstill worse signification. Hence it is, that in councils held bygenerals and persons in authority, our ancestors forbade thesepostures, as being an impediment to all business.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> They havegiven a similar prohibition also with reference to sacrifices andthe offering of public vows; but as to the usage of uncoveringthe head in presence of the magistrates, that has been enjoined,Varro says, not as a mark of respect, but with a view tohealth, the head being strengthened<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> by the practice of keepingit uncovered.</p><p>When anything has got into the eye, it is a good plan toclose the other; and when water has got into the right ear,the person should hop about on the left foot, with the headreclining upon the right shoulder, the reverse being donewhen the same has happened to the left ear. If the secretionof the phlegm produces coughing, the best way of stopping itis for another person to blow in the party's face. When theuvula is relaxed, another person should take the patient withhis teeth by the crown,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and lift him from the ground; whilefor pains in the neck, the hams should be rubbed, and forpains in the hams the neck. If a person is seized in bed withcramp in the sinews of the legs or thighs, he should set hisfeet upon the ground: so, too, if he has cramp on the leftside, he should take hold of the great toe of the left foot withthe right hand, and if on the right side, the great toe of theright foot with the left hand. For cold shiverings or forexcessive bleeding at the nostrils, the extremities of the bodyshould be well rubbed with sheep's wool. To arrest incontinence of urine, the extremities of the generative organs should<pb n="5299" />be tied with a thread of linen or papyrus, and a binding passedround the middle of the thigh. For derangement of thestomach, it is a good plan to press the feet together, or toplunge the hands into hot water.</p><p>In addition to all this, in many cases it is found highly beneficial to speak but little; thus, for instance, Mæcenas Melissus,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> we are told, enjoined silence on himself for threeyears, in consequence of spitting blood after a convulsive fit.When a person is thrown from a carriage, or when, whilemounting an elevation or lying extended at full length, heis menaced with any accident, or if he receives a blow, it issingularly beneficial to hold the breath; a discovery for whichwe are indebted to an animal, as already<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> stated.</p><p>To thrust an iron nail into the spot where a person's headlay at the moment he was seized with a fit of epilepsy, is saidto have the effect of curing him of that disease. For pains inthe kidneys, loins, or bladder, it is considered highly soothingto void the urine lying on the face at full length in a recliningbath. It is quite surprising how much more speedily woundswill heal if they are bound up and tied with a Hercules' knot:<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>indeed, it is said, that if the girdle which we wear every dayis tied with a knot of this description, it will be productive ofcertain beneficial effects, Hercules having been the first todiscover the fact.</p><p>Demetrius, in the treatise which he has compiled upon thenumber Four, alleges certain reasons why drink should neverbe taken in proportions of four cyathi or sextarii. As a preventive of ophthalmia, it is a good plan to rub the parts behind the ears, and, as a cure for watery eyes, to rub the forehead. As to the presages which are derived from man himself, there is one to the effect that so long as a person is ableto see himself reflected in the pupil of the patient's eye,there need be no apprehension of a fatal termination to themalady.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See Ovid, Met. ix. 273, <hi rend="ital">et seq.</hi></p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Much more probably, because they were considered to be significantof anything but seriousness and attention.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Exemplified in the case of the Egyptians, Herodotus says.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The remedy would seem to be worse than the evil.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See end of B. vii.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. viii. c. 58.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A knot tied very hard, and in which no ends were to be seen.</p></body>
