<div2 type="chapter" n="11" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 11.—PLANTS WHICH SPRING UP AND GROW WITHOUT A ROOT—PLANTS WHICH GROW, BUT CANNOT BE REPRODUCED FROM SEED.</head><p>As we have here made a beginning of treating of the marvelsof Nature, we shall proceed to examine them in detail; andamong them the very greatest of all, beyond a doubt, is thefact that any plant should spring up and grow without a root.Such, for instance, is the vegetable production known as thetruffle;<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> surrounded on every side by earth, it is connectedwith it by no fibres, not so much as a single thread even, whilethe spot in which it grows, presents neither protuberance norcleft to the view. It is found, in fact, in no way adhering tothe earth, but enclosed within an outer coat; so much so, indeed, that though we cannot exactly pronounce it to be composed of earth, we must conclude that it is nothing else but acallous<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> concretion of the earth.<pb n="4143" /></p><p>Truffles generally grow in dry, sandy soils, and spots thatare thickly covered with shrubs; in size they are often largerthan a quince, and are found to weigh as much<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> as a pound.There are two kinds of them, the one full of sand, and consequently injurious to the teeth, the other free from sand andall impurities. They are distinguished also by their colour,which is red or black, and white within; those of Africa<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>are the most esteemed. Whether the truffle grows gradually,or whether this blemish of the earth—for it can be looked uponas nothing else—at once assumes the globular form and magnitude which it presents when found; whether, too, it is possessed of vitality or not, are all of them questions, which, inmy opinion, are not easy to be solved. It decays and rots ina manner precisely similar to wood.</p><p>It is known to me as a fact, that the following circumstancehappened to Lartius Licinius, a person of prætorian rank, whileminister of justice,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> a few years ago, at Carthage in Spain;upon biting a truffle, he found a denarius inside, which all butbroke his fore teeth—an evident proof that the truffle is nothing else but an agglomeration of elementary earth. At allevents, it is quite certain that the truffle belongs to thosevegetable productions which spring up spontaneously, and areincapable of being reproduced from seed.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Tuber." The Tuber cibarium of Linnæus, the black truffle; andprobably the grey truffle, the Tuber griseum.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This callous secretion of the earth, or corticle, is, as Fée says, a sortof hymenium, formed of vesicles, which, as they develope themselves, arefound to contain diminutive truffles. Pliny is wrong in saying that thetruffle forms neither cleft nor protuberance, as the exact contrary is thefact.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Haller speaks of truffles weighing as much as fourteen pounds.Valmont de Bomare speaks of a truffle commonly found in Savoy, whichattains the weight of a pound.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Those of Africa are in general similar to those found in Europe, butthere is one peculiar to that country, possibly the same that is mentionedin the following Chapter under the name of "misy."</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Jura reddenti."</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is really propagated by spores, included in sinuous chambers inthe interior; but, notwithstanding the attempts that have been made, ithas never yet been cultivated with any degree of success. In c. 13, Plinyseems to recognize the possibility of its multiplication by germs, where hesays that its formation is attributed by some to water.</p></body>
