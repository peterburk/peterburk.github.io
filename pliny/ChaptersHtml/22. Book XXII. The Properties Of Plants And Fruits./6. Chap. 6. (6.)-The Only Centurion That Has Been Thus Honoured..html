(6.)ÑTHE ONLY CENTURION THAT HAS BEEN THUS HONOURED.</head><p>In addition to the persons already mentioned, the honourof this crown has been awarded to M. Calpurnius Flamma,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>then a military tribune in Sicily; but up to the present timeit has been given to a single centurion only, Cneius PetreiusAtinas, during the war with the Cimbri. This soldier, whileacting as primipilus<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> under Catulus, on finding all retreat forhis legion cut off by the enemy, harangued the troops, andafter slaying his tribune who hesitated to cut a way through theencampment of the enemy, brought away the legion in safety.I find it stated also by some authors, that, in addition to thishonour, this same Petreius, clad in the pr¾texta, offered sacrifice at the altar, to the sound of the pipe,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> in presence of thethen consuls,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> Marius and Catulus.</p><p>The Dictator Sylla has also stated in his memoirs, that whenlegatus in the Marsic War he was presented with this crownby the army, at Nola; an event which he caused to be com-memorated in a painting at his Tusculan villa, which afterwards became the property of Cicero. If there is any truthin this statement, I can only say that it renders his memoryall the more execrable, and that, by his proscriptions, with hisown hand he tore this crown from his brow, for few indeedwere the citizens whom he thus preserved, in comparison withthose he slaughtered at a later period. And let him even addto this high honour his proud surname of "Felix,"<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> if he will;all the glories of this crown he surrendered to Sertorius, fromthe moment that he put his proscribed fellow-citizens in astage of siege throughout the whole world.</p><p>Varro, too, relates that Scipio ®milianus was awarded theobsidional crown in Africa, under the consul Manilius,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> for thepreservation of three cohorts, by bringing as many to theirrescue; an event commemorated by an inscription upon thebase of the statue erected in honour of him by the now deifiedEmperor Augustus, in the Forum which bears his name. Au-<pb n="4395" />gustus himself was also presented by the senate with the obsidional crown, upon the ides<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> of September, in the consulship<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>of M. Cicero the Younger, the civic crown being looked uponas not commensurate with his deserts. Beyond these, I do notfind any one mentioned as having been rewarded with thishonour.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See Livy, B. xxii.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">the primipilus was the first centurion of the first maniple of thetriarii; also called "primus centurionum."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Ad tibicinem."</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A.U.C. 652.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The "Fortunate."</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A.U.C. 605.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">13th of September.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A.U.C. 723.</p></body>
