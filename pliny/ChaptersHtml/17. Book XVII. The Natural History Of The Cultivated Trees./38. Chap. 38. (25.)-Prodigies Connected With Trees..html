<div2 type="chapter" n="38" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 38. (25.)ÑPRODIGIES CONNECTED WITH TREES.</head><p>Among the maladies which affect the various trees, we mayfind room for portentous prodigies also. For we find sometrees that have never had a leaf upon them; a vine and a pome-granate bearing<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> fruit adhering to the trunk, and not uponthe shoots or branches; a vine, too, that bore grapes but hadno leaves; and olives that have lost their leaves while the fruitremained upon the tree. There are some marvels also connectedwith trees that are owing to accident; an olive that was completely burnt, has been known to revive, and in BÏotia, somefig-trees that had been quite eaten away by locusts buddedafresh.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> Trees, too, sometimes change their colour, and turnfrom black to white; this, however, must not always be lookedupon as portentous, and more particularly in the case of thosewhich are grown from seed; the white poplar, too, often becomesblack. Some persons are of opinion also that the service-tree,if transplanted to a warmer locality, will become barren. Butit is a prodigy, no doubt, when sweet fruits become sour, orsour fruits sweet; and when the wild fig becomes changedinto the cultivated one, or vice versa. It is sadly portentous,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>too, when the tree becomes deteriorated by the change, thecultivated olive changing into the wild, and the white grapeor fig becoming black: such was the case, also, when upon thearrival of Xerxes there, a plane-tree at Laodicea was trans-<pb n="3527" />formed into an olive. In such narratives as these, the bookwritten in Greek by Aristander abounds, not to enter any further on so extended a subject; and we have in Latin the Commentaries of C. Epidius, in which we find it stated that treeshave even been known to speak. In the territory of Cum¾, a tree,and a very ominous presage it was, sank into the earth shortlybefore the civil wars of Pompeius Magnus began, leaving onlya few of the branches protruding from the ground. The Sibylline Books were accordingly consulted, and it was found thata war of extermination was impending, which would be attended with greater carnage the nearer it should approach thecity of Rome.</p><p>Another kind of prodigy, too, is the springing up of a treein some extraordinary and unusual place, the head of a statue,for instance, or an altar, or upon another tree even.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> A fig-tree shot forth from a laurel at Cyzicus, just before the siegeof that city; and so in like manner, at Tralles, a palm issuedfrom the pedestal of the statue of the Dictator C¾sar, at theperiod of his civil wars. So, too, at Rome, in the Capitolthere, in the time of the wars against Perseus, a palm-treegrew from the head of the statue of Jupiter, a presage of impending victory and triumphs. This palm, however, havingbeen destroyed by a tempest, a fig-tree sprang up in the verysame place, at the period of the lustration made by the censorsM. Messala and C. Cassius,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> a time at which, according to Piso,an author of high authority, all sense of shame had been utterlybanished. Above all the prodigies, however, that have everbeen heard of, we ought to place the one that was seen in ourown time, at the period of the fall of the Emperor Nero, in theterritory of Marrucinum; a plantation of olives, belonging toVectius Marcellus, one of the principal members of the Equestrian order, bodily crossed the public highway, while the fieldsthat lay on the opposite side of the road passed over to supplythe place which had been thus vacated by the olive-yard.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This, as FŽe remarks, is not by any means impossible, nor, indeed,are any other of the cases mentioned in this paragraph, owing to someaccidental circumstance.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxix. c. 29.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">These stories can, of course, be only regarded as fabulous.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This may easily be accounted for, by the seed accidentally lodging ina crevice of the tree.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A.U.C. 600.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">An exaggerated account merely of a land-slip.</p></body>
