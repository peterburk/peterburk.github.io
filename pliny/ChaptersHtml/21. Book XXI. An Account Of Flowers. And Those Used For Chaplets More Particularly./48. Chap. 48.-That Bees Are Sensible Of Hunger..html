In certain summers, too, when long-con-tinued drought has deprived them of the nutriment whichthey usually derive from flowers, similar food must be provided for them.</p><p>When the honey is taken, the outlets of the hive should bewell rubbed with melissophyllum or broom,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> beaten up, or elsethe middle of it should be encircled with bands of white vine,to prevent the bees from taking to flight. It is recommended,too, that the honey-pots and combs should be washed withwater: this water, boiled, it is said, will make an extremelywholesome vinegar.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Honeycombs and rough wax are placed in the hive, when the beesare in want of aliment; also honey and sugar-sirop.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Defrutum:" grape-juice boiled down to one-half.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Fée is at a loss to know how this could be of any service as an ali-ment to bees.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A mere puerility, Fée says.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">But extremely weak, no doubt; for after boiling, the hydromel mustbe subjected, first to vinous, and then to acetous, fermentation.</p></body>
