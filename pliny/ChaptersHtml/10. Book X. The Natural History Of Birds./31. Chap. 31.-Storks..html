There can be no doubt but that, like the cranes,they come from a very great distance, the cranes being ourwinter, the storks our summer, guests. When about to taketheir departure, the storks assemble at a stated place, and areparticularly careful that all shall attend, so that not one oftheir kind may be left behind, with the exception of such asmay be in captivity or tamed; and then on a certain day theyset out, as though by some law they were directed to do so. Noone has ever yet seen a flight of cranes taking their departure,although they have been often observed preparing to depart;and in the same way, too, we never see them arrive, but onlywhen they have arrived; both their departure as well as theirarrival take place in the night. Although, too, we see themflying about in all directions, it is still supposed that theynever arrive at any other time but in the night. Pythonos-come<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> is the name given to some vast plains of Asia, where,as they assemble together, they keep up a gabbling noise, andtear to pieces the one that happens to arrive the last; afterwhich they take their departure. It has been remarked thatafter the ides of August,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> they are never by any accident to beseen there.</p><p>There are some writers who assure us that the stork has notongue. So highly are they esteemed for their utility in destroying serpents, that in Thessaly, it was a capital crime forany one to kill a stork, and by the laws the same penalty wasinflicted for it as for homicide.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The "village of the Python," or "serpent."
