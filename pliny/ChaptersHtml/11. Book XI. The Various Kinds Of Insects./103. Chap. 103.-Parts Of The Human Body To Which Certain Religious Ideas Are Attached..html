It is theknees that suppliants clasp, and it is to these that they extendtheir hands; it is the knees that they worship like so manyaltars, as it were; perhaps, because in them is centred thevital strength. For in the joint of either knee, the rightas well as the left, there is on the fore-side of each a certainempty space, which bears a strong resemblance to a mouth, andthrough which, like the throat, if it is once pierced, the vitalpowers escape.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> There are also certain religious ideas attached to other parts of the body, as is testified in raising theback of the right hand to the lips, and extending it as a tokenof good faith. It was the custom of the ancient Greeks, whenin the act of supplication, to touch the chin. The seat of thememory lies in the lower part of the ear, which we touchwhen we summon a witness to depose upon memory to anarrest.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> The seat, too, of Nemesis<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> lies behind the right ear, agoddess which has never yet found a Latin name, no, not in theCapitol even. It is to this part that we apply the finger nextthe little finger, after touching the mouth with it, when wesilently ask pardon of the gods for having let slip an indiscreetword.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Though wounds in the knee are highly dangerous, death does not <hi rend="ital">ne-</hi><hi rend="ital">cessarily</hi> ensue.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Of another person, who had thus forfeited his bail.
