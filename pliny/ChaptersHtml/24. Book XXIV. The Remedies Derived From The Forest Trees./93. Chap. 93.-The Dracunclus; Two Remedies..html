<div2 type="chapter" n="93" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 93.ÑTHE DRACUNCLUS; TWO REMEDIES.</head><p>The plant which I have spoken of<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> as the dracunculus, istaken out of the ground just when the barley is ripening, andat the moon's increase. It is quite sufficient to have thisplant about one, to be safe from all serpents; and it is said,that an infusion of the larger kind taken in drink, is very usefulfor persons who have been stung by those reptiles: it is statedalso that it arrests the catamenia when in excess, due care beingtaken not to let iron touch it. The juice of it too is very useful for pains in the ears.</p><p>As to the plant known to the Greeks by the name of "dracontion," I have<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> had it pointed out to me under three dif-ferent forms; the first<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> having the leaves of the beet, with acertain proportion of stem, and a purple flower, and bearinga strong resemblance to the aron. Other persons, again, havedescribed it as a plant<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> with a long root, embossed to all appearance and full of knots, and consisting of three stems in all;the same parties have recommended a decoction of the leavesin vinegar, as curative of stings inflicted by serpents. Thethird<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> plant that has been pointed out to me has a leaf largerthan that of the cornel, and a root resembling that of the reed.This root, I have been assured, has as many knots on it as theplant is years old, the leaves, too, being as many in number.The plant is recommended also for the stings of serpents,administered either in wine or in water.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In c. 91 of this Book.
