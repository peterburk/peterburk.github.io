(40.)ÑSUPREME HAPPINESS.</head><p>Of all nations of the earth, the Romans have, without doubt,excelled every other in the display of valour.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> The humanjudgment cannot, however, possibly decide what man has enjoyed the highest degree of happiness, seeing that every onedefines a state of prosperity in a way different from another,and entirely in conformity with his own notions. If we wishto form a true judgment and come to a decision, casting asideall the allurements and illusions of fortune, we are bound tosay that no mortal is happy. Fortune has dealt well, and, indeed, indulgently, to him who feels that he has a right to saythat he is not unhappy. For if there is nothing else, at allevents, there is the fear lest fortune should fail at last; whichfear itself, when it has once fastened upon us, our happiness isno longer unalloyed. And then, too, is it not the case that thereis no mortal who is always wise? Would that there were<pb n="2187" />many to be found, who could feel a conviction that this is false,and that it had not been enunciated by an oracle itself, as itwere! Mortals, vain as they are, and ingenious in deceivingthemselves, calculate in the same way as the Thracians, who,according to their experience of each day, deposit in an urna black or a white pebble; at the close of their life, thesepebbles are separated, and from the relative number of eachkind, they form their conclusions.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> But really, may not thatvery day that has been complimented with a white pebble, havecontained in itself the germ of some misfortune? How manya man has got into trouble by the very power which has beenbestowed upon him? How many have been brought to ruinand plunged into the deepest misery by their own blessings? orrather, by what have been looked upon too fondly as blessings,for the hour during which they were in the full enjoyment ofthem. But most true it is, that it is the day after, that is thejudge of the day before; and after all, it is only the last daythat is to set its stamp on the whole; the consequence is,that we can put our trust in none of them. And then, too,is it not the fact that the blessings of life would not be equalto its evils, even though they were equal in number? Forwhat pleasure is there that can compensate for the slightestgrief? Alas! what a vain and unreasonable task we imposeupon ourselves! We trouble ourselves with counting the<hi rend="ital">number</hi> of days, when it is their <hi rend="ital">weight</hi><span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> that ought to betaken into consideration.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Virtus"Ñ"manliness," that being esteemed by the Romans theideal of true virtue.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It appears that a similar custom prevailed among the Scythians, according to Phylarchus, from whom Pliny probably took his account of it;Lemaire, vol. iii. p. 151.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">As being fraught with an intensity of pain, which no number of dayspassed in pleasure can compensate.</p></body>
