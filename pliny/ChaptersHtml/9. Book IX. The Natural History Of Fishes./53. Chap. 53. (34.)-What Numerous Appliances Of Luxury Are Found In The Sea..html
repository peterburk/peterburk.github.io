<div2 type="chapter" n="53" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 53. (34.)—WHAT NUMEROUS APPLIANCES OF LUXURY ARE FOUND IN THE SEA.</head><p>But why mention such trifles as these, when I am sensiblethat no greater inroads have been made upon our morals, andno more rapid advances have been made by luxury, thanthose effected through the medium of shell-fish? Of all theelements that exist, the sea is the one that costs the dearestto the belly; seeing that it provides so many kinds of meats,<pb n="2430" />so many dishes, so many exquisite flavours derived from fish,all of which are valued in proportion to the danger undergoneby those who have caught them.</p><p>(35.) But still, how insignificant is all this when we cometo think of our purple, our azure,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and our pearls; it was notenough, forsooth, for the spoils of the sea to be thrust downthe gullet—But they must be employed as well to adorn thehands, the ears, the head, the whole body, in fact, and thatof the men pretty nearly as much as the women. What hasthe sea to do with our clothes?<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> What is there in com-mon between waves and billows and a sheep's fleece? Thisone element ought not to receive us, according to ordinarynotions, except in a state of nakedness. Let there be everso strong an alliance between it and the belly, on the score ofgluttony, still, what can it possibly have to do with theback? It is not enough, forsooth, that we are fed upon whatis acquired by perils, but we must be clothed, too, in a similarway; so true it is, that for all the wants of the body, thatwhich is sought at the expense of human life, is sure toplease us the most.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ajasson says, that the words "purpuras, conchylia," here signify notthe fish themselves, but the various tints produced by them; the purpuraand the conchylium being, in fact, exactly the same fish, though, as will beexplained in c. 60 of the present Book, by various modes of treatment,various colours were extracted from them. See also B. xxi. c. 22.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Dalechamps notices here an ancient proverb, which says, "Qui narevult, se exuit."
