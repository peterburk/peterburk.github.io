The flower of Jove ispleasing only for its colours, being quite inodorous; which isthe case also with the plant known by the Greek name of"phlox."<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> All the plants, too, which we have just mentionedare odoriferous, both in the branches and the leaves, with thesole exception of wild thyme.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> The helenium is said to have<pb n="4334" />had its origin in the tears of Helen, and hence it is that thekind grown in the island of Helena<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> is so highly esteemed. Itis a shrub which throws out its tiny branches along the ground,some nine inches in length, with a leaf very similar to that ofwild thyme.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Supposed to be the same as the Agrostemma coronaria of Linnæus.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Sprengel identifies it with the Pancratium maritimum of Linnæus.As described by Dioscorides, however, Fée takes it to be theLilium Martagon, or Turk's-cap lily.
