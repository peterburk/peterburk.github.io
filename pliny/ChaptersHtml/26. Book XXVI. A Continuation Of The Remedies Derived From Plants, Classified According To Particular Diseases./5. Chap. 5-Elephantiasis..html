<div2 type="chapter" n="5" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 5—ELEPHANTIASIS.</head><p>We have already<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> stated that elephantiasis<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> was unknown<pb n="5155" />in Italy before the time of Pompeius Magnus. This malady,too, like those already mentioned, mostly makes its first appearance in the face. In its primary form it bears a considerable resemblance to a small lentil upon the nose; the skingradually dries up all over the body, is marked with spots ofvarious colours, and presents an unequal surface, being thickin one place, thin in another, indurated every here and there,and covered with a sort of rough scab. At a later period, theskin assumes a black hue, and compresses the flesh upon thebones, the fingers and toes becoming swollen.</p><p>This disease was originally peculiar to Egypt. Whenever itattacked the kings of that country, it was attended with peculiarly fatal effects to the people, it being the practice totemper their sitting-baths with human blood, for the treatmentof the disease. As for Italy, however, its career was verysoon cut short: the same was the case, too, with the diseaseknown as "gemursa" Fée thinks that this may have been a sort of abscess similar to thosebetween the fingers which are known as <hi rend="ital">fourches</hi> by the French, and bymedical men as "Aposthema phalangum." Gruner considers it to be a sortof Elephantiasis, and Triller identifies it with the disease called <hi rend="ital">Gumretha</hi>by the Talmudists. to the ancients, a malady which madeits appearance between the toes, and the very name of which isnow buried in oblivion.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. xx. c. 52.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Supposed, as Pliny says, to have originally come from Upper Egypt.Lucretius, B. vi. 1. 1111, <hi rend="ital">et seq.,</hi> attributes it to the water of the Nile.
