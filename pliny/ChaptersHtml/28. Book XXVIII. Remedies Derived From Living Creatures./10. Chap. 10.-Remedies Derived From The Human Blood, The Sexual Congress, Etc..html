Some say that, forepilepsy, the great toes should be pricked, and the drops ofblood that exude therefrom applied to the face; or else, that avirgin should touch the patient with her right thumb—a cir-cumstance that has led to the belief that persons suffering fromepilepsy should eat the flesh of animals in a virgin state.Æschines of Athens used to cure quinzy, carcinoma, and affec-tions of the tonsillary glands and uvula, with the ashes ofburnt excrements, a medicament to which he gave the nameof "botryon."<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>There are many kinds of diseases which disappear entirelyafter the first sexual congress,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> or, in the case of females, at thefirst appearance of menstruation; indeed, if such is not thecase, they are apt to become chronic, epilepsy in particular.Even more than this-a man, it is said, who has been stungby a serpent or scorpion, experiences relief from the sexualcongress; but the woman, on the other hand, is sensible ofdetriment. We are assured, too, that if persons, when washingtheir feet, touch the eyes three times with the water, they willnever be subject to ophthalmia or other diseases of the eyes.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Properly meaning "a cluster of grapes."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ajasson remarks that there is a considerable degree of truth in thisassertion.
