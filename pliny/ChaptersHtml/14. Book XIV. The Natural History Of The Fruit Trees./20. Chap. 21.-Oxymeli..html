To this mixture the nameof oxymeli has been given; it is compounded of ten pounds ofhoney, five semi-sextarii of old vinegar, one pound of sea-salt,and five sextarii of rain-water. This is boiled gently till themixture has bubbled in the pot some ten times,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> after which itis drawn off, and kept till it is old;<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> all these wines, however, are condemned<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> by Themison, an author of high authority.

However, allthese particulars, when known, are curious and interesting,and show how successfully the human intellect has pried intoevery secret.<pb n="3262" /></p><p>None of these wines, however, will keep beyond a year,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>with the sole exception of those which we have spoken of asrequiring age; many of these, indeed, there can be no doubt,do not improve after being kept so little as thirty days.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxiii. c. 9.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Subfervefactis."
