(2.)—THE NATURE OF SPARTUM.</head><p>For the fact is that spartum<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> did not begin to be employed<pb n="4140" />till many ages after the time of Homer; indeed, not before thefirst war that the Carthaginians waged in Spain. This, too,is a plant that grows spontaneously,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and is incapable of beingreproduced by sowing, it being a species of rush, peculiar to adry, arid soil, a morbid production confined to a single countryonly; for in reality it is a curse to the soil, as there is nothingwhatever that can be sown or grown in its vicinity. There isa kind of spartum grown in Africa,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> of a stunted nature, andquite useless for all practical purposes. It is found in oneportion of the province of Carthage<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> in Nearer Spain, thoughnot in every part of that; but wherever it is produced, themountains, even, are covered all over with it.</p><p>This material is employed by the country-people there formaking<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> their beds; with it they kindle their fires also, andprepare their torches; shoes<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> also, and garments for the shepherds, are made of it. As a food for animals, it is highly injurious,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> with the sole exception of the tender tops of theshoots. When wanted for other uses, it is pulled up by theroots, with considerable labour; the legs of the persons so employed being protected by boots, and their hands with gloves,the plant being twisted round levers of bone or holm-oak, toget it up with the greater facility. At the present day it isgathered in the winter, even; but this work is done with theleast difficulty between the ides of May<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> and those of June,that being the period at which it is perfectly ripe.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Stipa tenacissima of Linnæus; a kind of broom, called "Esparto"by the Spaniards.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Although, as Fée says, this is still the fact, it is a plant which wouldreadily admit of cultivation.
