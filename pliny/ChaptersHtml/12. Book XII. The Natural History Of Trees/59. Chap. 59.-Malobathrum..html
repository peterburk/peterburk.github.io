Fromthis plant an oil is extracted for unguents. Egypt produces itin still greater abundance; but that which is the most esteemedof all comes from India, where it is said to grow in the marsheslike the lentil. It has a more powerful odour than saffron,and has a black, rough appearance, with a sort of brackishtaste. The white is the least approved of all, and it very soonturns musty when old. In taste it ought to be similar tonard, when placed under the tongue. When made luke-warmin wine, the odour which it emits is superior to any other.The prices at which this drug ranges are something quitemarvellous, being from one denarius to four hundred per pound;as for the leaf, it generally sells at sixty denarii per pound.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Some suppose this tree to be the Laurus cassia of Linn¾us, or wildcinnamon; others take it for the betel, the Piper betel of Linn¾us. Clusius thinks that the name is derived from the Indian Tamalpatra, the namegiven from time immemorial to the leaf of a tree known by the Arabs asthe Cadegi-indi, possibly the same as the Katou-carua of the Malabars.</p></body>
