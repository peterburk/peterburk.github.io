<div2 type="chapter" n="21" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 21.—THE NATIONS OF INDIA.</head><p>But we come now to nations as to which there is a more general agreement among writers. Where the chain of Emodus<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>rises, the nations of India begin, which borders not only on theEastern sea, but on the Southern as well, which we have already mentioned<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> as being called the Indian Ocean. Thatpart which faces the east runs in a straight line a distance ofeighteen hundred and seventy-five miles until it comes to abend, at which the Indian Ocean begins. Here it takes a turnto the south, and continues to run in that direction a distanceof two thousand four hundred and seventy-five miles, according to Eratosthenes, as far as the river Indus, the boundaryof India on the west.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> Many authors have represented theentire length of the Indian coast as being forty days' andnights' sail, and as being, from north to south, two thousandeight hundred and fifty miles. Agrippa states its length to bethree thousand three hundred miles, and its breadth, two thousand three hundred. Posidonius has given its measurement aslying from north-east to south-east, placing it opposite to Gaul,of which country he has given the measurement as lyingfrom north-west to south-west; making the whole of Indiato lie due west of Gaul. Hence, as he has shewn by undoubted proofs, India lying opposite to Gaul must be refreshed<pb n="2039" />by the blowing of that wind,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and derive its salubrity there-from.</p><p>In this region, the appearance of the heavens is totallychanged, and quite different is the rising of the stars; thereare two summers in the year, and two harvests, while the winterintervenes between them during the time that the Etesian<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>winds are blowing: during our winter too, they enjoy lightbreezes, and their seas are navigable. In this country there arenations and cities which would be found to be quite innumerable,if a person should attempt to enumerate them. For it has beenexplored not only by the arms of Alexander the Great and of thekings who succeeded him, by Seleucus and Antiochus, whosailed round even to the Caspian and Hyrcanian Sea, and byPatrocles,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> the admiral of their fleet, but has been treated of byseveral other Greek writers who resided at the courts of Indiankings, such, for instance, as Megasthenes, and by Dionysius,who was sent thither by Philadelphus, expressly for the purpose:all of whom have enlarged upon the power and vast resourcesof these nations. Still, however, there is no possibility ofbeing rigorously exact, so different are the accounts given, andoften of a nature so incredible. The followers of Alexanderthe Great have stated in their writings, that there were no lessthan five thousand cities in that portion of India which they<pb n="2040" />vanquished by force of arms, not one of which was smaller thanthat of Cos;<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> that its nations were eight in number, that Indiaforms one-third of the whole earth, and that its populationsare innumerable—a thing which is certainly far from improbable, seeing that the Indians are nearly the only race of peoplewho have never migrated from their own territories. Fromthe time of Father Liber<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> to that of Alexander the Great, onehundred and fifty-three kings of India are reckoned, extendingover a period of six thousand four hundred and fifty-one yearsand three months. The vast extent of their rivers is quitemarvellous; it is stated that on no one day did Alexander theGreat sail less than six hundred stadia<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> on the Indus, and stillwas unable to reach its mouth in less than five months andsome few days: and yet it is a well-known fact that thisriver is not so large as the Ganges.<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> Seneca, one of our fellow-countrymen, who has written a treatise<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> upon the subject ofIndia, has given its rivers as sixty-five in number, and itsnations as one hundred and eighteen. The difficulty too wouldbe quite as great, if we were to attempt to enumerate its mountains. The chains of Emaüs, of Emodus, of Paropanisus,and of Caucasus, are all connected, the one with the other;and from their foot, the country of India runs down in theform of a vast plain, bearing a very considerable resemblance tothat of Egypt.</p><p>However, that we may come to a better understanding relative to the description of these regions, we will follow inthe track of Alexander the Great. Diognetus and Bæton, whoseduty it was to ascertain the distances and length of hisexpeditions, have written that from the Caspian Gates toHecatompylon, the city of the Parthians, the distance is thenumber of miles which we have already<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> stated; and that fromthence to Alexandria,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> of the Arii, which city was founded by thesame king, the distance is five hundred and seventy-five miles;from thence to Prophthasia,<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> the city of the Drangæ, one<pb n="2041" />hundred and ninety-nine; from thence to the city of theArachosii,<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> five hundred and sixty-five; from thence toOrtospanum,<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> one hundred and seventy-five; and fromthence to the city built by Alexander,<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> fifty, miles. In somecopies, however, the numbers are found differently stated;and we find this last city even placed at the very foot ofMount Caucasus! From this place to the river Cophes<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> andPeucolaitis, a city of India, is two hundred and thirty-sevenmiles; from thence to the river Indus and the city of Taxilla<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> sixty; from thence to the famous river Hydaspes<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> onehundred and twenty; and from thence to the Hypasis,<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> ariver no less famous, two hundred and ninety miles, and threehundred and ninety paces. This last was the extreme limitof the expedition of Alexander, though he crossed the riverand dedicated certain altars<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> on the opposite side. The dispatches written by order of that king fully agree with thedistances above stated.</p><p>The remaining distances beyond the above point were ascertained on the expedition of Seleucus Nicator. They are,to the river Sydrus,<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span> one hundred and sixty-eight miles; tothe river Jomanes, the same; some copies, however, add<pb n="2042" />to this last distance five miles; thence to the Ganges, onehundred and twelve miles; to Rhodapha, five hundred andsixty-nine—though, according to some writers, this last distance is only three hundred and twenty-five miles; to the townof Calinipaxa,<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span> one hundred and sixty-seven, according tosome, two hundred and sixty-five; thence to the confluenceof the river Jomanes<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span> and Ganges, six hundred and twenty-five; most writers, however, add thirteen miles to this lastdistance; thence to the city of Palibothra,<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span> four hundred andtwenty-five—and thence to the mouth of the Ganges, six hundred and thirty-seven miles and a half.</p><p>The nations whom it may be not altogether inopportune tomention, after passing the Emodian Mountains, a cross range ofwhich is called "Imaus," a word which, in the language of thenatives, signifies "snowy,"<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span> are the Isari, the Cosyri, the Izi,and, upon the chain of mountains, the Chisiotosagi, with numerous peoples, which have the surname of Brachmanæ,<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span>among whom are the Maccocalingæ. There are also therivers Prinas and Cainas,<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span> which last flows into the Ganges,both of them navigable streams. The nation of the Calingæ<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span><pb n="2043" />comes nearest to the sea, and above them are the Mandei andthe Malli.<span id="ref_31"><a href="#note_31">[31]</a></span> In the territory of the last-named people is amountain called Mallus: the boundary of this region is theriver Ganges.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Emodi Montes (so called probably from the Indian <hi rend="ital">hemâdri,</hi> orthe "golden") are supposed to have formed that portion of the greatlateral branch of the Indian Caucasus, the range of the Himalaya, whichextends along Nepaul, and probably as far as Bhotan.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In c. 14 of the present Book.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The whole of this passage seems very intricate, and it is difficult tomake sense of it. His meaning, however, is probably this: that thecoast of India, running from extreme north-east to south-east, relatively toGreece, the country of Eratosthenes, is exactly opposite to the coast ofGaul, running from extreme north-west to south-west—India thus lyingdue west of Gaul, without any intervening land. This, it will be remembered, was the notion of Columbus, when contemplating the possibility ofa western passage to India.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This appears also to be somewhat obscure. It is clear that if Indialies to the west of Gaul, it cannot be Pliny's meaning that it is refreshedby the <hi rend="ital">west</hi> wind blowing <hi rend="ital">to it from</hi> Gaul. He may possibly mean thatthe west wind, which is so refreshing to the west of Europe, and Gaul inparticular, first sweeps over India, and thus becomes productive of thatsalubrity which Posidonius seems to have discovered in India, but forwhich we look in vain at the present day. Amid, however, such multipliedchances of a corrupt text, it is impossible to assume any very definite position as to his probable meaning. The French translators offer no assistance in solving the difficulty, and Holland renders it, "This west windwhich <hi rend="ital">from behind</hi> Gaul bloweth upon India, is very healthsome," &amp;c.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">As to the Etesian winds, see 1. ii. c. 48.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In the geographical work which Patrocles seems to have published,he is supposed to have given some account of the countries bordering on theCaspian Sea, and there is little doubt that, like other writers of that period,he regarded that sea as a gulf or inlet of the Septentrional Ocean, and probably maintained the possibility of sailing thither by sea from the IndianOcean. This statement, however, seems to have been strangely misinterpreted by Pliny in his present assertion, that Patrocles had himself accomplished this circumnavigation.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. v. c. 36.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or Bacchus.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or seventy-five miles.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is the statement of Arrian.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Among the lost works of that philosopher.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In c. 17 of the present Book.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See c. 25 of the present Book.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See c. 25 of the present Book.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See c. 25 of the present Book.</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A town placed by Strabo on the confines of Bactriana, and by Ptolemyin the county of the Paropanisidæ.</p><p><span id="note_17"><a href="#ref_17">17. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See c. 25 of the present Book.</p><p><span id="note_18"><a href="#ref_18">18. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See c. 24 of the present Book.</p><p><span id="note_19"><a href="#ref_19">19. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The present Attok, according to D'Anville.</p><p><span id="note_20"><a href="#ref_20">20. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">One of the principal rivers of that part of India known as the Punjaub.

It is pretty clear, that,like Ptolemy, Pliny imagined that the Imaiis ran from south to north; butit seems hardly necessary, in this instance at least, to give to the word"promontorium" the meaning attached to our word "promontory," andto suppose that he implies that the range of the Imaüs runs down to theverge of the eastern ocean.</p><p><span id="note_28"><a href="#ref_28">28. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A name evidently given to numerous tribes of India, from the circumstance that Alexander and his followers found it borne by the Brahminsor priestly caste of the Hindoos.</p><p><span id="note_29"><a href="#ref_29">29. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Still called the Cane, a navigable river of India within the Ganges,falling into the Ganges, according to Arrian as well as Pliny, though inreality it falls into the Jumna.</p><p><span id="note_30"><a href="#ref_30">30. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Calingæ, who are further mentioned in the next Chapter, probablydwelt in the vicinity of the promontory of Calingon, upon which was thetown of Dandaguda, mentioned in c. 23 of the present Book.
