The bones ofthe head are flat, thin, devoid of marrow, and united with sutures indented like a comb. When broken asunder they cannot be united, but the extraction of a small portion is not necessarily fatal, as a fleshy cicatrix forms, and so makes goodthe loss. We have already mentioned, in their respective<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>places, that the skull of the bear is the weakest of all, andthat of the parrot the hardest.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">B. viii. c. 54, and B. x. c. 58. The skull of the bear is not thinneror weaker than that of other animals of its own size; but the skull of theparrot, in proportion to those of other birds, is remarkably hard.</p></body>
