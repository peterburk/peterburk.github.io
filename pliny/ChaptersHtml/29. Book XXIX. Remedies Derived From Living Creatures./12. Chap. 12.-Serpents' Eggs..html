<div2 type="chapter" n="12" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 12.—SERPENTS' EGGS.</head><p>In addition to the above, there is another kind of egg,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> held<pb n="5389" />in high renown by the people of the Gallic provinces, buttotally omitted by the Greek writers. In summer<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> time, numberless snakes become artificially entwined together, and formrings around their bodies with the viscous slime which exudesfrom their mouths, and with the foam secreted by them: thename given to this substance is "anguinum."<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> The Druidstell us, that the serpents eject these eggs into the air by theirhissing,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and that a person must be ready to catch them in acloak, so as not to let them touch the ground; they say also that hemust instantly take to flight on horseback, as the serpents willbe sure to pursue him, until some intervening river has placeda barrier between them. The test of its genuineness, they say,is its floating against the current of a stream, even though itbe set in gold. But, as it is the way with magicians to bedexterous and cunning in casting a veil about their frauds, theypretend that these eggs can only be taken on a certain day ofthe moon; as though, forsooth, it depended entirely upon thehuman will to make the moon and the serpents accord as tothe moment of this operation.</p><p>I myself, however, have seen one of these eggs: it wasround, and about as large as an apple of moderate size; theshell<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> of it was formed of a cartilaginous substance, and it wassurrounded with numerous cupules, as it were, resemblingthose upon the arms of the polypus: it is held in high estimation<pb n="5390" />among the Druids. The possession of it is marvellously vauntedas ensuring success<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> in law-suits, and a favourable receptionwith princes; a notion which has been so far belied, that aRoman of equestrian rank, a native of the territory of theVocontii,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> who, during a trial, had one of these eggs in hisbosom, was slain by the late Emperor Tiberius, and for noother reason, that I know of, but because he was in possessionof it. It is this entwining of serpents with one another, andthe fruitful results of this unison, that seem to me to havegiven rise to the usage among foreign nations, of surroundingthe caduceus<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> with representations of serpents, as so manysymbols of peace-it must be remembered, too, that on thecaduceus, serpents are never<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> represented as having crests.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny alludes here to the beads or rings of glass which were used bythe Druids as charms to impose on the credulity of their devotees, underthe name of <hi rend="ital">Glain naidr,</hi> or "the Adder gem." Mr. Luyd (in Rowland'sMona Antiqua, p. 342) says that the genuine <hi rend="ital">Ovum anguinum</hi> can be noother than a shell of the kind called <hi rend="ital">echinus marinus,</hi> and that Dr. Borlaseobserves that, instead of the natural <hi rend="ital">anguinum,</hi> artificial rings of stone,glass, and sometimes baked clay, were substituted as of equal validity.The belief in these charms very recently existed in Cornwall and Wales, ifindeed it does not at the present day. The subject is very fully discussed inBrand's <hi rend="ital">Popular Antiquities,</hi> Vol. III. p. 286, <hi rend="ital">et seq.,</hi> and p. 369, <hi rend="ital">et seq.,</hi><hi rend="ital">Bohn's Edition.</hi> These gems and beads are not uncommonly found in tumuliof the early British period.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A similar belief in its origin was prevalent in Cornwall and Wales,and whoever found it was supposed to ensure success in all his undertakings.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"The snake's <hi rend="ital">egg"–ovum</hi> being understood.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"The vulgar opinion in Cornwall and most parts of Wales is that theseare produced through all Cornwall by snakes joining their heads togetherand hissing, which forms a kind of bubble like a ring about the head ofone of them, which the rest, by continual hissing, blow on till it comes offat the tail, when it immediately hardens and resembles a glass ring."—<hi rend="ital">Gough's Camden,</hi> Vol. II. p. 571, Ed. <date value="1789" authname="1789">1789</date>.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The shell of a sea urchin most probably.
