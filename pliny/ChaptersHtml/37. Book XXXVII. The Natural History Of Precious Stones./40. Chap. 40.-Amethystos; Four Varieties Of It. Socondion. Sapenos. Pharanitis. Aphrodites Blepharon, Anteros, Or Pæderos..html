<div2 type="chapter" n="40" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 40.ÑAMETHYSTOS; FOUR VARIETIES OF IT. SOCONDION.SAPENOS. PHARANITIS. APHRODITES BLEPHARON, ANTEROS, ORP®DEROS.</head><p>We will now commence with another class of precious stones,<pb n="6433" />those of a purple colour, or whose tints are derived from purple.To the first rank belongs the amethystos<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> of India; a stonewhich is also found in the part of Arabia that adjoins Syriaand is known as Petra, as also in Lesser Armenia, Egypt, andGalatia; the very worst of all, and the least valued, being thoseof Thasos and Cyprus. The name which these stones bear,originates, it is said, in the peculiar tint of their brilliancy,which, after closely approaching the colour of wine, passes offinto a violet without being fully pronounced; or else, accordingto some authorities, in the fact that in their purple thereis something that falls short of a fiery colour, the tints fadingoff and inclining to the colour of wine.</p><p>All these stones are transparent and of an agreeable violetcolour, and are easy<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> to engrave. Those of India have inperfection the very richest shades of purple, and it is to attainthis colour that the dyers<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> in purple direct all their endeavours;it presenting a fine mellowed appearance to the eye, and notdazzling the sight, as in the case with the colours of the carbunculus.Another variety approaches more nearly the hyacinthin colour: the people of India call this tint "socon," and thestone itself "socondion." A third stone of this class is of amore diluted colour, and is known as "sapenos," being identicalwith "pharanitis," so called from a country<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> on thefrontiers of Arabia that produces it. Of a fourth kind, thecolour is like that of wine; and in a fifth it borders very closelyupon that of crystal, the purple gradually passing off intowhite. This last kind is but little valued; for a fine amethystshould always have, when viewed sideways<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> and held up to thelight, a certain purple refulgence, like that of carbunculus,slightly inclining to a tint of rose.</p><p>Some prefer giving these stones the name of "p¾deros"<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> or<pb n="6434" />of "anteros,"<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> while to many they are known as "Venus'<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>eyelid," a name which would seem to be particularly appropriateto the colour and general appearance of the gem. Thefalsehoods of the magicians would persuade us that these stonesare preventive of inebriety, and that it is from this that theyhave derived<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> their name. They tell us also, that if we inscribethe names of the sun and moon upon this stone, and thenwear it suspended from the neck, with some hair of the cynocephalus<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>and feathers of the swallow, it will act as a preservativeagainst all noxious spells. It is said too, that worn in anymanner, this stone will ensure access to the presence of kings;and that it will avert hail and the attacks of locusts, if a certainprayer is also repeated which they mention. They make similarpromises, too, in reference to the smaragdus, if graven with thefigure of an eagle or of a scarab¾us: statements which, in myopinion, they cannot have committed to writing without a feelingof contempt and derision for the rest of mankind.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">So called, according to some authorities, from <foreign lang="greek">a)</foreign>, "not," <foreign lang="greek">mequ/w</foreign>, "tointoxicate," on account of its being a supposed preservative against inebriety.Ajasson is of opinion that Pliny does not here speaks of the Quartz Amethystof modern mineralogy, but only the Oriental Amethyst, violet Sapphire,or violet Corundum.
