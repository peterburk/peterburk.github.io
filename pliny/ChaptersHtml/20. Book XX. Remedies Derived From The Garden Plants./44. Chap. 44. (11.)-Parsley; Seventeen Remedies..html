(11.)—PARSLEY; SEVENTEEN REMEDIES.</head><p>Parsley<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> is held in universal esteem; for we find sprigs ofit swimming in the draughts of milk given us to drink incountry-places; and we know that as a seasoning for sauces, itis looked upon with peculiar favour. Applied to the eyes withhoney, which must also be fomented from time to time with awarm decoction of it, it has a most marvellous efficacy in casesof defluxion of those organs or of other parts of the body; asalso when beaten up and applied by itself, or in combinationwith bread or with polenta. Fish, too, when found to be inan ailing state in the preserves, are greatly refreshed bygiving them green parsley. As to the opinions entertainedupon it among the learned, there is not a single productiondug out of the earth in reference to which a greater diversityexists.<pb n="4247" /></p><p>Parsley is distinguished as male and female:<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> according toChrysippus, the female plant has a hard leaf and more curledthan the other, a thick stem, and an acrid, hot taste. Dionysius says, that the female is darker than the other kind,has a shorter root, and engenders small worms.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> Both ofthese writers, however, agree in saying that neither kind ofparsley should be admitted into the number of our aliments;indeed, they look upon it as nothing less than sacrilege to do so,seeing that parsley is consecrated to the funereal feasts in honourof the dead. They say, too, that it is injurious to the eyesight, that the stalk of the female plant engenders small worms,for which reason it is that those who eat of it become barren—males as well as females; and that children suckled by femaleswho live on a parsley diet, are sure to be epileptic. Theyagree, however, in stating that the male plant is not so injurious in its effects as the female, and that it is for this reasonthat it is not absolutely condemned and classed among the forbidden plants. The leaves of it, employed as a cataplasm, areused for dispersing hard tumours<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> in the mamillæ; and whenboiled in water, it makes it more agreeable to drink. Thejuice of the root more particularly, mixed with wine, allaysthe pains of lumbago, and, injected into the ears, it diminisheshardness of hearing. The seed of it acts as a diuretic, promotes the menstrual discharge, and brings away the afterbirth.</p><p>Bruises and livid spots, if fomented with a decoction ofparsley-seeed, will resume their natural colour. Applied topically, with the white of egg, or boiled in water, and thendrunk, it is remedial for affections of the kidneys; and beatenup in cold water it is a cure for ulcers of the mouth. Theseed, mixed with wine, or the root, taken with old wine, hasthe effect of breaking calculi in the bladder. The seed, too,is given in white wine, to persons afflicted with the jaundice.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is not consistent with fact.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This distinction, Fée says, cannot be admitted.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or maggots.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This belief in its efficacy, Fée says, still exists.</p></body>
