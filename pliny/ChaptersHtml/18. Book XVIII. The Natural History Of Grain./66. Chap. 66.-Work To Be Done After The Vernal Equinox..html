<div2 type="chapter" n="66" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 66.—WORK TO BE DONE AFTER THE VERNAL EQUINOX.</head><p>The vernal equinox appears to end on the eighth<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> day be-<pb n="4087" />fore the calends of April. Between the equinox and themorning rising of the Vergiliæ, the calends<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> of April announce,according to Cæsar, [stormy weather].<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> Upon the third<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>before the nones of April, the Vergiliæ set in the eveningin Attica, and the day after in Bœotia, but according to Cæsarand the Chaldæans, upon the nones.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> In Egypt, at this time,Orion and his Sword begin to set. According to Cæsar, thesetting of Libra on the sixth before<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> the ides of April announcesrain. On the fourteenth before<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> the calends of May,the Suculæ set to the people of Egypt in the evening, a stormyconstellation, and significant of tempests both by land and sea.This constellation sets on the sixteenth<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> in Attica, and on thefifteenth, according to Cæsar, announcing four days of badweather in succession: in Assyria it sets upon the twelfth<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>before the calends of May. This constellation has ordinarily thename of Parilicium, from the circumstance that the eleventh<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>before the calends of May is observed as the natal day of theCity of Rome; upon this day, too, fine weather generally returns, andgives us a clear sky for our observations. TheGreeks call the Suculæ by the name of "Hyades,"<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> in consequenceof the rain and clouds which they bring with them;while our people, misled by the resemblance of the Greek nameto another word<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> of theirs, meaning a "pig," have imaginedthat the constellation receives its name from that word, andhave consequently given it, in their ignorance, the name of"Suculæ," or the "Little Pigs."</p><p>In the calculations made by Cœsar, the eighth<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> before thecalends of May is a day remarked, and on the seventh<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> beforethe calends, the constellation of the Kids rises in Egypt. Onthe sixth before<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> the calends, the Dog sets in the evening inBœotia and Attica, and the Lyre rises in the morning. Onthe fifth<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> before the calends of May, Orion has wholly set<pb n="4088" />to the people of Assyria, and on the fourth<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> before the calendsthe Dog. On the sixth before<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> the nones of May, the Suculærise in the morning, according to the calculation of Cæsar, andon the eighth before<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> the ides, the She-goat, which announcesrain. In Egypt the Dog sets in the evening of the same day.Such are pretty nearly the movements of the constellations upto the sixth before<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> the ides of May, the period of the risingof the Vergiliæ.</p><p>In this interval of time, during the first fifteen days, theagriculturist must make haste and do all the work for whichhe has not been able to find time before the vernal equinox;and he should bear in mind that those who are late in pruningtheir vines are exposed to jibes and taunts, in imitation of thenote of the bird of passage known to us as the cuckoo.<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> For itis looked upon as a disgrace, and one that subjects him towell-merited censure, for that bird, upon its arrival, to find himonly then pruning his vines. Hence it is, too, that we findthose cutting jokes,<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> of which our peasantry are the object, atthe beginning of spring. Still, however, all such jokes are tobe looked upon as most abominable, from the ill omens<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span> theyconvey.</p><p>In this way, then, we see that, in agricultural operations,the most trifling things are construed as so many hints suppliedus by Nature. The latter part of this period is the propertime for sowing panic and millet; the precise moment, however, isjust after the barley has ripened. In the case of thevery same land, too, there is one sign that points in commonboth to the ripening of the barley and the sowing of panic andmillet—the appearance of the glow-worm, shining in the fieldsat night. "Cicindelæ"<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span> is the name given by the countrypeople to these flying stars, while the Greeks call them"lampyrides,"—another manifestation of the incredible bounteousnessof Nature.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Twenty-fifth of March.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">First of April.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This passage is omitted in the original, but was probably left out byinadvertence.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Third of April.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Fifth of April.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Eighth of April.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Eighteenth of April.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Sixteenth of April.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Twentieth of April.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Twenty-first of April.
