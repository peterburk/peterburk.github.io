It is a plant better able to endure the rigoursof the winter than the lettuce<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>, and possessed of a more acridtaste, though the flavour of the stalk<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> is equally agreeable.Endive is sown at the beginning of spring, and transplantedat the end of that season. There is also a kind of spreading<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> endive, known in Egypt as "cichorium,"<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> of which weshall have occasion<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> to speak elsewhere more at length.<pb n="4183" /></p><p>A method has been discovered of preserving all the thyrsior leaves of the lettuce in pots, the object being to have themfresh when wanted for boiling. Lettuces may be sown all theyear<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> through in a good soil, well-watered and carefully manured<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>; two months being allowed to intervene between sowing and transplanting, and two more between transplantingand gathering them when ripe. The rule is, however, to sowthem just after the winter solstice, and to transplant when thewest winds begin to prevail, or else to sow at this latter period,and to plant out at the vernal equinox. The white lettuce isthe best adapted for standing the rigours of the winter.</p><p>All the garden plants are fond of moisture; lettuces thrive,more particularly, when well manured, and endive even moreso. Indeed, it is found an excellent plan to plant them out withthe roots covered up in manure, and to keep up the supply, theearth being cleared away for that purpose. Some, again, haveanother method of increasing their size; they cut them<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> downwhen they have reached half a foot in height, and cover themwith fresh swine's dung. It is the general opinion that thoselettuces only will admit of being blanched which are producedfrom white seed; and even then, as soon as they begin togrow, sand from the sea-shore should be spread over them,care being taken to tie the leaves as soon as ever they beginto come to any size.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Endive, in fact, belongs to the same family as the lettuce.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is not the case; unless, indeed, under the name "lactuca,"Pliny would include several plants, that in reality are not lettuces.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The stalk, in fact, is more intensely bitter than the leaves.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Erraticun."
