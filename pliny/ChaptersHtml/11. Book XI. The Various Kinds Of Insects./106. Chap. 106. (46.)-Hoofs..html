The swine in some places in Illyricumhave solid hoofs. Nearly all the horned animals are cloven-footed, no animal having solid hoofs and two horns. TheIndian ass is only a one-horned animal, and the oryx is both<pb n="3090" />one-horned and cloven-footed. The Indian ass<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> is theonly solid-hoofed animal that has pastern-bones. As toswine, they are looked upon as a sort of mongrel race, with amixture of both kinds, and hence it is that their ankle-bonesare so misshapen. Those authors who have imagined thatman has similar pastern-bones, are easily to be confuted. Thelynx is the only one among the animals that have the feetdivided into toes, that has anything bearing a resemblanceto a pastern-bone; while with the lion it is more crookedstill. The great pastern-bone is straight, and situate in thejoints of the foot; it projects outwards in a convex protuberance, and is held fast in its vertebration by certain ligaments.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The rhinoceros.</p></body>
