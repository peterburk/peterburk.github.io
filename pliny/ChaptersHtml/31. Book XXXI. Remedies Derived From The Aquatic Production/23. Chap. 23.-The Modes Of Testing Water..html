There is, however, a more certain modeof ascertaining the difference in quality, that water being thebetter of the two which becomes hot and cold with the greatestrapidity: in addition to which, not to keep poising a balance,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>after water has been drawn up in vessels, if it is good, it shouldgradually become warmer, they say, when placed upon theground. Which water, then, of the several kinds will bemost likely to be good and wholesome? Well-water, no doubt,if we are to judge from the general use made of it in cities:but only in the case of wells in which it is kept in continualagitation by repeated drawing, and is refined by the earth actingas a filter. These conditions are sufficient to ensure salubrityin water: in regard to coolness, the well must be in a shadedspot, and the water kept exposed to the air. There is, however,one thing above all to be observed, a point, too, of considerableimportance with reference to the continuance of the flow—thespring must issue from the bed of the well, and not from thesides. To make water cold to the touch may be effected artificially even, either by forcing it to rise aloft or by making itfall from a height, and so come in collision with the air, and be-come incorporated<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> therewith: for in swimming,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> we find,when we hold our breath, the water is felt to be all the colder.</p><p>It was the Emperor Nero's invention<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> to boil water, andthen enclose it in glass vessels and cool it in snow; a methodwhich ensures all the enjoyment of a cold beverage, without anyof the inconveniences resulting from the use of snow. Indeed, itis generally admitted that all water is more<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> wholesome when<pb n="5487" />it has been boiled; as also, that water when it has once beenheated, will become more intensely<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> cold than before—a mostingenious discovery.<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> The best corrective of unwholesomewater is to boil it down to one half. Cold water, taken internally, arrests hæmorrhage. By keeping cold water in hismouth, a person may render himself proof against the intenseheat of the bath. Many a person knows by his own every-dayexperience, that water which is the coldest to drink is not ofnecessity the coldest to the touch, this delightful property beingsubject to considerable fluctuations.<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Statera." Ajasson remarks that it does not require an instrument<hi rend="ital">very</hi> nicely adjusted to indicate the difference in weight between pure andvery impure water. Synesius, Ep. xv., gives an account of the "hydroscopium" used by the ancients for ascertaining the weight of water. Beckmann enters into a lengthy examination of it, as also an enquiry into thequestion whether the ancients, and among them Pliny, were acquaintedwith the hydrometer. See his <hi rend="ital">Hist. Inv.</hi> Vol. II. pp. 163—169. <hi rend="ital">Bohn's Ed.</hi></p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Ne manus pendeant." These words, which Hardouin pronouncesto be full of obscurity, have caused considerable discussion. The passageappears to be imperfect, but it is not improbable that he alludes to the useof the balance or scales for ascertaining the comparative wholesomeness ofwater.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Corripiat."</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The thread of his reasoning is not <hi rend="ital">very</hi> perceptible; but he seems tomean that the more air there is in a body the colder it is. If the air isinhaled by a person when eating peppermint, he will be sensible of a coldfeeling in the mouth.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Galen believes this method to have been known to Hippocrates, andAristotle was undoubtedly acquainted with it.

The experiments made by Mariotte, Perrault,the Academy del Cimento, Mariana, and others, showed no perceptible difference in the time of freezing, between boiled and unboiled water; but theformer produced ice harder and clearer, the latter ice more full of blisters.In later times, Dr. Black, of Edinburgh, has from his experiments assertedthe contrary. "Boiled water," he says, "becomes ice sooner than unboiled,if the latter be left at perfect rest." Beckmann's <hi rend="ital">Hist.
