<div2 type="chapter" n="34" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 34. (22.)—WOLVES; THE ORIGIN OF THE STORY OF VERSIPELLIS.</head><p>In Italy also it is believed that there is a noxious influencein the eye of a wolf; it is supposed that it will instantly take<pb n="2283" />away the voice of a man,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> if it is the first to see him. Africaand Egypt produce wolves of a sluggish and stunted nature;<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> those of the colder climates are fierce and savage.That men have been turned into wolves, and again restored totheir original form,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> we must confidently look upon as untrue,unless, indeed, we are ready to believe all the tales, which, forso many ages, have been found to be fabulous. But, as thebelief of it has become so firmly fixed in the minds of thecommon people, as to have caused the term "Versipellis"<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> tobe used as a common form of imprecation, I will here pointout its origin. Euanthes, a Grecian author of no mean reputation, informs us that the Arcadians assert that a memberof the family of one Anthus is chosen by lot, and then takento a certain lake in that district, where, after suspendinghis clothes on an oak, he swims across the water and goesaway into the desert, where he is changed into a wolf and associates with other animals of the same species for a space ofnine years. If he has kept himself from beholding a manduring the whole of that time, he returns to the same lake,and, after swimming across it, resumes his original form, onlywith the addition of nine years in age to his former appearance. To this Fabius<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> adds, that he takes his former clothes aswell. It is really wonderful to what a length the credulity<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> of<pb n="2284" />the Greeks will go! There is no falsehood, if ever so barefaced,to which some of them cannot be found to bear testimony.</p><p>So too, Agriopas, who wrote the Olympionics,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> informs usthat Demænetus, the Parrhasian, during a sacrifice of humanvictims, which the Arcadians were offering up to the Lycæan<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>Jupiter, tasted the entrails of a boy who had been slaughtered;upon which he was turned into a wolf, but, ten years afterwards, was restored to his original shape and his calling of anathlete, and returned victorious in the pugilistic contests atthe Olympic games.</p><p>It is also commonly supposed, that the tail of this animalcontains a small lock of hair, which possesses an amatorypower; and that when the creature is caught, this hair is shed byit, but has no virtue whatever, unless it is procured from theanimal while alive.<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> It is said that these animals couple forno more than twelve days in the year;<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> and that when pressedby hunger they will eat earth. Among the points of augury,to have our progress cut short to the right by a wolf, if at thetime its mouth is full, is the best of omens. There is aspecies, which is known as the stag-wolf, such as we have already said<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> were brought from Gaul and exhibited in the Circusby Pompeius Magnus. It is said, that however hungry thisanimal may chance to be, if it only turns its head while eating,it immediately becomes oblivious of the food that is beforeit, and takes its departure to seek it elsewhere.<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hence the proverbial expression applied to a person who is suddenlysilent upon the entrance of another; "Lupus est tibi visus."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier says, that the wolves of Africa are of the ordinary size, andconjectures that this remark probably applies to the chakale, or "Canisaureus" of Linnæus, which is of the colour of the wolf, and the size of thefox, and is common throughout all Africa.—B.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The opinion that men were converted into wolves by enchantment, ora preternatural agency, was at one time so generally received, as to haveled to judicial processes, and the condemnation of the supposed criminal.—B. To the relator of the above story that men lose their voice on seeing awolf, Scaliger wishes as many blows as at different times he had seen a wolfwithout losing his voice.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This literally means "changing the skin;" it was applied by someancient medical writers to a peculiar form of insanity, where the patientconceives himself changed into a wolf, and named <foreign lang="greek">lukanqrw/pia,</foreign> "lycanthropy." The word appears to have been in common use among the Romans, and to have been applied by them to any one who had undergone aremarkable change in his character and habits; in this sense it is used byPlautus, Amphitryon, Prol. 1. 123, and Bacchides, A. iv. sc. 4, 1. 12.—B.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is not known who is here referred to; it is not probable that it isFabius Pictor, the Roman historian.—B.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is rather curious to find Pliny censuring others for <hi rend="ital">credulity;</hi> indeedhe loses no opportunity of a hit at the Greeks, to whom, after all, he isgreatly indebted. See Introduction to vol. i. p. 17.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">An account of the victories gained at the Olympic games.—B.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It has been conjectured, that the epithet, "Lycæan," <foreign lang="greek">Au/kaios,</foreign> wasgiven to Jupiter by the Arcadians, for this supposed conversion of men intowolves, which was conceived to be effected by divine interposition.—B.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It does not appear what is the foundation of this opinion; of course,it is without truth.—B.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. vi. c. 35, says that they couple once only inthe year. Ælian, Anim. Nat. B. iv. c. 4, says that their bringing forthcontinues twelve days.—B.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See c. 28 of the present Book. He alludes probably to the lynx.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is not easy to say whence this opinion was derived; the generalcharacter of the wolf is that of quickness and watchfulness, rather thanstupidity.—B. But it would appear that it is the lynx that is alluded to.</p></body>
