<div2 type="chapter" n="48" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 48. (30.)—THE VARIOUS KINDS OF POLYPI; THEIRSHREWDNESS.</head><p>Belonging to the genus of polypi is the animal known as the<pb n="2420" />ozæna,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> being so called from the peculiarly strong smellexhaled by the head;<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> in consequence of which, the mu-rænæ<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> pursue it with the greatest eagerness. The polypikeep themselves concealed for two months in the year; theydo not live beyond two<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> years, and always die of consumption, the females even sooner,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> and mostly after bringingforth. I must not omit here the observations which L. Lucullus, the proconsul of Bætica, made with reference to thepolypus, and which Trebius Niger, one of his suite, has published. He says that it is remarkably fond of shell-fish, andthat these, the moment that they feel themselves touched byit, close their valves, and cut off the feelers of the polypus,thus making a meal at the expense of the plunderer. Shellfish are destitute of sight, and, indeed, all other sensations butthose which warn them of hunger and the approach of danger.Hence it is, that the polypus lies in ambush<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> till the fish opensits shell, immediately upon which, it places within it a smallpebble, taking care, at the same time, to keep it from touching the body of the animal, lest, by making some movement,it should chance to eject it. Having made itself thus secure, it attacks its prey, and draws out the flesh, while theother tries to contract itself, but all in vain, in consequence ofthe separation of the shell, thus effected by the insertion ofthe wedge. So great is the instinctive shrewdness in animalsthat are otherwise quite remarkable for their lumpish stupidity.</p><p>In addition to the above, the same author states, that thereis not an animal in existence, that is more dangerous for itspowers of destroying a human being<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> when in the water.<pb n="2421" />Embracing his body, it counteracts his struggles, and drawshim under with its feelers and its numerous suckers, when, asoften is the case, it happens to make an attack upon a shipwrecked mariner or a child. If, however, the animal is turnedover, it loses all its power; for when it is thrown upon theback, the arms open of themselves.</p><p>The other particulars, which the same author has given,appear still more closely to border upon the marvellous. AtCarteia,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> in the preserves there, a polypus was in the habit ofcoming from the sea to the<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> pickling-tubs that were leftopen, and devouring the fish laid in salt there—for it is quiteastonishing how eagerly all sea-animals follow even the verysmell of salted condiments, so much so, that it is for this reason, that the fishermen take care to rub the inside of the wickerfish-kipes<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> with them.—At last, by its repeated thefts andimmoderate depredations, it drew down upon itself the wrathof the keepers of the works. Palisades were placed beforethem, but these the polypus managed to get over by the aid ofa tree,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> and it was only caught at last by calling in the assistance of trained dogs, which surrounded it at night, as itwas returning to its prey; upon which, the keepers, awakenedby the noise, were struck with alarm at the novelty of thesight presented. First of all, the size of the polypus was enormous beyond all conception; and then it was covered all over<pb n="2422" />with dried brine, and exhaled a most dreadful stench. Whocould have expected to find a polypus there, or could have recognized it as such under these circumstances? They reallythought that they were joining battle with some monster, forat one instant, it would drive off the dogs by its horriblefumes,<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> and lash at them with the extremities of its feelers;while at another, it would strike them with its stronger arms,giving blows with so many clubs, as it were; and it was onlywith the greatest difficulty that it could be dispatched withthe aid of a considerable number of three-pronged fish-spears.The head of this animal was shewn to Lucullus; it was insize as large as a cask of fifteen amphoræ, and had a beard,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>to use the expressions of Trebius himself, which could hardlybe encircled with both arms, full of knots, like those upon a club,and thirty feet in length; the suckers or calicules,<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> as large asan urn, resembled a basin in shape, while the teeth again wereof a corresponding largeness: its remains, which were carefully preserved as a curiosity, weighed seven hundred pounds.The same author also informs us, that specimens of the sæpiaand the loligo have been thrown up on the same shores of asize fully as large: in our own seas<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> the loligo is sometimesfound five cubits in length, and the sæpia, two. These animals do not live beyond two years.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From <foreign lang="greek">o)/zw,</foreign> "to emit an odour."
