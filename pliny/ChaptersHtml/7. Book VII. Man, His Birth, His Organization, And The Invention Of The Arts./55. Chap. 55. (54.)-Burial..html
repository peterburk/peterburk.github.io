(54.)—BURIAL.</head><p>The burning of the body after death, among the Romans, isnot a very ancient usage; for formerly, they interred it.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> Afterit had been ascertained, however, in the foreign wars, thatbodies which had been buried were sometimes disinterred, thecustom of burning them was adopted. Many families, how-<pb n="2218" />ever, still observed the ancient rites, as, for example, the Cor-nelian family, no member of which had his body burnt beforeSylla, the Dictator; who directed this to be done, because,having previously disinterred the dead body of Caius Marius,he was afraid that others might retaliate on his own.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> Theterm "sepultus"<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> applies to any mode whatever of disposingof the dead body; while, on the other hand, the word "humatus" is applicable solely when it is deposited in theearth.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It would appear, from Dalechamps and Hardouin, that this statement,respecting the period when the custom of burning the body after deathwas first adopted by the Romans, is incorrect, Lemaire, vol. iii. p. 219.There is much uncertainty as to its origin, and the source from which theyborrowed it. We learn from Macrobius, that the practice was discontinuedin his time, <hi rend="ital">i. e.</hi> in the fourth century after Christ.—B.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We have the same remarks, respecting the antiquity of the customof interring the body, the continued adoption of it by the Cornelian family,and the supposed notion of Sylla, in ordering his own body to be burnt, inCicero, De Leg. B. ii. c. 22, from whom it is probable Pliny may haveborrowed them.—B.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We have no English term that will preserve the distinction whichPliny makes between the two modes of disposing of the body after death.—B.</p></body>
