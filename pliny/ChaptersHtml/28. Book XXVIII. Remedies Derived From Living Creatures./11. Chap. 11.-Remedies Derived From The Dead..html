Some persons recommend the tooth to be fumigatedwith the smoke of a burnt tooth, which has belonged to anotherperson of the same sex; or else to attach to the person a dogtooth, as it is called, which has been extracted from a bodybefore burial. Earth, they say, taken from out of a humanskull, acts as a depilatory to the eyelashes; it is asserted, also,that any plant which may happen to have grown there, ifchewed, will cause the teeth to come out; and that if a circleis traced round an ulcer with a human bone, it will be effectually prevented from spreading.</p><p>Some persons, again, mix water in equal proportions fromthree different wells, and, after making a libation with part ofit in a new earthen vessel, administer the rest to patients suffering from tertian fever, when the paroxysms come on. So,too, in cases of quartan fever, they take a fragment of a nailfrom a cross, or else a piece of a halter<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> that has been usedfor crucifixion, and, after wrapping it in wool, attach it to thepatient's neck; taking care, the moment he has recovered, toconceal it in some hole to which the light of the sun cannotpenetrate.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This superstition still exists among the lower classes of this country,with reference to the beneficial effects of stroking neck diseases with thehand of a man who has been hanged.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Made of "spartum."
