<div2 type="chapter" n="27" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 27.—SEVENTY-NINE REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE HYÆNA.</head><p>But of all animals, it is the hyæna that has been held inthe highest admiration by the magicians, who have gone sofar as to attribute to it certain magical virtues even, and thepower of alluring<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> human beings and depriving them of theirsenses. Of its change of sex each year, and other monstrouspeculiarities<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> in its nature, we have spoken already;<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> wewill now proceed to describe the medicinal virtues that areascribed to it.</p><p>The hyæna, it is said, is particularly terrible to panthers; somuch so, indeed, that they will not attempt to make the slightest resistance to it, and will never attack a man who has anyportion of a hyæna's skin about him. A thing truly marvellous to tell of, if the hides of these two animals are hung upfacing one another, the hair will fall from off the panther's skin!When the hyæna flies before the hunter, it turns off on theright, and letting the man get before it, follows in his track:should it succeed in doing which, the man is sure to lose hissenses and fall from his horse even. But if, on the other hand,it turns off to the left, it is a sign that the animal is losingstrength, and that it will soon be taken. The easiest method,however, of taking it, they say, is for the hunter to tie hisgirdle with seven knots, and to make as many knots in the<pb n="5310" />whip with which he guides his horse. In addition to all this,so full of quirks and subtleties are the vain conceits of themagicians, they recommend the hyæna to be captured whilethe moon is passing through the sign of Gemini, and everyhair of it to be preserved, if possible. They say, too, that theskin of the head is highly efficacious, if attached to a personsuffering from head-ache; that the gall, applied to the forehead, is curative of ophthalmia; and that if the gall is boileddown with three cyathi of Attic honey and one ounce of saffron,it will be a most effectual preservative against that disease,the same preparation being equally good for the dispersion offilms on the eyes and cataract. If, again, this preparation iskept till it is old, it will be all the better for improving thesight, due care being taken to preserve it in a box of Cypriancopper: they assert also, that it is good for the cure of argema,eruptions and excrescences of the eyes, and marks upon thoseorgans. For diseases<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> of the crystalline humours of the eyes,it is recommended to anoint them with the gravy of hyæna'sliver roasted fresh, incorporated with clarified honey.</p><p>We learn also, from the same sources, that the teeth of thehyæna are useful for the cure of tooth-ache, the diseased toothbeing either touched with them, or the animal's teeth beingarranged in their regular order, and attached to the patient;that the shoulders of this animal are good for the cure of painsin the arms and shoulders; that the teeth, extracted from theleft side of the jaw, and wrapped in the skin of a sheep or hegoat, are an effectual cure for pains in the stomach; that thelights of the animal, taken with the food, are good for cœliacaffections; that the lights, reduced to ashes and applied with oil,are also soothing to the stomach; that the marrow of the backbone, used with old oil and gall, is strengthening to the sinews;that the liver, tasted thrice just before the paroxysms, is goodfor quartan fevers; that the ashes of the vertebræ, applied inhyena's skin with the tongue and right foot of a sea-calf and abull's gall, the whole boiled up together, are soothing for gout;that for the same disease hyæna's gall is advantageously employed in combination with stone of Assos;<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> that for cold shiverings, spasms, sudden fits of starting, and palpitations of the<pb n="5311" />heart, it is a good plan to eat some portion of a hyæna's heartcooked, care being taken to reduce the rest to ashes, and toapply it with the brains of the animal to the part affected;that this last composition, or the gall applied alone, acts asa depilatory, the hairs being first plucked out which arewanted not to grow again; that by this method superfluous hairsof the eyelids may be removed; that the flesh of the loins,eaten and applied with oil, is a cure for pains in the loins; andthat sterility in females may be removed by giving them theeye of this animal to eat, in combination with liquorice and dill,conception within three days being warranted as the result.</p><p>Persons afflicted with night-mare and dread of spectres, willexperience relief, they say, by attaching one of the large teethof a hyæna to the body, with a linen thread. In fits of deliriumtoo, it is recommended to fumigate the patient with the smokeof one of these teeth, and to attach one in front of his chest,with the fat of the kidneys, or else the liver or skin. Theyassert also that a pregnant woman will never miscarry, if shewears suspended from her neck, the white flesh from a hyena'sbreast, with seven hairs and the genitals of a stag, the wholetied up in the skin of a gazelle. The genitals, they say, eatenwith honey, act as a stimulant upon a person, according tothe sex, and this even though it should be the case of a manwho has manifested an aversion to all intercourse with females.</p><p>Nay, even more than all this, we are assured that if thegenitals and a certain joint of the vertebræ are preserved ina house with the hide adhering to them, they will ensure peaceand concord between all members of the family; hence it isthat this part is known as the "joint of the spine,"<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> or "Atlantian<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> knot." This joint, which is the first, is reckoned amongthe remedies for epilepsy.</p><p>The fumes of the burnt fat of this animal will put serpents to flight, they say; and the jawbone, pounded with aniseand taken with the food, is a cure for shivering fits. A fumigation made therewith has the effect of an emmenagogue; andsuch are the frivolous and absurd conceits of the professors ofthe magic art, that they boldly assert that if a man attaches to<pb n="5312" />his arm a tooth from the right side of the upper jaw, he willnever miss any object he may happen to aim at with a dart.The palate, dried and warmed with Egyptian alum,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> is curativeof bad odours and ulcers of the mouth, care being taken torenew the application three times. Dogs, they say, will neverbark at persons who have a hyæna's tongue in the shoe,beneath the sole of the foot. The left side of the brain, appliedto the nostrils, is said to have a soothing effect upon alldangerous maladies either in men or beasts. They say, too, thatthe skin of the forehead is a preservative against all fascinations; that the flesh of the neck, whether eaten or dried andtaken in drink, is good for pains in the loins; that the sinewsof the back and shoulders, used as a fumigation, are good forpains in the sinews; that the bristles of the snout, applied toa woman's lips, have all the effect of a philtre; and that theliver, administered in drink, is curative of griping pains andurinary calculi.</p><p>The heart, it is said, taken with the food or drink, is remedialfor all kinds of pains in the body; the milt for pains in thespleen; the caul, in combination with oil, for inflammatoryulcers; and the marrow for pains in the spine and weakness in thesinews. The strings of the kidneys, they say, if taken withwine and frankincense, will restore fruitfulness, in cases whereit has been banished through the agency of noxious spells; theuterus, taken in drink with the rind of a sweet pomegranate,is highly beneficial for diseases of the uterus; and the fat ofthe loins, used as a fumigation, removes all impediments todelivery, and accelerates parturition. The marrow of the back,attached to the body as an amulet, is an effectual remedy forfantastic illusions,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> and the genitals of the male animal, usedas a fumigation, are good for the cure of spasms. For ophthalmia, ruptures, and inflammations, the feet, which are keptfor the purpose, are touched; the left feet for affections on theright side of the body, and the right feet for affections on theleft. The left foot, if laid upon the body of a woman in travail,will be productive, they say, of fatal effects; but the right foot,similarly employed, will facilitate delivery. The vesiclewhich has contained the gall, taken in wine or with the food. is<pb n="5313" />beneficial for the cardiac disease; and the bladder, taken inwine, is a good preservative against incontinence of urine.The urine, too, which is found in the bladder, taken with oil,sesame, and honey, is said to be useful for diseases of longstanding.</p><p>The first rib and the eighth, used as a fumigation, are saidto be useful for ruptures; the vertebræ for women in travail;and the blood, in combination with polenta,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> for griping painsin the bowels. If the door-posts are touched with this blood,the various arts of the magicians will be rendered of no effect;they will neither be able to summon the gods into their presence nor to converse with them, whatever the method to whichthey have recourse, whether lamps or basin, water or globe,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>or any other method.</p><p>The flesh of the hyæna, taken as food, is said to be efficaciousfor the bite of a mad dog, and the liver still more so. Theflesh or bones of a human being which have been found in thebelly of a slain hyæna, used as a fumigation, are said to beremedial for gout: but if among these remains the nails arefound, it is looked upon as a presage of death to some one amongthose who have captured it. The excrements or bones whichhave been voided by the animal at the moment when killed,are looked upon as counter-charms to magic spells. The dungfound in the intestines is dried and administered in drink fordysentery; and it is applied to all parts of the body withgoose-grease, in the form of a liniment, in the case of personswho have received injury from some noxious medicament. Byrubbing themselves with the grease, and lying upon the skin,of a hyæna, persons who have been bitten by dogs are cured.</p><p>On the other hand, the ashes of the left pastern-bone, theysay, boiled with weasel's blood, and applied to a person's body,will ensure universal hatred; a similar effect being equallyproduced by the eye when boiled. But the most extraordinarything of all is, their assertion that the extremity of the rectumof this animal is a preservative against all oppression on thepart of chiefs and potentates, and an assurance of success in allpetitions, judgments, and lawsuits, and this, if a person onlycarries it about him. The anus, according to them, has sopowerful an effect as a philtre, that if it is worn on the leftarm, a woman will be sure to follow the wearer the moment<pb n="5314" />he looks at her. The hairs, too, of this part, reduced to ashes,and applied with oil to the body of a man who is living a lifeof disgraceful effeminacy, will render him not only modest,they assure us, but of scrupulous morals even.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. viii. c. 44.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">One peculiarity not mentioned by Pliny, is, that its skin, like that ofthe sea-calf, was said to be proof against the effects of lightning.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In 13. viii. c. 44.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Glaucomata."
