<div2 type="chapter" n="29" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 29.—ALTCA.</head><p>But among the very first things of all, we ought to speak ofthe method employed in preparing alica,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> a most delightfuland most wholesome food, and which incontestably confersupon Italy the highest rank among the countries that producethe cereals. This delicacy is prepared, no doubt, in Egyptas well, but of a very inferior quality, and not worth our notice. In Italy, however, it is prepared in numerous places,the territories of Verona and Pisæ, for example; but that ofCampania is the most highly esteemed. There, at the foot ofmountains capped with clouds, runs a plain, not less in all thanforty miles in extent. The land here—to give a descriptionfirst of the nature of the soil—is dusty on the surface, butspongy below, and as porous as pumice. The inconveniencesthat generally arise from the close vicinity of mountains arehere converted into so many advantages: for the soil, actingon it as a sort of filter, absorbs the water of the abundantrains that fall; the consequence of which is, that the water notbeing left to soak or form mud on the surface, the cultivationis greatly facilitated thereby. This land does not return, bythe aid of any springs, the moisture it has thus absorbed, butthoroughly digests it, by warming it in its bosom, in a heatedoven as it were. The ground is kept cropped the whole yearthrough, once with panic, and twice with spelt; and yet in thespring, when the soil is allowed to have a moment's repose,<pb n="4042" />it will produce roses more odoriferous by far than the cultivatedrose: for the earth here is never tired of producing, a circumstance in which originated the common saying, that Campaniaproduces more unguents<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> than other countries do oil.</p><p>In the same degree, however, that the Campanian soil excelsthat of all other countries, so does that part of it which isknown to us as Laboriæ,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and to the Greeks as Phlegræum,surpass all the rest. This district is bounded on two sides bythe consular high road, which leads from Puteoli to Capua onthe one side, and from Cumæ on the other.</p><p>Alica is prepared from the grain called zea, which we havealready mentioned<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> as being known to us as "seed" wheat.The grain is cleansed in a wooden mortar, for fear lest stone,from its hardness, should have the effect of grating it. Themotive power for raising the pestle, as is generally known, issupplied by slaves working in chains, the end of it being enclosed in a case of iron. After the husks have been removedby this process, the pure grain is broken to pieces, the sameimplements being employed. In this way, there are threedifferent kinds of alica made, the finest, the seconds, and thecoarse, which last is known as "aphærema."<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> Still, however,these various kinds have none of them that whiteness as yetfor which they are so distinguished, though even now they arepreferable to the Alexandrian alica. With this view—a mostsingular fact—chalk<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> is mixed with the meal, which, uponbecoming well incorporated with it, adds very materially toboth the whiteness and the shortness<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> of the mixture. Thischalk is found between Puteoli and Neapolis, upon a hill calledLeucogæum;<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> and there is still in existence a decree of thelate Emperor Augustus, (who established a colony at Capua),which orders a sum of twenty thousand sesterces to be paidannually from his exchequer to the people of Neapolis, for thelease of this hill. His motive for paying this rent, he stated,was the fact that the people of Campania had alleged that it<pb n="4043" />was impossible to make their alica without the help of thismineral. In the same hill, sulphur is found as well, and thesprings of Araxus issue from its declivities, the waters of whichare particularly efficacious for strengthening the sight, healingwounds, and preventing the teeth from becoming loose.</p><p>A spurious kind of alica is made, more particularly of a degenerate kind of zea grown in Africa; the ears of it are largerand blacker than those of the genuine kind, and the straw isshort. This grain is pounded with sand, and even then it iswith the greatest difficulty that the outer coats are removed;when stripped, the grain fills one half only of the originalmeasure. Gypsum, in the proportion of one fourth, is thensprinkled<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> over it, and after the mixture has been well incorporated, it is bolted through a meal-sieve. The portion thatremains behind, after this is done, is known as "excepticia,"<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>and consists of the coarser parts; while that which has passedthrough is submitted to a second process, with a finer sieve;and that which then refuses to pass has the name of "secun-daria."<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> That, again, which, in a similar manner, is submittedto a third sifting, with a sieve of the greatest fineness, whichwill only admit of sand passing through it, is known as "cribraria,"<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> when it remains on the top of the sieve.</p><p>There is another method, again, that is employed everywhere for adulterating it. They pick out the whitest andlargest grains of wheat, and parboil them in earthen pots; theseare then dried in the sun till they have regained their originalsize, after which they are lightly sprinkled with water, andthen ground in a mill. A better granæum<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> is made from zeathan from wheat, although it is nothing else, in fact, but aspurious alica: it is whitened by the addition of boiled milk,in place of chalk.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">As to the cereal so called, see c. 10 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or perfumed oils.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. iii. c. 9.
