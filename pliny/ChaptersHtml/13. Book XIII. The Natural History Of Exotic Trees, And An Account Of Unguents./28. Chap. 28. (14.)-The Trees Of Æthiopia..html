Besides this tree, there aresome palms, of which we have spoken already.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> In describingthe islands along the coast of Æthiopia, we have already mademention<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> of their trees and their odoriferous forests.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The cotton-tree, Gossypium arboreum of Linnæus.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xii. c. 21, 22.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In c. 9 of the present Book.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. vi. c. 36, 37.</p></body>
