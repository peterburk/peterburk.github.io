Its gaze is always fixed andimmoveable; it has no gums in either of its jaws, and theteeth are one continuous piece of bone; they are enclosed in asort of box as it were, that they may not be blunted by rubbing against each other. Juba informs us, that the mantichoraof Æthiopia can also imitate the human speech.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We have had some account given of the mantichora, in c. 30. Themantichora and the corocotta are altogether imaginary.—B. Cuvier. inAjasson, vol. vi. p. 447; Lemaire, vol. iii. p. 439, thinks that the storiesof the corocotta and the catoblepas, owe their origin to mutilated accountsof the hyæna, and the animal known to us as the gnu.</p></body>
