<div2 type="chapter" n="43" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 43.—LUCERNE.</head><p>Lucerne<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> is by nature an exotic to Greece even, it havingbeen first introduced into that country from Media,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> at the timeof the Persian wars with King Darius; still it deserves to bementioned among the very first of these productions. So superior are its qualities, that a single sowing will last morethan thirty<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> years. It resembles trefoil in appearance, but thestalk and leaves are articulated. The longer it grows in thestalk, the narrower is the leaf. Amphilochus has devoted awhole book to this subject and the cytisus.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> The ground inwhich it is sown, being first cleaned and cleared of stones, isturned up in the autumn, after which it is ploughed and harrowed. It is then harrowed a second and a third time, at intervals of five days; after which manure is laid upon it. Thisseed requires either a soil that is dry, but full of nutriment, orelse a well-watered one. After the ground has been thus pre-pared, the seed is put in the month of May;<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> for if sownearlier, it is in danger from the frosts. It is necessary to sowthe seed very thick, so that all the ground may be occupied,and no room left for weeds to shoot up in the intervals; aresult which may be secured by sowing twenty modii to thejugerum. The seed must be stirred at once with the rake, toprevent the sun from scorching it, and it should be coveredover with earth as speedily as possible. If the soil is naturallydamp or weedy, the lucerne will be overpowered, and the spot<pb n="4054" />degenerate into an ordinary pasture; it is necessary, therefore,directly the crop is an inch in height, to disengage it fromall weeds, by hand, in preference to the weeding-hook.</p><p>It is cut when it is just beginning to flower, and this is repeated as often as it throws out new blossoms; which happensmostly six<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> times in the year, and four at the very least.Care should be taken to prevent it from running to seed, as itis much more valuable as fodder, up to the third year. Itshould be hoed in the spring, and cleared of all other plants;and in the third year the surface should be well worked withthe weeding-hook. By adopting this method, the weeds willbe effectually destroyed, though without detriment to the lucerne, in consequence of the depth of its roots. If the weedsshould happen to get ahead of it, the only remedy is to turn itup repeatedly with the plough, until the roots of the weeds arethoroughly destroyed. This fodder should never be given tocattle to satiety, otherwise it may be necessary to let blood; itis best, too, when used while green. When dry, it becomestough and ligneous, and falls away at last into a thin, uselessdust. As to the cytisus, which also occupies the very foremostrank among the fodders, we have already spoken<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> of it at sufficient length when describing the shrubs. It remains for usnow to complete our account of all the cereals, and we shallhere devote a portion of it to the diseases to which they aresubject.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Medica," in Latin, a kind of clover, the Medicago sativa of Linnæus.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Fée is inclined to doubt this.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny exaggerates here: Columella, B. ii. c. 11, says, only "ten:" afield, however, sown with it will last, with a fresh sowing, as long astwenty years.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xiii. c. 47.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Columella, B. ii. c. 11, says April.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">By the aid of careful watering, as many as eight to fourteen cuttingsare obtained in the year, in Italy and Spain.
