<div2 type="chapter" n="2" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 2. (3.)—NUMIDIA.</head><p>At the river Ampsaga Numidia begins, a country renderedillustrious by the fame of Masinissa. By the Greeks thisregion was called Metagonitis<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>; and the Numidians receivedthe name of "Nomades" from their frequent changes of pasturage;upon which occasions they were accustomed to carry<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>their <hi rend="ital">mapalia,</hi> or in other words, their houses, upon waggons.<pb n="1388" />The towns of this country are Cullu<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and Rusicade<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>; andat a distance of forty-eight miles from the latter, in the interior,is the colony of Cirta<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>, surnamed "of the Sitiani;"still more inland is another colony called Sicca<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>, withthe free town of Bulla Regia<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>. On the coast are Tacatua<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>,Hippo Regius<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>, the river Armua<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>, and the town of Tabraca<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>,with the rights of Roman citizens. The river Tusca<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> formsthe boundary of Numidia. This country produces nothingremarkable except its marble<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> and wild beasts.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It was not only Numidia that bore this name, but all the northerncoast of Africa from the frontiers of the kingdom of Carthage near HippoRegius to the Columns of Hercules. It was thus called from the Greek<hi rend="ital">metagonos,</hi> a "descendant" or "successor;" as the Carthaginiansestablished a number of small towns and villages on the coast, whichwere thus posterior in their origin to the large cities already foundedthere.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hardouin says that the Moors in the interior still follow the sameusage, carrying their houses from pasture to pasture on waggons.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Chollum or Collo.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The modern Sgigada or Stora, according to Mannert, D'Anville,and Shaw.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The modern Constantina occupies its site. Numerous remains ofthe ancient town are still discovered. Sitius was an officer who servedunder Cæsar, and obtained a grant of this place after the defeat of Juba.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Called Urbs, or Kaff, according to D'Anville and Shaw; the latterof whom found an inscription there with the words <hi rend="ital">Ordo Siccensium.</hi></p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or 'Royal Bulla'; which epithet shows that it was either a residenceor a foundation of the kings of Numidia, and distinguishes it from a smallplace called Bulla Mensa, south of Carthage. Bulla Regia was four days'journey south-west of Carthage, on a tributary of the river Bagrada, thevalley of which is still called Wad-el-Boul. This place was one of thepoints of Ptolemy's recorded astronomical observations, having its longestday fourteen hours and one-eighth, and being distant from Alexandriatwo hours to the west.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The modern Tamseh, according to Shaw and Mannert, and Tagodet,according to D'Anville.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Its ruins are south of the modern Bona. It received the name of<hi rend="ital">Regius</hi> or 'Royal' from being the residence of the Numidian kings. Itwas also famed as being the see of St. Augustine. It was a colony ofTyre, and stood on the bay now forming the Gulf of Bona. It was oneof the most flourishing cities of Africa till it was destroyed by the VandalsA.D. <date value="430" authname="430">430</date>.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now the Mafragg, according to Mannert.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Still called Tabarca, according to Hardouin.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now the Zaina, according to Marcus.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">For the character of the Numidian marble, see Pliny, B. xxxvi. c. 7.</p></body>
