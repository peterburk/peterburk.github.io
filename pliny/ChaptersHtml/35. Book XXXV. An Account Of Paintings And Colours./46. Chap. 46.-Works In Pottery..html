<div2 type="chapter" n="46" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 46.ÑWORKS IN POTTERY.</head><p>Statues of this nature are still in existence at variousplaces. At Rome, in fact, and in our municipal towns, westill see many such pediments of temples; wonderful too, for theirworkmanship, and, from their artistic merit and long duration,more deserving of our respect than gold, and certainly far lessbaneful. At the present day even, in the midst of suchwealth as we possess, we make our first libation at the sacrifice,not from murrhine<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> vases or vessels of crystal, but from ladles<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>made of earthenware.</p><p>Bounteous beyond expression is the earth, if we only considerin detail her various gifts. To omit all mention of the cereals,wine, fruits, herbs, shrubs, medicaments, and metals, bountieswhich she has lavished upon us, and which have already passedunder our notice, her productions in the shape of potteryalone, would more than suffice, in their variety, to satisfy ourdomestic wants; what with gutter-tiles of earthenware, vats forreceiving wine, pipes<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> for conveying water, conduits<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> forsupplying baths, baked tiles for roofs, bricks for foundations,the productions, too, of the potter's wheel; results, all ofthem, of an art, which induced King Numa to establish, as aseventh company,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> that of the makers of earthenware.</p><p>Even more than this, many persons have chosen to be buriedin coffins<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> made of earthenware; M. Varro, for instance, who<pb n="6287" />was interred, in true Pythagorean style, in the midst of leavesof myrtle, olive, and black poplar; indeed, the greater part ofmankind make use of earthen vases for this purpose. For theservice of the table, the Samian pottery is even yet held in highesteem; that, too, of Arretium in Italy, still maintains its highcharacter; while for their cups, and for those only, the manufactoriesof Surrentum, Asta, Pollentia, Saguntum in Spain,and Pergamus in Asia,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> are greatly esteemed.</p><p>The city of Tralles, too, in Asia, and that of Mutina in Italy,have their respective manufactures of earthenware, and evenby this branch of art are localities rendered famous; their productions,by the aid of the potter's wheel, becoming known toall countries, and conveyed by sea and by land to everyquarter of the earth. At Erythr¾, there are still shown, ina temple there, two amphor¾, that were consecrated in consequenceof the singular thinness of the material: they originatedin a contest between a master and his pupil, which of thetwo could make earthenware of the greatest thinness. Thevessels of Cos are the most highly celebrated for their beauty,but those of Adria<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> are considered the most substantial.</p><p>In relation to these productions of art, there are some instancesof severity mentioned: Q. Coponius, we find, wascondemned for bribery, because he made present of an amphoraof wine to a person who had the right of voting. Tomake luxury, too, conduce in some degree to enhance our estimationof earthenware, "tripatinium,"<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> as we learn fromFenestella, was the name given to the most exquisite course ofdishes that was served up at the Roman banquets. It consistedof one dish of mur¾n¾,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> one of lupi,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> and a third of amixture of fish. It is clear that the public manners werethen already on the decline; though we still have a right tohold them preferable to those of the philosophers even ofGreece, seeing that the representatives of Aristotle, it is said,sold, at the auction of his goods, as many as seventy dishes ofearthenware. It has been already<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> stated by us, when on thesubject of birds, that a single dish cost the tragic actor ®sopusone hundred thousand sesterces; much to the reader's indignation,no doubt; but, by Hercules! Vitellius, when emperor,<pb n="6288" />ordered a dish to be made, which was to cost a million ofsesterces, and for the preparation of which a furnace had tobe erected out in the fields! luxury having thus arrived atsuch a pitch of excess as to make earthenware even sell athigher prices than murrhine<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> vessels. It was in reference tothis circumstance, that Mucianus, in his second consulship,when pronouncing one of his perorations, reproached thememory of Vitellius with his dishes as broad as the PomptineMarsh; not less deserving to be execrated than the poisoneddish of Asprenas, which, according to the accusation broughtagainst him by Cassius Severus, caused the death of onehundred and thirty guests.<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span></p><p>These works of artistic merit have conferred celebrity onsome cities even, Rhegium for example, and Cum¾. Thepriests of the Mother of the gods, known as the Galli, deprivethemselves of their virility with a piece of Samian<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> pottery,the only means, if we believe M. C¾lius,<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> of avoiding dangerousresults. He it was, too, who recommended, when inveighingagainst certain abominable practices, that the person guilty ofthem should have his tongue cut out, in a similar manner;a reproach which would appear to have been levelled by anticipationagainst this same Vitellius.</p><p>What is there that human industry will not devise? Evenbroken pottery has been utilized; it being found that, beatento powder, and tempered with lime, it becomes more solid anddurable than other substances of a similar nature; forming thecement known as the "Signine"<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> composition, so extensivelyemployed for even making the pavements of houses.<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxxiii. c. 2, and B. xxxvii. cc. 7, 8, 11.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Simpuvia."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxxi. c. 31.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Mammatis."
