Nearly all kinds of fish that are covered withscales are gregarious. They are most easily taken before sunrise;<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> for then more particularly their powers of seeing aredefective. They sleep during the night; and when the weatheris clear, are able to see just as well then as during theday. It is said, also, that it greatly tends to promote theircapture to drag the bottom of the water, and that by so doingmore are taken at the second haul<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> than at the first. Theyare especially fond of the taste of oil, and find nutriment ingentle showers of rain. Indeed, the very reeds,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> even, althoughthey are produced in swamps, will not grow to maturity without the aid of rain: in addition to this, we find that whereverfishes remain constantly in the same water, if it is not renewedthey will die.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle, Hist.

Ovid, in his Halieuticon, 1. 107,alludes to the same notion that is here mentioned: "And the channe,that reproduces itself, deprived of two-fold parents." Cuvier remarks,that, wonderful as these assertions may be, they are not devoid, to all appearance, of a certain foundation; for that Cavolini has observed in thePerca cabrilla and Perca scriba of Linnæus, a species of hermaphroditism;the ovary having always in the interior a lobe, which, from its conformation, would appear to be for the milt; and that he is strongly of opinionthat in this species, and some others of the same genus, all the fish produceeggs, and fecundate them themselves.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier says, that the channe is the Perca cabrilla of Linnæus, one ofthe serrans or trumpet-fish of the coasts of Provence. According to Forskal, <hi rend="ital">Fauna Arabica,</hi> and Sonnini, it still has the name among the Turksand modern Greeks, of "chani," or "channo," and it was in these thatCavolini observed the singular organization previously mentioned. According to Athenæus, B. vii., Aristotle has described this fish as of a red colour, variegated with black rays, which answers very well to the Percascriba of Linnæus, approaching most nearly to the Perca cabrilla.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle, Hist.
