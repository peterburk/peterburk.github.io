In former times it was sold at thirty sesterces perpound; but there has been found of late in the Spanishprovinces a sand which admits of a similar preparation, andconsequently armenium has come to be sold so low as at sixdenarii per pound. It differs from cæruleum in a certaindegree of whiteness, which causes the colour it yields to bethinner in comparison. The only use made of it in medicineis for the purpose of giving nourishment to the hair, that ofthe eyelids in particular.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Armenium."
