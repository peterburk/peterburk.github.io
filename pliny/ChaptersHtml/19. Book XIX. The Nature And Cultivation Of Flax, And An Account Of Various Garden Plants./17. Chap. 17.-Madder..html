Thefirst of these is madder,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> the employment of which is necessary in dyeing wool and leather. The madder of Italy is themost esteemed, and that more particularly which is grown inthe suburbs of the City; nearly all our provinces, too, produce it in great abundance.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> It grows spontaneously, but iscapable of reproduction by sowing, much after the same manner as the fitch. The stem,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> however, is prickly, and articulated, with five leaves arranged round each joint: the seed isred. Its medicinal properties we shall have occasion to mention in the appropriate place.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Rubia tinctorum of Linnæus.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Dioscorides speaks of the madder of Ravenna as being the mostesteemed. It is much cultivated at the present day in the South ofFrance, Holland, and the Levant. That of Lille enjoys a high reputation.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is covered with bristly hairs, or rather, fine, hooked teeth. Thereis, however, no resemblance whatever between it and ervilia or orobus,the fitch.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">B. xxiv. c. 56.</p></body>
