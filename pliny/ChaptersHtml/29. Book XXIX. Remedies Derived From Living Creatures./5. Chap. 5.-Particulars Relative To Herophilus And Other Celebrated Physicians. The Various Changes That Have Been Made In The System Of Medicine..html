<div2 type="chapter" n="5" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 5.—PARTICULARS RELATIVE TO HEROPHILUS AND OTHERCELEBRATED PHYSICIANS. THE VARIOUS CHANGES THAT HAVEBEEN MADE IN THE SYSTEM OF MEDICINE.</head><p>These several schools of medicine, long at variance amongthemselves, were all of them condemned by Herophilus,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> whoregulated the arterial pulsation according to the musical<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>scale, correspondingly with the age of the patient. In succeeding years again, the theories of this sect were abandoned,it being found that to belong to it necessitated an acquaintancewith literature. Changes, too, were effected in the school, ofwhich, as already<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> stated, Asclepiades had become the founder.His disciple, Themison,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> who at first in his writings implicitlyfollowed him, soon afterwards, in compliance with the growingdegeneracy of the age, went so far as to modify his own methods of treatment; which, in their turn, were entirely dis-placed, with the authorization of the late Emperor Augustus,by Antonius Musa,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> a physician who had rescued that prince<pb n="5373" />from a most dangerous malady, by following a mode of treatment diametrically opposite.I pass over in silence many physicians of the very highestcelebrity, the Cassii, for instance, the Calpetani, the Arruntii,and the Rubrii, men who received fees yearly from the great,amounting to no less than two hundred and fifty thousandsesterces. As for Q. Stertinius, he thought that he conferredan obligation upon the emperors in being content with fivehundred thousand<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> sesterces per annum; and indeed he proved,by an enumeration of the several houses, that a city practicewould bring him in a yearly income of not less than six hundred thousand sesterces.</p><p>Fully equal to this was the sum lavished upon his brotherby Claudius Cæsar; and the two brothers, although they haddrawn largely upon their fortunes in beautifying the publicbuildings at Neapolis, left to their heirs no less than thirtymillions of sesterces!<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> such an estate as no physician but Arruntius had till then possessed.</p><p>Next in succession arose Vettius Valens, rendered so noto-rious by his adulterous connection<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> with Messalina, the wifeof Claudius Cæsar, and equally celebrated as a professor ofeloquence. When established in public favour, he became thefounder of a new sect.</p><p>It was in the same age, too, during the reign of the EmperorNero, that the destinies of the medical art passed into thehands of Thessalus,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> a man who swept away all the preceptsof his predecessors, and declaimed with a sort of frenzy againstthe physicians of every age; but with what discretion andin what spirit, we may abundantly conclude from a single traitpresented by his character—upon his tomb, which is stillto be seen on the Appian Way, he had his name inscribed asthe "Iatronices"—the "Conqueror of the Physicians." Nostage-player, no driver of a three-horse chariot, had a greaterthrong attending him when he appeared in public: but hewas at last eclipsed in credit by Crinas, a native of Massilia,who, to wear an appearance of greater discreetness and moredevoutness, united in himself the pursuit of two sciences, and<pb n="5374" />prescribed diets to his patients in accordance with the move-ments of the heavenly bodies, as indicated by the almanacksof the mathematicians, taking observations himself of thevarious times and seasons. It was but recently that he died,leaving ten millions of sesterces, after having expended hardlya less sum upon building the walls of his native place andof other towns.</p><p>It was while these men were ruling our destinies, thatall at once, Charmis, a native also of Massilia, took<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> theCity by surprise. Not content with condemning the practiceor preceding physicians, he proscribed the use of warm bathsas well, and persuaded people, in the very depth of wintereven, to immerse themselves in cold water. His patientshe used to plunge into large vessels filled with cold water,and it was a common thing to see aged men of consularrank make it a matter of parade to freeze themselves; amethod of treatment, in favour of which Annæus<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> Seneca giveshis personal testimony, in writings still extant.</p><p>There can be no doubt whatever, that all these men, in thepursuit of celebrity by the introduction of some novelty or other,made purchase of it at the downright expense of human life.Hence those woeful discussions, those consultations at the bedside of the patient, where no one thinks fit to be of the sameopinion as another, lest he may have the appearance of beingsubordinate to another; hence, too, that ominous inscriptionto be read upon a tomb, "It was the multitude of physiciansthat killed me."<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span></p><p>The medical art, so often modified and renewed as it hasbeen, is still on the change from day to day, and still are weimpelled onwards by the puffs<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> which emanate from the ingenuity of the Greeks. It is quite evident too, that everyone among them that finds himself skilled in the art of speech,may forthwith create himself the arbiter of our life and death:as though, forsooth, there were not thousands<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> of nations who<pb n="5375" />live without any physicians at all, though not, for all that,without the aid of medicine. Such, for instance, was the Roman<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> people, for a period of more than six hundred years; apeople, too, which has never shown itself slow to adopt alluseful arts, and which even welcomed the medical art withavidity, until, after a fair experience of it, there was foundgood reason to condemn it.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See end of B. xi.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xi. c. 88.
