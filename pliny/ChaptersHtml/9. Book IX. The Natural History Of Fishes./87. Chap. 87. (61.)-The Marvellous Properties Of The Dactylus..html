In the moutheven, while they are being eaten, they give forth their light, andthe same too when in the hands; the very drops, in fact, thatfall from them on the ground, or on the clothes, are of the samenature. Hence it is beyond a doubt, that it is a liquid thatpossesses this peculiar property, which, even in a solid body,would be a ground for considerable surprise.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Or finger." The same fish that have been mentioned as "ungues," or"onyches," in c. 51 of the present Book. They are a multivalve shellfish, Cuvier says, which live in hardened mud or the interior of rocks, intowhich they burrow cavities, from which they cannot retreat; and they canonly be taken by breaking the stone. They have a flavour like pepper,and give out a phosphorescent light. See the end of c. 51.</p></body>
