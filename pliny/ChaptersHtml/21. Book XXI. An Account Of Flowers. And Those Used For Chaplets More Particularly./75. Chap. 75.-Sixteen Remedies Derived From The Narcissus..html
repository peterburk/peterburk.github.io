<div2 type="chapter" n="75" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 75.—SIXTEEN REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE NARCISSUS.</head><p>Two varieties of the narcissus are employed in medicine,the one with a purple<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> flower, and the herbaceous narcissus.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>This last is injurious to the stomach, and hence it is that itacts both as an emetic and as a purgative: it is prejudicial,also, to the sinews, and produces dull, heavy pains in the head:hence it is that it has received its name, from "narce,"<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> andnot from the youth Narcissus, mentioned in fable. The roots ofboth kinds of narcissus have a flavour resembling that of winemixed with honey. This plant is very useful, applied toburns with a little honey, as also to other kinds of wounds,and sprains. Applied topically, too, with honey and oatmeal,it is good for tumours, and it is similarly employed for theextraction of foreign substances from the body.</p><p>Beaten up in polenta and oil it effects the cure of contusions and blows inflicted by stones; and, mixed with meal,<pb n="4368" />it effectually cleanses wounds, and speedily removes blackmorphews from the skin. Of this flower oil of narcissus ismade, good for softening indurations of the skin, and for warming parts of the body that have been frost-bitten. It is verybeneficial, also, for the ears, but is very apt to producehead-ache.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See c. 12 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Narcissus pseudo-narcissus of Linnæus, the meadow narcissus,or daffodil.
