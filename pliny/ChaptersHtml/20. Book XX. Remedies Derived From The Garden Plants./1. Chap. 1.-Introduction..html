And let no one, misled bythe apparent triviality of the names which we shall have toemploy, regard this subject as one that is frivolous or contemptible:for we shall here have to set forth the state of peaceor of war which exists between the various departments ofNature, the hatreds or friendships which are maintained byobjects dumb and destitute of sense, and all, too, created—awonderful subject for our contemplation!—for the sake of manalone. To these states, known to the Greeks by the respectiveappellations "sympathia" and "antipathia," we are indebted for thefirst principles<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> of all things; for hence it is thatwater has the property of extinguishing fire, that the sunabsorbs water, that the moon produces it, and that each ofthose heavenly bodies is from time to time eclipsed by theother.</p><p>Hence it is, too, descending from the contemplation of aloftier sphere, that the loadstone<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> possesses the property of at-<pb n="4207" />tracting iron, and another stone,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> again, that of repelling it:and that the diamond, that pride of luxury and opulence,though infrangible by every other object, and presenting aresistance that cannot be overcome, is broken asunder by ahe-goat's blood<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>—in addition to numerous other marvels ofwhich we shall have to speak on more appropriate occasions,equal to this or still more wonderful even. My only request isthat pardon may be accorded me for beginning with objects ofa more humble nature, though still so greatly conducive to ourhealth—I mean the garden plants, of which I shall now proceed to speak.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Fée remarks, that the commencement of this exordium is contrary totruth, and that Pliny appears to forget that in the Eighteenth Book hehas treated, at very considerable length, of the various cereals, the art ofpreparing bread, pottages, ptisans. &amp;c. He suggests, that the author mayhave originally intended to place the Eighteenth Book <hi rend="ital">after</hi> the presentone, and that on changing his plan he may have neglected to alter the present passage. From his mention, however, of man's "ignorance by whatmeans he exists," it is not improbable that he may have considered thatthe nutritive qualities of plants are really based upon their medicinal vir-tues, a point of view little regarded by the majority of mankind in histime, but considered by Pliny to be the true key to a just appreciation oftheir utility.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Quibus cuncta constant."
