In succession to these, again, barley may be put in, orelse wheat, as in Campania; and it will be quite enough, insuch case, to plough the ground when the seed is sown. Thereis another rotation again—when the ground has been croppedwith spelt,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> it should lie fallow the four winter months; afterwhich, spring beans should be put in, to keep it occupied tillthe time comes for cropping it with winter beans. Where thesoil is too rich, it may lie fallow one year, care being taken aftersowing it with corn to crop it with the leguminous plants thethird year.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> Where, on the other hand, it is too thin, the landshould lie fallow up to the third year even. Some persons recommend that corn should never be sown except in land whichhas lain fallow the year before.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. xvii. c. 3.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Tenerum.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Adoreum.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Tertio" may possibly mean the "third time," <hi rend="ital">i. e.</hi> forevery third crop.</p></body>
