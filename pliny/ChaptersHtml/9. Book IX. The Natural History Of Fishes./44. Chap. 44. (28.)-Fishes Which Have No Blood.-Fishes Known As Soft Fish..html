(28.)—FISHES WHICH HAVE NO BLOOD.—FISHES KNOWN AS SOFT FISH.</head><p>The varieties of fish which we shall now mention are thosewhich have no blood: they are of three kinds<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>—first, thosewhich are known as "soft;" next, those which have thin crusts;and, lastly, those which are enclosed in hard shells. The softfish are the loligo,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> the sæpia,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> the polypus,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and others of asimilar nature. These last have the head between the feetand the belly, and have, all of them, eight feet: in the sæpiaand the loligo two of these feet are very long<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> and rough,and by means of these they lift the food to their mouth, andattach themselves to places in the sea, as though with ananchor; the others act as so many arms, by means of whichthey seize their prey.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span><pb n="2417" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier remarks, that this division of the bloodless fish by Aristotle intothe mollusca, testacea, and crustacea, has been followed by naturalists almostdown to the present day.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Sæpia loligo of Linneus; the calmar of the French, or ink-fish.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Sæpia officinalis of Linnæus; the seche of the French; our cuttlefish.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Sepia octopodia of Linnæus, or eight-footed cuttle-fish.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier remarks, that this account of the arms or feelers of the sæpiaand loligo is very exact.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Quibus venantur." Hardouin suggests that the proper readingwould be "quibus natant"—"by means of which they swim;" for Aristotlesays, in the corresponding passage, "with the fins that surround the bodythey swim."</p></body>
