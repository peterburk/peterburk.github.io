<div2 type="chapter" n="63" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 63. (63.)ÑNATURE OF THE EARTH.</head><p>Next comes the earth, on which alone of all parts of nature wehave bestowed the name that implies maternal veneration. It isappropriated to man as the heavens are to God.She receives us at our birth, nourishes us when born, andever afterwards supports us; lastly, embracing us in herbosom when we are rejected by the rest of nature, she thencovers us with especial tenderness; rendered sacred to us,inasmuch as she renders us sacred, bearing our monuments<pb n="1092" />and titles, continuing our names, and extending our memory,in opposition to the shortness of life. In our anger we imprecate heron those who are now no more<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>, as if we wereignorant that she is the only being who can never be angrywith man. The water passes into showers, is concreted intohail, swells into rivers, is precipitated in torrents; the air iscondensed into clouds, rages in squalls; but the earth, kind,mild, and indulgent as she is, and always ministering to thewants of mortals, how many things do we compel her toproduce spontaneously! What odours and flowers, nutritivejuices, forms and colours! With what good faith does sherender back all that has been entrusted to her! It is thevital spirit which must bear the blame of producing noxiousanimals; for the earth is constrained to receive the seeds ofthem, and to support them when they are produced. Thefault lies in the evil nature which generates them. Theearth will no longer harbour a serpent after it has attackedany one<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>, and thus she even demands punishment in thename of those who are indifferent about it themselves<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>. Shepours forth a profusion of medicinal plants, and is alwaysproducing something for the use of man. We may evensuppose, that it is out of compassion to us that she has ordainedcertain substances to be poisonous, in order that whenwe are weary of life, hunger, a mode of death the most foreignto the kind disposition of the earth<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, might not consume usby a slow decay, that precipices might not lacerate ourmangled bodies, that the unseemly punishment of the haltermay not torture us, by stopping the breath of one who seeks<pb n="1093" />his own destruction, or that we may not seek our death inthe ocean, and become food for our graves, or that our bodiesmay not be gashed by steel. On this account it is that nature has produced a substance which is very easily taken, andby which life is extinguished, the body remaining undefiledand retaining all its blood, and only causing a degree ofthirst. And when it is destroyed by this means, neitherbird nor beast will touch the body, but he who has perishedby his own hands is reserved for the earth.</p><p>But it must be acknowledged, that everything which theearth has produced, as a remedy for our evils, we have converted into the poison of our lives. For do we not use iron,which we cannot do without, for this purpose? But althoughthis cause of mischief has been produced, we ought not tocomplain; we ought not to be ungrateful to this one part ofnature<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>. How many luxuries and how many insults doesshe not bear for us! She is cast into the sea, and, in orderthat we may introduce seas into her bosom, she is washedaway by the waves. She is continually tortured for her iron, hertimber, stone, fire, corn, and is even much more subservientto our luxuries than to our mere support. What indeed sheendures on her surface might be tolerated, but we penetratealso into her bowels, digging out the veins of gold and silver,and the ores of copper and lead; we also search for gems andcertain small pebbles, driving our trenches to a great depth.We tear out her entrails in order to extract the gems withwhich we may load our fingers. How many hands are worndown that one little joint may be ornamented! If the infernal regionsreally existed, certainly these burrows of avarice and luxury wouldhave penetrated into them. And trulywe wonder that this same earth should have produced anything noxious!But, I suppose, the savage beasts protecther and keep off our sacrilegious hands<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>. For do we not digamong serpents and handle poisonous plants along with thoseveins of gold? But the Goddess shows herself more propitious to us,inasmuch as all this wealth ends in crimes,<pb n="1094" />slaughter, and war, and that, while we drench her with ourblood, we cover her with unburied bones; and being coveredwith these and her anger being thus appeased, she concealsthe crimes of mortals<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>. I consider the ignorance of hernature as one of the evil effects of an ungrateful mind.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We have an example in Martial, v. 34. 9, of the imprecation whichhas been common in all ages:<lb />Mollia nec rigidus cespes tegat ossa, nec illi<lb />Terra gravis fueris;<lb />and in Seneca's Hippolytus, <hi rend="ital">sub finem:</hi><lb />.....istam terra defossam premat,<lb />Gravisque tellus impio capiti incubet.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The author refers to this opinion, xxix. 23, when describing the effectsof venomous animals.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">inertium; "ultione abstinentium," as explained by Alexandre, inLemaire, i. 367.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Qued mortis genus a terr¾ meritis et benignitate valde abhorret."Hardouin, in Lemaire, i. 367.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Terra, inquit, sola est, e quatuor natur¾ partibus siveelementis, adversus quam ingrati simus."
