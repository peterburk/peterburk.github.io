This plant also is taken, in doses of twodenarii, in wine.<pb n="5125" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Fée thinks that there is an error in the name, and that it is the "personata" that is here spoken of, the plant already mentioned in c. 58 ofthis Book. Hardouin identifies it with the Tussilago petasites—the Butter-burr, according to Nemnich—but apparently without any sufficient authority.</p></body>
