WHAT JUICES ARE NATURALLY THE COLDEST OF ALL.</head><p>I am not surprised, then, that for these many ages therehave been invented almost innumerable varieties of artificialwines, of which I shall now make some mention; they are allof them employed for medicinal purposes. We have alreadystated in a former Book how omphacium,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> which is used forunguents, is made. The liquor known as "Ïnanthinum" ismade from the wild vine,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> two pounds of the flowers of whichare steeped in a cadus of must, and are then changed at theend of thirty days. In addition to this, the root and the<pb n="3256" />husks of the grapes are employed in dressing leather. Thegrapes, too, a little after the blossom has gone off, are singularly efficacious as a specific for cooling the feverish heat ofthe body in certain maladies, being, it is said, of a nature remarkable for extreme coldness. A portion of these grapeswither away, in consequence of the heat, before the rest,which are thence called solstitial<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> grapes; indeed, the wholeof them never attain maturity; if one of these grapes, inan unripe state, is given to a barn-door fowl to eat, it is productive of a dislike to grapes for the future.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">B. xii. c. 61.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "labrusca." "Înanthinum" means "made of vine flowers." Thewild vine is not a distinct species from the cultivated vine: it is only avariety of it, known in botany as the Vitis silvestris labrusca of Tournefort.FŽe thinks that as the must could only be used in autumn, when the wildvine was not flowering, the flowers of it must have been dried.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Solstitiales."
