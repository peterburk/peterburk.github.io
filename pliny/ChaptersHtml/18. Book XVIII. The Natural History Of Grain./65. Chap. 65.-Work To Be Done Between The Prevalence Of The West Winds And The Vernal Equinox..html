<div2 type="chapter" n="65" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 65.—WORK TO BE DONE BETWEEN THE PREVALENCE OFTHE WEST WINDS AND THE VERNAL EQUINOX.</head><p>Between the prevalence of the west winds and the vernalequinox, the fourteenth day before<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> the calends of March,according to Cæsar, announces three days of changeable weather;the same is the case, too, with the eighth<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> before the calendsof March, at the first appearance of the swallow, Arcturusrising on the evening of the next day. Cæsar has observed,that the same takes place on the third<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> before the nones ofMarch, at the rising of Cancer; and most authorities say the samewith reference to the emersion of the Vintager.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> On the eighth<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>before the ides of March, the northern limb of Pisces<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> rises,and on the next day Orion, at which period also, in Attica, theKite is first seen. Cæsar has noted, too, the setting of Scorpioon the ides of March,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> a day that was so fatal to him; and onthe fifteenth<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> before the calends of April, the Kite appears inItaly. On the twelfth<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> before the calends of April, the Horsesets in the morning.</p><p>This interval of time is a period of extreme activity for theagriculturist, and affords him a great number of occupations,in reference to which, however, he is extremely liable to be deceived. He is summoned to the commencement of theselabours, not upon the day on which the west winds ought tobegin, but upon the day on which they really do begin, to blow.This moment then must be looked for with the most carefulattention, as it is a signal which the Deity has vouchsafed usin this month, attended with no doubts or equivocations, ifonly looked for with scrupulous care. We have already statedin the Second Book,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> the quarter in which this wind blows,and the exact point from which it comes, and before long weshall have occasion to speak of it again still more in detail.</p><p>In the mean time, however, setting out from the day, what-<pb n="4085" />ever it may happen to be, on which the west winds begin toprevail (for it is not always on the seventh before the ides ofFebruary<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> that they do begin), whether, in fact, they beginto blow before the usual time, as is the case with an earlyspring, or whether after, which generally happens when thewinter is prolonged—there are subjects innumerable to engagethe attention of the agriculturist, and those, of course, shouldbe the first attended to, which will admit of no delay. Threemonth wheat must now be sown, the vine pruned in the waywe have already<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> described, the olive carefully attended to,fruit-trees put in and grafted, vineyards cleaned and hoed,seedlings laid out, and replaced in the nursery by others, thereed, the willow, and the broom planted and lopped, and theelm, the poplar, and the plane planted in manner already mentioned. At this period, also, the crops of corn ought to beweeded,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> and the winter kinds, spelt more particularly, wellhoed. In doing this, there is a certain rule to be observed, theproper moment being when four blades have made their appearance, andwith the bean this should never be done until threeleaves have appeared above ground; even then, however, it is abetter plan to clean them only with a slight hoeing, in preferenceto digging up the ground—but in no case should they ever betouched the first fifteen days of their blossom. Barley mustnever be hoed except when it is quite dry: take care, too, tohave all the pruning done by the vernal equinox. Four menwill be sufficient for pruning a jugerum of vineyard, and eachhand will be able to train fifteen vines to their trees.<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span></p><p>At this period, too, attention should be paid to the gardensand rose-beds, subjects which will be separately treated of insucceeding Books; due care should be given to ornamentalgardening as well. It is now, too, the very best time formaking ditches. The ground should now be opened for futurepurposes, as we find recommended by Virgil<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> in particular,in order that the sun may thoroughly warm the clods. It is apiece of even more sound advice, which recommends us toplough no lands in the middle of spring but those of middlingquality; for if this is done with a rich soil, weeds will besure to spring up in the furrows immediately; and if, on the<pb n="4086" />other hand, it is a thin, meagre land, as soon as the heat comeson, it will be dried up, and so lose all the moisture whichshould be reserved to nourish the seed when sown. It is a muchbetter plan, beyond a doubt, to plough such soils as these inautumn.</p><p>Cato<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> lays down the following rules for the operations ofspring. "Ditches," he says, "should be dug in the seed-plots, vinesshould be grafted, and the elm, the fig, the olive,and other fruit-trees planted in dense and humid soils. Suchmeadows<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> as are not irrigated, must be manured in a drymoon, protected from the western blasts, and carefully cleaned;noxious weeds must be rooted up, fig-trees cleared, new seed-plots made, and the old ones dressed: all this should be donebefore you begin to hoe the vineyard. When the pear is inblossom, too, you should begin to plough, where it is a meagre,gravelly soil. When you have done all this, you may ploughthe more heavy, watery soils, doing this the last of all."</p><p>The proper time for ploughing, then,<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> is denoted by thesetwo signs, the earliest fruit of the lentisk<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> making itsappearance, and the blossoming of the pear. There is a third sign,however, as well, the flowering of the squill among the bulbous,<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span>and of the narcissus among the garland, plants. Forboth the squill and the narcissus, as well as the lentisk, flowerthree times, denoting by their first flowering the first periodfor ploughing, by the second flowering the second, and by thethird flowering the last; in this way it is that one thing affordshints for another. There is one precaution, too, that is by nomeans the least important among them all, not to let ivy touchthe bean while in blossom; for at this period the ivy is noxious<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span>to it, and most baneful in its effects. Some plants, again,afford certain signs which bear reference more particularly tothemselves, the fig for instance; when a few leaves only arefound shooting from the summit, like a cup in shape, then it ismore particularly that the fig-tree should be planted.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Sixteenth of February.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Twenty-second of February.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Fifth of March.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">On the fifth of March, Ovid says, Fasti, iii. 1. 407.
