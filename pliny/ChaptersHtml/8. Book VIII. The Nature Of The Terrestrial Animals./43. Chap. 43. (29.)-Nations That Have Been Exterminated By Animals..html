(29.)—NATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN EXTERMINATED BY ANIMALS.</head><p>We have accounts, too, no less remarkable, in reference evento the most contemptible of animals. M. Varro informs us,that a town in Spain was undermined by rabbits, and one inThessaly, by mice; that the inhabitants of a district inGaul were driven from their country by frogs,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and a placein Africa by locusts;<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> that the inhabitants of Gyarus,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>one of the Cyclades, were driven away by mice;<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and theAmunclæ, in Italy, by serpents. There is a vast desert tracton this side of the Æthiopian Cynamolgi,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> the inhabitants ofwhich were exterminated by scorpions and venomous ants.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span><pb n="2296" />and Theophrastus informs us, that the people of Rhœteum<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>were driven away by scolopendræ.<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> But we must now returnto the other kinds of wild beasts.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Other instances are mentioned by Diodorus Siculus, B. iii. Justin, B.xv. c. 2, and Ælian, Hist. Anim. B. xvii. c. 41.—B. Showers of frogsare a thing not unknown in England even. They are probably caused bywhirlwinds acting upon waters which are the haunt of these animals.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The ravages of locusts have been known in all ages; their destructiveeffects in Egypt and Judea, have formed the subject of a very elaboratedissertation by Bochart, in his work on the "Animals of Scripture," Parti. B. iv. c. 3 and 4.—B.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Used as a place of banishment by the Romans.

There has been much discussion as to the word hereemployed by Pliny, and the animal which he intends to designate. Thesolipugus, solpugus, solipuga, or solipunga, probably different names ofthe same animal, is mentioned by various writers; among others, by Lucan,Phars. B. ix. 1. 837; Diodorus Siculus, B. iii.; Strabo, B. xvi.; and Ælian,Hist. Anim. B. xvii. c. 40. It is again referred to in B. xxix. c. 16. Thedescription given is, however, too indefinite to enable us to identify it withany known animal; it would almost seem to indicate something betweenthe spider and the ant.—B. We still hear in modern times of the venomousand destructive nature of the red ants on the coast of Guinea; and it is notimprobable that it is to these that Pliny alludes.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. v. c. 33.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is mentioned by Ælian, Anim.
