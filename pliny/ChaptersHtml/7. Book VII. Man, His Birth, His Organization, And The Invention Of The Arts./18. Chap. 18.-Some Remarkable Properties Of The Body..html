The deadbodies of men float upon the back, those of women with the<pb n="2159" />face downwards; as if, even after death, nature were desirousof sparing their modesty.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span></p><p>(18.) We find it stated, that there are some men whosebones are solid, and devoid of marrow,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and that one mark ofsuch persons is the fact that they are never thirsty, and emitno perspiration. At the same time, we know that by the exercise of a resolute determination, any one may resist thefeeling of thirst; a fact which was especially exemplified in thecase of Julius Viator, a Roman of equestrian rank, but by birthone of the Vocontii, a nation on terms of alliance with us.Having, in his youth, been attacked by dropsy, and forbiddenthe use of liquids by his physicians,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> use with him became asecond nature, and so, in his old age, he never took any drinkat all. Other persons also, have, by the exercise of a strongdetermination, laid similar restraints upon themselves.</p><p>(19.) It is said that Crassus, the grandfather of Crassus, whowas slain by the Parthians, was never known to laugh; fromwhich circumstance he obtained the name of Agelastus.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> Thereare other persons again, who have never been seen to weep.Socrates, who was so famous for his wisdom, always appearedwith the same countenance, and was never known to appeareither more gay or more sad than ordinary. This even tenorof the mind, however, sometimes degenerates into a sort ofharshness, and a rigorous and inflexible sternness of nature,entirely effacing all the human affections. The Greeks, amongwhom there have been many persons of this description, are in<pb n="2160" />the habit of calling them <foreign lang="greek">)Apaqei=s.</foreign><span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> A very remarkablething, too, is the fact, that among these persons are to be foundsome of the greatest masters of philosophy. Diogenes theCynic, for instance, Pyrrho, Heraclitus, and Timon, which lastallowed himself to be so entirely carried away by this spirit,as to become a hater of all mankind. Less important peculiarities of nature, again, are to be observed in many persons;Antonia,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> for instance, the wife of Drusus, was never knownto expectorate; and Pomponius, the poet, a man of consularrank, was never troubled with eructation. Those rare instancesof men,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> whose bones are naturally solid and without marrow,are known to us as men "of horn."<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is incorrect; the human body, after death, does not float untildecomposition has commenced, when it becomes more or less buoyant, inconsequence of the formation of gases, which partially distend the cavities;but we do not observe any difference in the two sexes in this respect.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This statement is altogether incorrect.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The total abstinence from liquids in dropsy, was a point much insistedupon by medical practitioners, even in modern times; but it is now generally conceived to have been derived from a false theory, and not to beessential to the cure of the disease, while it imposes upon the patient a mostsevere privation. A moderate use of fluids is even favourable to the operation of the remedies that are employed in this disease.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From the Greek <foreign lang="greek">a)gelasto)s,</foreign> "one who does not laugh." Cicero refers to this peculiarity in the character of Crassus, in his treatise De Finibus, B. v. c. 92; and in the Tusc. Quest. B. iii. c. 3, he informs us, on theauthority of Lucilius, that Crassus never laughed but once in his life.ÑB.And then, on seeing a donkey eating thistles; upon which he exclaimed,"Similem habent labia lactucam," "Like lips, like lettuce."</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Without passion;" equivalent to our English word "apathetical."ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The daughter of M.

She was the mother of Germanicus C¾sar, and the grandmother of the emperor Caligula, whom shelived to see on the throne, and who is supposed to have hastened her death.She was celebrated for her beauty and chastity-a rare virtue in thosedays.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny, B. xxxi. c. 45. says, that this state of the bones is found infishermen, from their being exposed to the action of the sea and salt water;but both the fact and the supposed cause are without foundation.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Cornei."</p></body>
