<div2 type="chapter" n="33" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 33.—THE USES OF SEA-WATER. THE ADVANTAGES OFA SEA-VOYAGE.</head><p>Sea-water also is employed in a similar manner for the cureof diseases. It is used, made hot, for the cure of pains in thesinews, for reuniting fractured bones, and for its desiccativeaction upon the body: for which last purpose, it is also usedcold. There are numerous other medicinal resources derivedfrom the sea; the benefit of a sea-voyage, more particularly,in cases of phthisis, as already<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> mentioned, and where patientsare suffering from hæmoptosis, as lately experienced, in ourown memory, by Annæus Gallio,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> at the close of his consulship:<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> for it is not for the purpose of visiting the country, thatpeople so often travel to Egypt, but in order to secure thebeneficial results arising from a long sea-voyage. Indeed, thevery sea-sickness that is caused by the rocking of the vesselto and fro, is good for many affections of the head, eyes, andchest, all those cases, in fact, in which the patient is recommended to drink an infusion of hellebore. Medical men con-sider sea-water, employed by itself,' highly efficacious for thedispersion of tumours, and, boiled with barley-meal, for thesuccessful treatment of imposthumes of the parotid glands: itis used also as an ingredient in plasters, white plasters moreparticularly, and for emollient<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> poultices. Sea-water is verygood, too, employed as a shower-bath; and it is taken internally, though not without<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> injury to the stomach, both as a<pb n="5497" />purgative and as an expellent, by vomit and by alvine evacuation, of black bile<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> or coagulated blood, as the case may be.</p><p>Some authorities prescribe it, taken internally, for quartanfevers, as also for tenesmus and diseases of the joints; purposes for which it is kept a considerable time, to mellow withage, and so lose its noxious<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> properties. Some, again, are forboiling it, but in all cases it is recommended to be taken fromout at sea, and untainted with the mixture of fresh water, anemetic also being taken before using it. When used in thismanner, vinegar or wine is generally mixed with the water.Those who give it unmixed, recommend radishes with oxymelto be eaten upon it, in order to provoke vomiting. Sea-water,made hot, is used also as an injection; and there is nothing inexistence preferred to it as a fomentation for swellings of thetestes, or for chilblains before they ulcerate. It is similarlyemployed, also, for the cure of prurigo, itch-scab, and lichens.Lice and other foul vermin of the head, are removed by theapplication of sea-water, and lividities of the skin are restoredto their natural colour; it being a remarkably good plan, insuch cases, after applying the sea-water, to foment the partswith hot vinegar.</p><p>It is generally considered, too, that sea-water is highlyeffcacious for the stings of venomous insects, those of the pha-langium and scorpion, for example, and as an antidote to thepoisonous secretions of the asp, known as the "ptyas;"<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> in allwhich cases it is employed hot. Fumigations are also made ofit, with vinegar, for the cure of head-ache; and, used warm asat injection, it allays griping pains in the bowels and cholera.Things that have been heated in sea-water are longer thanordinary in cooling. A sea-water bath is an excellent corrective for swelling<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> of the bosoms in females, affections ofthe thoracic organs, and ermaciation of the body. The steamalso of sea-water boiled with vinegar, is used for the removalof hardness of hearing and head-ache. An application ofsea-water very expeditiously removes rust upon iron; it is<pb n="5498" />curative also of scab in sheep, and imparts additional softnessto the wool.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. xxiv. c. 19, and B. xxviii. c. 14.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">An elder brother of the philosopher Seneca.
