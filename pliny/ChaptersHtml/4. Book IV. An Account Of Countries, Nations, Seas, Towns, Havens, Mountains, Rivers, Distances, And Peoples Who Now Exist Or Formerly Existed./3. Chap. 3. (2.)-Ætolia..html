(2.)—ÆTOLIA.</head><p>The peoples of Ætolia are the Athamanes<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>, the Tymphæi<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>,the Ephyri<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>, the Ænienses, the Perrhæbi<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, theDolopes<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>, theMaraces, and the Atraces<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>, in whose territory rises the riverAtrax, which flows into the Ionian Sea. Calydon<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> is a cityof Ætolia, situate at a distance of seven miles from the sea,and near the banks of the river Evenus<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>. We then come toMacynia<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>, and Molycria, behind which lie Mounts Chalcis<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>and Taphiassus. On the coast again, there is the promontoryof Antirrhium<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>, off which is the mouth of the CorinthianGulf, which flows in and separates Ætolia from the Peloponnesus,being less<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> than one mile in width. The promontorywhich faces it on the opposite side is called Rhion<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>. Thetowns of Ætolia, however, on the Corinthian Gulf areNaupactus<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> and Pylene<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>; and, more inland, Pleuronand Hali-<pb n="1276" />cyrna<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span>. The most famous mountains are Tomarus, in thedistrict of Dodona, Crania<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> in Ambracia, Aracynthus<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> inAcarnania, and Acanthon<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span>, Panætolium<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span>, and Macynium<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span>, inÆtolia.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pouqueville says that Athamania occupied the localities now knownas Djoumerca and Radovitch. It properly belonged to Epirus, and Plinymakes a mistake in considering it as a part of Ætolia.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">According to Pouqueville the ruins of Tymphæa are to be seen nearthe village of Paliouri, four miles from Janina.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ephyre, a town of the Agreei, is also mentioned by Strabo, butnothing whatever is known of it.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The main body of the Perrhæbi were a people of Thessaly.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Dolopia, now called Anovlachia, was properly reckoned part ofEpirus.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">They are probably not the same people as the inhabitants of Atrax inThessaly, which will be found mentioned in the 15th Chapter of thisBook.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The most famous city of Ætolia in its day, and the residence ofŒneus, father of Meleager and Tydeus, and grandfather of Diomedes.The greater part of its inhabitants were removed by Augustus to his newcity of Nicopolis. Leake supposes its ruins to be those seen by him atKurt-Aga, to the east of the river Evenus.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called the Fidaris.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pouqueville supposes the site of Macynia to have been that of themodern Koukio-Castron, and that of Molycria the present Manaloudi.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably the present Varassova; there was a town called Chalcis,or Hypochalcis, at its foot. The present Kaki-Skala was probably themountain of Taphiassus.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Opposite the Promontory of Rhium, at the entrance of theCorinthian Gulf. It is now called the Castle of Roumelia, or thePunta of theDardanelles of Roum Ili.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Leake and Dodwell make it a mile and a half.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or Rhium. It is now called the Castle of the Morea.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The modern Enebatché or Lepanto; whence the Corinthian Gulftakes its modern name.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Proschium was built at a later period on the site of Pylene. Its siteappears to be unknown. The modern Kyra-tis-Irinis is thought tooccupy the site of Pleuron.</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Leake supposes some ruins between Kurt-aga, the site of Chalcedon,and the east end of the Lagoon of Missolonghi, to be the remains ofHalicyrna.</p><p><span id="note_17"><a href="#ref_17">17. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Leake supposes it to be identical with the high mountain now calledKelberini. Others again identify it with Gribovo.</p><p><span id="note_18"><a href="#ref_18">18. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny erroneously places this mountain in Acarnania. It was a rangeof Ætolia, now called Zygos.</p><p><span id="note_19"><a href="#ref_19">19. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Perhaps the modern Djourmerca.</p><p><span id="note_20"><a href="#ref_20">20. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Either the present Plocopari, or perhaps, more probably, Viena.</p><p><span id="note_21"><a href="#ref_21">21. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A part of Mount Taphiassus. It is mentioned only by Pliny.</p></body>
