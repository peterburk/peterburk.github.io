<div2 type="chapter" n="3" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 3. (3.)ÑWHEN SHIELDS WERE FIRST INVENTED WITHPORTRAITS UPON THEM; AND WHEN THEY WERE FIRST ERECTEDIN PUBLIC.</head><p>So far as I can learn, Appius Claudius, who was consulwith P. Servilius, in the year of the City, 259, was the first todedicate shields<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> in honour of his own family in a sacred orpublic place.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> For he placed representations of his ancestorsin the Temple of Bellona, and desired that they might beerected in an elevated spot, so as to be seen, and the inscriptionsreciting their honours read. A truly graceful device;more particularly when a multitude of children, representedby so many tiny figures, displays those germs, as it were,which are destined to continue the line: shields such as these,no one can look at without a feeling of pleasure and livelyinterest.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Clypei." These were shields or escutcheons of metal, with the featuresof the deceased person represented either in painting or in relief.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hardouin informs us that there are some Greek inscriptions given byGruter, p. 441, and p. 476, from which it appears that public festivalswere celebrated on occasions of this kind.ÑB.</p></body>
