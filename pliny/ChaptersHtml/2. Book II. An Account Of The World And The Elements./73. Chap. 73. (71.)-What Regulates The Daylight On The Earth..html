<div2 type="chapter" n="73" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 73. (71.)ÑWHAT REGULATES THE DAYLIGHT ON THEEARTH.</head><p>Hence it is that there is not any one night and day the same,in all parts of the earth, at the same time; the intervention ofthe globe producing night, and its turning round producingday<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>. This is known by various observations. In Africa andin Spain it is made evident by the Towers of Hannibal<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>, and inAsia by the beacons, which, in consequence of their dread ofpirates, the people erected for their protection; for it has beenfrequently observed, that the signals, which were lighted atthe sixth hour of the day, were seen at the third hour of thenight by those who were the most remote<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>. Philonides, a<pb n="1106" />courier of the above-mentioned Alexander, went from Sicyonto Elis, a distance of 1200 stadia, in nine hours, while heseldom returned until the third hour of the night, althoughthe road was down-hill<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>. The reason is, that, in going, hefollowed the course of the sun, while on his return, in theopposite direction, he met the sun and left it behind him.For the same reason it is, that those who sail to the west,even on the shortest day, compensate for the difficulty ofsailing in the night and go farther<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>, because they sail in thesame direction with the sun.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The terms employed in the original are "oppositu" and "ambitu."Alexandre's explanation of the first is, "quum globi terraquei crassitudointerposita solis arcet radios;" and of the second, "quum nostra hujusglobi pars a sole ambitur." Lemaire, i. 389.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">One of these towers is mentioned by Livy, xxxiii. 48; it is said tohave been situated between Acholla and Thapsus, on the sea-coast.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hardouin, according to his usual custom, employs all his learningand ingenuity to give a plausible explanation of this passage. Alexandre,as it must be confessed, with but too much reason, remarks, "Frustradesudavit Harduinus ut sanum aliquem sensum ex illis Plinii deliramentis excuteret." He correctly refers the interval of time, which wassaid to occur between these signals, not to any astronomical cause, but tothe necessary delay which took place in the transmission of them. Heconcludes, "Sed ad cursum solis hoc referre, dementi¾ est. Nam ut tantahorarum differentia intersit, si moram omnem in speculandis actransmittendis signis sustuleris, necesse erit observatores illosultimos 135gradibus, id est, sesquidimidio hemisph¾rio, a primis distare turribus.Recte igitur incredibilem Plinii credulitatem ludibriovertit Baylius inDictionario suo." Lemaire, i. 389.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The distance, as here stated, is about 150 miles, which he is said tohave performed in nine hours, but that the same distance, in returning,required fifteen hours. We have here, as on the former occasion, a noteof Hardouin's to elucidate the statement of the author. On this Alexandre observes, "Optime; sed in tam parva locorum distantia, Elidis etSicyonis horologia vix quinque unius hore sexagesimis differre poterant;quare eunti ac redeunti ne discrimen quidem quadrantis hor¾ intererat.Ineptos igitur auctores sequitur hoc quoque loco Plinius." Lemaire, i.390, 391.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Vincunt spatia nocturn¾ navigationis." This expression wouldappear to imply, that the author conceived some physical difficultyin sailing during the night, and so it seems to be understood byAlexandre;vide not. <hi rend="ital">in loco.</hi></p></body>
