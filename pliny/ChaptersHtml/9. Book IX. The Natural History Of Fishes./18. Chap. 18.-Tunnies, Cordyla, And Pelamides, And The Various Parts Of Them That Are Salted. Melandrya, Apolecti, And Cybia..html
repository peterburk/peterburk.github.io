MELANDRYA, APOLECTI, AND CYBIA.</head><p>The male tunny has no ventral fin;<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> these fish enter theEuxine in large bodies from the main<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> sea, in the spring, andwill spawn nowhere else. The young ones, which in autumnaccompany the females to the open sea, are known as "cordyla."<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> In the spring they are called "pelamides,"<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> from<foreign lang="greek">phlo\s,</foreign> the Greek for "mud," and after they are a year old,"thynni." When this fish is cut up into pieces, the neck,the belly, and the throat,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> are the most esteemed parts; butthey must be eaten only when they are quite fresh, and eventhen they cause severe fits of flatulence; the other parts; withthe flesh entire, are preserved in salt. Those pieces, whichbear a resemblance to an oaken board, have thence receivedthe name of "melandrya."<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> The least esteemed among theseparts are those which are the nearest to the tail, because theyhave no fat upon them; while those parts are considered themost delicate, which lie nearest the neck;<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> in other fishes,<pb n="2386" />however, the parts about the tail have the most nutriment<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> inthem. The pelamides are cut up into small sections, knownas "apolecti;"<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> and these again are divided into cubicalpieces, which are thence called "cybia."<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Although taken primarily from Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. v. c. 9, asCuvier observes, this assertion is incorrect, as the male does not in any waydiffer from the female in the conformation of the fins. Pliny, however, hasexaggerated the statement of Aristotle, who only says, that the femalediffers from the male in having a little fin under the belly, which the malehas not; and not that the male has no ventral fin whatever.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Magno mari;" meaning, no doubt, the Mediterranean.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. vi. c. 17.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "mud-fish," either from being born in mud, as Festus says, orfrom their concealing themselves in it.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Clidio." The "clidion," or "clidium," was the part of the fishwhich extended, as Festus says, from the two shoulders (armos) to thebreast. The "claviculæ" were thus called by the Greek physicians.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Greeks called the inner part, or black-coloured heart of the oak,<foreign lang="greek">me/lan druo\s,</foreign> whence the present name. Athenæus, B. vi. speaks, fthe choice parts cut from the orcyni, large tunnies, which were taken inthe straits of Gades.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Faucibus." Cuvier observes, that modern experience has confirmed what Pliny says, as to the difference of flavour in these various parts of thetunny. He refers to Cetti, <hi rend="ital">Ist. Nat. di Sardegna,</hi> vol. iii. p. 137.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Exercitatissima." "In greatest request, as being most stirred andexercised," is the translation given by Holland; while Littré renders it"mieux nourries," "best nourished." According to the general notion inthis country, the part about the tail is reckoned inferior, and anything butthe "best nourished." It is doubtful if "exercitatissima" is the correctreading; and if it is, its precise meaning has yet to be ascertained.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From the Greek <foreign lang="greek">a)po/lektoi,</foreign> "choice bits," or, as we should say,"tit-bits."</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From the Greek <foreign lang="greek">ku/bia.</foreign></p></body>
