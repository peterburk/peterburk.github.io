<div2 type="chapter" n="17" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 17. (14.)—MEDIA AND THE CASPIAN GATES.</head><p>Ecbatana,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> the capital of Media, was built<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> by king Seleucus,at a distance from Great Seleucia of seven hundred and fiftymiles, and twenty miles from the Caspian Gates. The remaining towns of the Medians are Phazaca, Aganzaga, andApamea,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> surnamed Rhagiane. The reason of these passesreceiving the name of "Gates," is the same that has beenstated above.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> The chain of mountains is suddenly broken bya passage of such extreme narrowness that, for a distance ofeight miles, a single chariot can barely find room to move along:the whole of this pass has been formed by artificial means.Both on the right hand and the left are overhanging rocks,which look as though they had been exposed to the action offire; and there is a tract of country, quite destitute of water,<pb n="2029" />twenty-eight miles in extent. This narrow pass, too, is rendered still more difficult by a liquid salt which oozes from therocks, and uniting in a single stream, makes its way along thepass. Besides this, it is frequented by such multitudes ofserpents, that the passage is quite impracticable except inwinter.</p><p>(15.) Joining up to Adiabene are the people formerly knownas the 'Carduchi,' now the Cordueni,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> in front of whom theriver Tigris flows: and next to them are the Pratitæ, entitledthe <hi rend="ital">Par Odon,</hi><span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> who hold possession of the Caspian Gates.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>On the other side<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> of these gates we come to the deserts<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> ofParthia and the mountain chain of Cithenus; and after that,the most pleasant locality of all Parthia, Choara<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> by name.Here were two cities of the Parthians, built in former times fortheir protection against the people of Media, Calliope,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> andIssatis, the last of which stood formerly<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> on a rock. Hecatompylos,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> the capital of Parthia, is distant from the CaspianGates one hundred and thirty-three miles. In such an effectualmanner is the kingdom of Parthia shut out by these passes.After leaving these gates we find the nation of the Caspii, extending as far as the shores of the Caspian, a race which hasgiven its name to these gates as well as to the sea: on the left<pb n="2030" />there is a mountainous district. Turning back<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> from thisnation to the river Cyrus, the distance is said to be two hundred and twenty miles; but if we go from that river as fardown as the Caspian Gates, the distance is seven hundreds<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>miles. In the itineraries of Alexander the Great these gateswere made the central or turning point in his expeditions;the distance from the Caspian Gates to the frontier of Indiabeing there set down as fifteen thousand six hundred andeighty<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> stadia, to the city of Bactra,<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> commonly called Zariaspa, three thousand seven hundred, and thence to the riverJaxartes<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> five thousand stadia.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A city of great magnitude, pleasantly situate near the foot of MountOrontes, in the northern part of Greater Media. Its original foundationwas attributed by Diodorus Siculus to Semiramis, and by Herodotus toDeioces. It was the capital of the Median kingdom, and afterwards thesummer residence of the Persian and Parthian kings. The genuine orthography of the name seems to be Agbatana. The ruins seen at the modernHamadan are generally supposed to represent those of the ancient Ecbatana; but it is most probable that at different times, if not contemporaneously, there were several cities of this name in Media.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny in this statement, as also in the distances which he here assignsto Ecbatana, is supposed to have confounded Ecbatana with Europus, nowVeramin, rebuilt by Seleucus Nicator.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This was a city in the vicinity of Rhagæ, which was distant about500 stadia from the Caspian Gates. It was built by the Greeks after theMacedonian conquest of Asia. The other places here mentioned do notappear to have been identified.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See the beginning of c. 12, p. 21.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This was the name of the wild tribes which occupied the high mountainous district between the great upland of Persia and the low plains ofMesopotamia. In addition to the name mentioned by Pliny, they werecalled Gordyæ, Cardaces, and Curtii. The present Kurds, inhabiting Kurdistan, are supposed to be descended from them.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Greek <foreign lang="greek">par' o(do\n,</foreign> "on the road"—meaning, probably, to theCaspian Gates. Hardouin says that the Pratitæ were so called from theGreek <foreign lang="greek">prati=tai,</foreign> "merchants."</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Although dwelling at a considerable distance, the custody of thesegates was delivered to them, Hardouin says, by the kings of Media.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">To the south-east of them.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Mentioned in c. 29 of the present Book.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or Choarene.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Its site is unknown; but it is mentioned by Appian as one of themany towns erected by Seleucus.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">By the use of the word "quondam," he implies that in his time itwas in ruins.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A place of considerable importance, which seems to have derived itsname from its "hundred gates." It was one of the capitals of the Arsacidan princes; but, extensive though it may have been, there is greatdoubt where it was situate, the distance recorded by ancient writers notcorresponding with any known ruins.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In a northern direction, along the western shores of the Caspian.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">According to Hardouin, Eratosthenes, as quoted by Strabo, makesthe distance 5060 stadia, or about 633 miles. He has, however, mistranslated the passage, which gives 5600 stadia, or 700 miles exactly,as stated by Pliny.</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or 1960 miles.</p><p><span id="note_17"><a href="#ref_17">17. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Bactra, Bactrum, or Bactrium, was one of the chief cities, if not thecapital, of the province of Bactriana. It was one of the most ancientcities in the world, and the modern Balkh is generally supposed to occupyits site. Strabo, as well as Pliny, evidently considers that Bactra andZareispa were the same place, while Appian distinguishes between thetwo, though he does not clearly state their relative positions.</p><p><span id="note_18"><a href="#ref_18">18. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The modern Syr-Daria, mentioned in c. 15.
