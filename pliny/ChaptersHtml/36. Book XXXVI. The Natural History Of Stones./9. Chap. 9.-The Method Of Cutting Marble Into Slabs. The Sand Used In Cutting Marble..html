<div2 type="chapter" n="9" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 9.—THE METHOD OF CUTTING MARBLE INTO SLABS. THESAND USED IN CUTTING MARBLE.</head><p>But whoever it was that first invented the art of thus cuttingmarble, and so multiplying the appliances of luxury, he displayedconsiderable ingenuity, though to little purpose. This<pb n="6326" />division, though apparently effected by the aid of iron, is inreality effected by sand; the saw acting only by pressing uponthe sand within a very fine cleft in the stone, as it is movedto and fro.</p><p>The<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> sand of Æthiopia is the most highly esteemed for thispurpose; for, to add to the trouble that is entailed, we haveto send to Æthiopia for the purpose of preparing our marble—aye,and as far as India even; whereas in former times, theseverity of the Roman manners thought it beneath them torepair thither in search of such costly things even as pearls!This Indian sand is held in the next highest degree of estimation,the Æthiopian being of a softer nature, and betteradapted for dividing the stone without leaving any roughnesson the surface; whereas the sand from India does not leave sosmooth a face upon it. Still, however, for polishing marble,we find it recommended<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> to rub it with Indian sand calcined.The sand of Naxos has the same defect; as also that fromCoptos, generally known as "Egyptian" sand.</p><p>The above were the several varieties of sand used by theancients in dividing marble. More recently, a sand has beendiscovered that is equally approved of for this purpose; in acertain creek of the Adriatic Sea, which is left dry at lowwater only; a thing that renders it not very easy to be found.At the present day, however, the fraudulent tendencies of ourworkers in marble have emboldened them to use any kind ofriver-sand for the purpose; a mischief which very few employersrightly appreciate. For, the coarser the sand, thewider is the division made in the stone, the greater the quantityof material consumed, and the more extensive the labourrequired for polishing the rough surface that is left; a resultof which is that the slabs lose so much more in thickness.For giving the last polish to marble,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> Thebaic stone<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> is consideredwell adapted, as also porous stone, or pumice, powderedfine.<pb n="6327" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ajasson says that his remarks on the choice of the sand for this purpose,are very judicious.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A recommendation worse than useless, Ajasson remarks.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">For this purpose, at the present day, granular corindon, or yellowemery, is used, as also a mixture composed of the oxides of lead and oftin; the substance being repeatedly moistened when applied.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See Chapters 13 and 43 of this Book.</p></body>
