(55.)—AN AUGURY DERIVED FROM EGGS BY AN EMPRESS.</head><p>And, what is even more singular still, eggs can be hatchedalso by a human being. Julia Augusta, when pregnant in<pb n="2536" />her early youth of Tiberius Cæsar, by Nero, was particularlydesirous that her offspring should be a son, and accordinglyemployed the following mode of divination, which was thenmuch in use among young women: she carried an egg in herbosom, taking care, whenever she was obliged to put it down,to give it to her nurse to warm in her own, that there mightbe no interruption in the heat: it is stated that the result promised by this mode of augury was not falsified.</p><p>It was perhaps from this circumstance, that the modern invention took its rise, of placing eggs in a warm spot and covering them with chaff, the heat being maintained by a moderatefire, while in the meantime a man is employed in turning them.By the adoption of this plan, the young, all of them, breakthe shell on a stated day. There is a story told of a breederof poultry, of such remarkable skill, that on seeing an egg hecould tell which hen had laid it. It is said also that when ahen has happened to die while sitting, the males have been seento take her place in turns, and perform all the other duties of abrood-hen, taking care in the meantime to abstain from crowing. But the most remarkable thing of all, is the sight of ahen, beneath which ducks' eggs have been put and hatched.—At first, she is unable to quite recognize the brood as her own,while in her anxiety she gives utterance to her clucking asshe doubtfully calls them; then at last she will stand at themargin of the pond, uttering her laments, while the ducklings, with Nature for their guide, are diving beneath the water.</p></div2></body>
