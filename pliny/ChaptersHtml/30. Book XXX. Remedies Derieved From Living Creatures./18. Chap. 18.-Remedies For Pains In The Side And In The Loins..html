<div2 type="chapter" n="18" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 18.â€”REMEDIES FOR PAINS IN THE SIDE AND IN THE LOINS.</head><p>For pains in the side, the heart of a hoopoe is highly esteemed; ashes, too, of burnt snails, that have been boiled ina ptisan, snails being sometimes applied in the form of a liniment, alone. Potions employed for this purpose have a sprinkling in them of the ashes of a mad dog's skull. For the cureof lumbago, the spotted lizard<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> from beyond seas is used:the head and intestines being first removed, the body is boiledin wine, with half a denarius of black poppy, and the decoction is taken in drink. Green lizards, also, are taken withthe food, the feet and head being first removed; or else threesnails are crushed, shells and all, and boiled with fifteen peppercorns in wine. The feet of an eagle are wrenched off in acontrary direction to the joint, and the right foot is attachedto the right side, the left foot to the left, according as thepains are situate. The miilepede,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> which we have spoken of<pb n="5441" />as being called the "oniscos," is a cure for these pains,taken, in doses of one denarius, in two cyathi of wine.The magicians recommend an earth-worm to be put in awooden dish, which has been split and mended with ironwire; which done, some water must be taken up with the dish,the worm drenched with it and buried in the spot fromwhich it was taken, and the water drunk from the dish.They assert, also, that this is a marvellously excellent cure forsciatica.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxix. c. 28.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or woodlouse.
