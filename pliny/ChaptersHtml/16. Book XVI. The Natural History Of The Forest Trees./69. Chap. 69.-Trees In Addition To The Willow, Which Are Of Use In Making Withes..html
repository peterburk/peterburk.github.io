It is not, however, because the willow isthe only tree that produces withes; for they may be procuredalso from the broom, the poplar, the elm, the blood-red cornel,the birch, and the reed itself when split, or else the leaves of thatplant, as we know to be the case in Liguria. The vine, also,will furnish them; the bramble, too, with the thorns removed, as well as the twisted hazel. It is a very singular thing,that a wood after it has been beaten and pounded should befound all the stronger for making withes, but such is a strikingpeculiarity that exists in the willow. The Greek red<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> willow issplit for this purpose: while the willow<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> of Ameria is whiterbut more brittle, for which reason it is used in an uncut state fortying. In Asia there are three varieties known of the willow;the black<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> willow, which is best adapted for making withes,the white willow, employed for various agricultural purposes,and a third, which is shorter than the others, and known asthe helix.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span></p><p>With us, also, there is the same number of denominationsgiven to as many varieties of the willow; one being known<pb n="3411" />as the viminal or purple willow,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> another as the nitelina,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>from its resemblance to the colour of the nitela, thinner inthe trunk than the preceding one, and the third as theGallic<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> kind, being the thinnest of them all.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">De Re Rust. c. 6.
