(55.)ÑTHE MANES, OR DEPARTED SPIRITS OF THE SOUL.</head><p>After burial come the different quiddities as to the existence ofthe Manes. All men, after their last day,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> return to what theywere before the first; and after death there is no more sensation left in the body or in the soul than there was before birth.But this same vanity of ours extends even to the future, andlyingly fashions to itself an existence even in the very moments which belong to death itself: at one time it has conferred upon us the immortality of the soul; at another transmigration; and at another it has given sensation to the shadesbelow, and paid divine honours to the departed spirit, thusmaking a kind of deity of him who has but just ceased to be aman. As if, indeed, the mode of breathing with man wasin any way different from that of other animals, and as if therewere not many other animals to be found whose life is longerthan that of man, and yet for whom no one ever presaged anything of a like immortality. For what is the actual substanceof the soul, when taken by itself? Of what material does itconsist? Where is the seat of its thoughts? How is it to<pb n="2219" />see, or hear, or how to touch? And then, of what use is it,or what can it avail, if it has not these faculties? Where,too, is its residence, and what vast multitudes of these soulsand spirits<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> must there be after the lapse of so many ages?But all these are the mere figments of childish ravings, and ofthat mortality which is so anxious never to cease to exist. Itis a similar piece of vanity, too, to preserve the dead bodies ofmen; just like the promise that he shall come to life again,which was made by Democritus;<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> who, however, never has cometo life again himself. Out upon it! What downright madness is it to suppose that life is to recommence after death! orindeed, what repose are we ever to enjoy when we have beenonce born, if the soul is to retain its consciousness in heaven,and the shades of the dead in the infernal regions? Thispleasing delusion, and this credulity, quite cancel that chiefgood of human nature, death, and, as it were, double themisery of him who is about to die, by anxiety as to what isto happen to him after it. And, indeed, if life really is agood, to whom can it be so to have once lived?</p><p>How much more easy, then, and how much more devoid ofall doubts, is it for each of us to put his trust in himself, andguided by our knowledge of what our state has been beforebirth, to assume that that after death will be the same.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He views the state after death in the same light as Democritus andEpicurus, utterly denying the immortality of the soul; though it cannotbe said that he looks upon life in the same cheerful, laissez-faire manner inwhich it was regarded by the latter of these philosophers.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hardouin remarks, that the ancients made a distinction between thesouls of the dead, and their spirits or shades, "umbr¾." The former weresupposed to remain on the earth, while the latter were removed either toElysium or to Tartarus, according to the character or actions of the deceased.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">According to Varro, Democritus directs, that the body shall not beburnt after death, hut preserved in honey; on which Varro remarks, howgreatly such a practice would tend to raise the price of that article.ÑB.</p></body>
