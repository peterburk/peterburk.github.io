<div2 type="chapter" n="59" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 59.—gypsum.</head><p>Gypsum<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> has a close affinity with limestone, and there arenumerous varieties of it. One kind is prepared from a calcined<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>stone, as in Syria, and at Thurii, for example. InCyprus and at Perrhæbia,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> gypsum is dug out of the earth,and at Tymphæ<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> it is found just below the level of the soil.The stone that is calcined for this purpose, ought to be verysimilar to alabastrites,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> or else of a grain like that of marble.In Syria, they select the hardest stones for the purpose, andcalcine them with cow-dung, to accelerate the process. Experiencehas proved, however, that the best plaster of all isthat prepared from specular-stone,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> or any other stone that issimilarly laminated. Gypsum, when moistened, must be usedimmediately, as it hardens with the greatest rapidity; itadmits, however, of being triturated over again, and so reducedto powder. It is very useful for pargetting, and has apleasing effect when used for ornamental figures and wreathsin buildings.</p><p>There is one remarkable fact connected with this substance;Caius Proculeius,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> an intimate friend of the Emperor Augustus,suffering from violent pains in the stomach, swallowed gypsum,and so put an end to his existence.<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The name now given to Sulphate of lime, including the varieties ofAlabaster and Selenite.
