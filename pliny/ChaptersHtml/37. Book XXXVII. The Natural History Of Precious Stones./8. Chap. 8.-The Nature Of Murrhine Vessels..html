<div2 type="chapter" n="8" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 8.ÑTHE NATURE OF MURRHINE VESSELS.</head><p>Murrhine vessels come from the East, in numerous localitiesof which, remarkable for nothing else, they are to be found.It is in the empire of the Parthians, more particularly, thatthey are met with, though those of the very finest qualitycome to us from Carmania.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> It is generally thought thatthese vessels are formed of a moist substance, which underground becomes solidified by heat.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> In size they never ex-<pb n="6394" />ceed a small waiter,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and, as to thickness, they rarely admit ofbeing used as drinking-cups, so large as those already<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> mentioned.The brightness of them is destitute of strength, andit may be said that they are rather shining than brilliant.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>But the chief merit of them is the great variety of theircolours, and the wreathed veins, which, every here and there,present shades of purple and white, with a mixture of the two;the purple gradually changing, as it were, to a fiery red, andthe milk-white assuming a ruddy hue. Some persons praisethe edges of these vessels more particularly, with a kind ofreflection in the colours, like those beheld in the rain-bow.Others, again, are more pleased with them when quite opaque,it being considered a demerit when they are at all transparent,or of a pallid hue. The appearance, too, of crystals<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> in themis highly prized, and of spots that look like warts; not prominent,but depressed, as we mostly see upon the human body.The perfume,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> too, of which they smell, is looked upon as anadditional recommendation.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. vi. cc. 27, 28, 32.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ajasson is of opinion that this passage bears reference to crystallization.Both he and Desfontaines see in the present Chapter a very exactdescription of Fluor spar; and there is certainly great difficulty in recognizing any affinity between murrhine vessels, as here described, and porcelain.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Abacus."</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In the preceding Chapter.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Meaning that they are semitransparent, Ajasson thinks. One greatcharacteristic of Fluor spar is its being subtranslucent.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This would appear to be the meaning here of "sales." See p. 396.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">One of the grounds, Ajasson says, on which may be based theopinion that they were artificial.</p></body>
