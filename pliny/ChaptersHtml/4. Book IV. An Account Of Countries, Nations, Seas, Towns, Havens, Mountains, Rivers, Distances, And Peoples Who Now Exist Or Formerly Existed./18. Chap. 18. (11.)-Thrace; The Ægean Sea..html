<div2 type="chapter" n="18" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 18. (11.)ÑTHRACE; THE ®GEAN SEA.</head><p>Thrace now follows, divided into fifty strategies<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>, and tobe reckoned among the most powerful nations of Europe.Among its peoples whom we ought not to omit to name arethe Denselet¾ and the Medi, dwelling upon the right bankof the Strymon, and joining up to the Bisalt¾ above<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>mentioned; on the left there are the Digerri and a number oftribes of the Bessi<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>, with various names, as far as the riverMestus<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, which winds around the foot of Mount Pan-<pb n="1303" />g¾um<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>, passing among the Elethi, the Diobessi<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>, theCarbilesi; and then the Brys¾, the Sap¾i, and the Odomanti.The territory of the Odrys¾<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> gives birth to the Hebrus<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>, itsbanks being inhabited by the Cabyleti, the Pyrogeri, theDrugeri, the C¾nici, the Hypsalti, the Beni, the Corpili,the Botti¾i, and the Edoni<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>. In the same district are also theSellet¾, the Priant¾, the Dolonc¾, the Thyni, and theGreater CÏlet¾, below Mount H¾mus, the Lesser at thefoot of Rhodope. Between these tribes runs the river Hebrus. We thencome to a town at the foot of Rhodope,first called Poneropolis<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>, afterwards Philippopolis<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> from thename of its founder, and now, from the peculiarity of itssituation, Trimontium<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>. To reach the summit of H¾musyou have to travel six<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> miles. The sides of it that look inthe opposite direction and slope towards the Ister are inhabited bythe MÏsi<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>, the Get¾, the Aorsi, the Gaud¾, andthe Clari¾; below them, are the Arr¾i Sarmat¾<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>, also calledArreat¾, the Scythians, and, about the shores of the Euxine,the Moriseni and the Sithonii, the forefathers of the poetOrpheus<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span>, dwell.<pb n="1304" /></p><p>Thus is Thrace bounded by the Ister on the north, by theEuxine, and the Propontis<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> on the east, and by the ®geanSea on the south; on the coast of which, after leaving theStrymon, we come in turn to Apollonia<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span>, Îsyma<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span>,Neapolis<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span>and Datos. In the interior is the colony of Philippi<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span>,distant from Dyrrhachium 325 miles; also Scotussa<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span>, thecity of Topiris, the mouth of the river Mestus<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span>, MountPang¾us, Heraclea<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span>, Olynthos<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span>, Abdera<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span>, afree city, thepeople of the Bistones<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span> and their Lake. Here was formerlythe city of Tirida, which struck such terror with its stablesof the horses<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span> of Diomedes. At the present day we findhere Dic¾a<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span>, Ismaron<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span>, the place where Parthenion stood,Phalesina, and Maronea<span id="ref_31"><a href="#note_31">[31]</a></span>, formerly called Orthagorea. We<pb n="1305" />then come to Mount Serrium<span id="ref_32"><a href="#note_32">[32]</a></span> and Zone<span id="ref_33"><a href="#note_33">[33]</a></span>, and then theplace called Doriscus<span id="ref_34"><a href="#note_34">[34]</a></span>, capable of containing ten thousandmen, for it was in bodies of ten thousand that Xerxes herenumbered his army. We then come to the mouth of theHebrus<span id="ref_35"><a href="#note_35">[35]</a></span>, the Port of Stentor, and the free town of ®nos<span id="ref_36"><a href="#note_36">[36]</a></span>,with the tomb there of Polydorus<span id="ref_37"><a href="#note_37">[37]</a></span>, the region formerly ofthe Cicones.</p><p>From Doriscus there is a winding coast as far as MacronTichos<span id="ref_38"><a href="#note_38">[38]</a></span>, or the "Long Wall," a distance of 122 miles;round Doriscus flows the river Melas, from which the Gulfof Melas<span id="ref_39"><a href="#note_39">[39]</a></span> receives its name. The towns are, Cypsela<span id="ref_40"><a href="#note_40">[40]</a></span>,Bisanthe<span id="ref_41"><a href="#note_41">[41]</a></span>, and Macron Tichos, already mentioned, so calledbecause a wall extends from that spot between the twoseas,Ñthat is to say, from the Propontis to the Gulf ofMelas, thus excluding the Chersonesus<span id="ref_42"><a href="#note_42">[42]</a></span>, which projectsbeyond it.</p><p>The other side of Thrace now begins, on the coast<span id="ref_43"><a href="#note_43">[43]</a></span>of the Euxine, where the river Ister discharges itself; andit is in this quarter perhaps that Thrace possesses the finestcities, Histropolis<span id="ref_44"><a href="#note_44">[44]</a></span>, namely, founded by the Milesians,<pb n="1306" />Tomi<span id="ref_45"><a href="#note_45">[45]</a></span>, and Callatis<span id="ref_46"><a href="#note_46">[46]</a></span>, formerly called Acervetis. It alsohad the cities of Heraclea and Bizone, which latter wasswallowed up by an earthquake; it now has Dionysopolis<span id="ref_47"><a href="#note_47">[47]</a></span>,formerly called Cruni, which is washed by the river Zyras.All this country was formerly possessed by the Scythians,surnamed Aroteres; their towns were, Aphrodisias, Libistos,Zygere, Rocobe, Eumenia, Parthenopolis, and Gerania<span id="ref_48"><a href="#note_48">[48]</a></span>,where a nation of Pigmies is said to have dwelt; the barbariansused to call them Cattuzi, and entertain a beliefthat they were put to flight by cranes. Upon the coast,proceeding from Dionysopolis, is Odessus<span id="ref_49"><a href="#note_49">[49]</a></span>, a city of theMilesians, the river Panysus<span id="ref_50"><a href="#note_50">[50]</a></span>, and the town of Tetranaulo-chus. Mount H¾mus, which, with its vast chain, overhangs the Euxine, had in former times upon its summitthe town of Arist¾um<span id="ref_51"><a href="#note_51">[51]</a></span>. At the present day there are uponthe coast Mesembria<span id="ref_52"><a href="#note_52">[52]</a></span>, and Anchialum<span id="ref_53"><a href="#note_53">[53]</a></span>, where Messa formerly stood. The region of Astice formerly had a towncalled Anthium; at the present day Apollonia<span id="ref_54"><a href="#note_54">[54]</a></span> occupiesits site. The rivers here are the Panisos, the Riras, theTearus, and the Orosines; there are also the towns ofThynias<span id="ref_55"><a href="#note_55">[55]</a></span>, Halmydessos<span id="ref_56"><a href="#note_56">[56]</a></span>, Develton<span id="ref_57"><a href="#note_57">[57]</a></span>, with itslake, now knownas Deultum, a colony of veterans, and Phinopolis, nearwhich last is the Bosporus<span id="ref_58"><a href="#note_58">[58]</a></span>. From the mouth of the Isterto the entrance of the Euxine, some writers have made to be<pb n="1307" />a distance of 555 miles; Agrippa, however, increases thelength by sixty miles. The distance thence to Macron Tichos,or the Long Wall, previously mentioned, is 150 miles; and,from it to the extremity of the Chersonesus, 125.</p><p>On leaving the Bosporus we come to the Gulf of Casthenes<span id="ref_59"><a href="#note_59">[59]</a></span>,and two harbours, the one called the Old Men'sHaven, and the other the Women's Haven. Next comesthe promontory of Chrysoceras<span id="ref_60"><a href="#note_60">[60]</a></span>, upon which is the town ofByzantium<span id="ref_61"><a href="#note_61">[61]</a></span>, a free state, formerly called Lygos, distant fromDyrrhachium 711 miles,Ñso great being the space of landthat intervenes between the Adriatic Sea and the Propontis.We next come to the rivers Bathynias and Pydaras<span id="ref_62"><a href="#note_62">[62]</a></span>, orAthyras, and the towns of Selymbria<span id="ref_63"><a href="#note_63">[63]</a></span> and Perinthus<span id="ref_64"><a href="#note_64">[64]</a></span>, whichjoin the mainland by a neck only 200 feet in width. In theinterior are Bizya<span id="ref_65"><a href="#note_65">[65]</a></span>, a citadel of the kings of Thrace, and hatedby the swallows, in consequence of the sacrilegious crimeof Tereus<span id="ref_66"><a href="#note_66">[66]</a></span>; the district called C¾nica<span id="ref_67"><a href="#note_67">[67]</a></span>, and the colony ofFlaviopolis, where formerly stood a town called C¾la. Then,at a distance of fifty miles from Bizya, we come to the colonyof Apros, distant from Philippi 180 miles. Upon the coastis the river Erginus<span id="ref_68"><a href="#note_68">[68]</a></span>; here formerly stood the town ofGanos<span id="ref_69"><a href="#note_69">[69]</a></span>; and Lysimachia<span id="ref_70"><a href="#note_70">[70]</a></span> in the Chersonesus is being nowgradually deserted.</p><p>At this spot there is another isthmus<span id="ref_71"><a href="#note_71">[71]</a></span>, similar in nameto the other<span id="ref_72"><a href="#note_72">[72]</a></span>, and of about equal width; and, in a manner<pb n="1308" />by no means dissimilar, two cities formerly stood on the shore,one on either side, Pactye on the side of the Propontis, andCardia<span id="ref_73"><a href="#note_73">[73]</a></span> on that of the Gulf of Melas, the latter deriving itsname from the shape<span id="ref_74"><a href="#note_74">[74]</a></span> which the land assumes. These, however,were afterwards united with Lysimachia<span id="ref_75"><a href="#note_75">[75]</a></span>, which standsat a distance of five miles from Macron Tichos. The Chersonesus formerly had, on the side of the Propontis, the townsof Tiristasis, Crithotes, and Cissa<span id="ref_76"><a href="#note_76">[76]</a></span>, on the banks of the river®gos<span id="ref_77"><a href="#note_77">[77]</a></span>; it now has, at a distance of twenty-two<span id="ref_78"><a href="#note_78">[78]</a></span> miles fromthe colony of Apros, Resistos, which stands opposite to thecolony of Parium. The Hellespont also, which separates,as we have already<span id="ref_79"><a href="#note_79">[79]</a></span> stated, Europe from Asia, by a channelseven stadia in width, has four cities facing each other,Callipolis<span id="ref_80"><a href="#note_80">[80]</a></span> and Sestos<span id="ref_81"><a href="#note_81">[81]</a></span> in Europe, and Lampsacus<span id="ref_82"><a href="#note_82">[82]</a></span> andAbydos<span id="ref_83"><a href="#note_83">[83]</a></span> in Asia. On the Chersonesus, there is the promontoryof Mastusia<span id="ref_84"><a href="#note_84">[84]</a></span>, lying opposite to Sigeum<span id="ref_85"><a href="#note_85">[85]</a></span>; uponone side of it stands the Cynossema<span id="ref_86"><a href="#note_86">[86]</a></span> (for so the tomb ofHecuba is called), the naval station<span id="ref_87"><a href="#note_87">[87]</a></span> of the Ach¾ans, and atower; and near it the shrine<span id="ref_88"><a href="#note_88">[88]</a></span> of Protesilas. On the ex-<pb n="1309" />treme front of the Chersonesus, which is called ®olium, thereis the city of El¾s. Advancing thence towards the Gulf ofMelas, we have the port of CÏlos<span id="ref_89"><a href="#note_89">[89]</a></span>, Panormus, and thenCardia, previously mentioned.</p><p>In this manner is the third great Gulf of Europe bounded.The mountains of Thrace, besides those already mentioned,are Edonus, Gigemoros, Meritus, and Melamphyllos; therivers are the Bargus and the Syrmus, which fall into theHebrus. The length of Macedonia, Thrace, and the Hellespont has beenalready<span id="ref_90"><a href="#note_90">[90]</a></span> mentioned; some writers, however, make it 720 miles,the breadth being 384.</p><p>What may be called a rock rather than an island, lyingbetween Tenos and Chios, has given its name to the ®geanSea; it has the name of ®x<span id="ref_91"><a href="#note_91">[91]</a></span> from its strong resemblanceto a goat, which is so called in Greek, and shoots precipitatelyfrom out of the middle of the sea. Those who are sailing towards theisle of Andros from Achaia, see this rock onthe left, boding no good, and warning them of its dangers.Part of the ®gean Sea bears the name of Myrtoan<span id="ref_92"><a href="#note_92">[92]</a></span>, beingso called from the small island [of Myrtos] which is seenas you sail towards Macedonia from Ger¾stus, not far fromCarystus<span id="ref_93"><a href="#note_93">[93]</a></span> in EubÏa. The Romans include all these seasunder two names,Ñthe Macedonian, in those parts where ittouches the coasts of Macedonia or Thrace, and the Grecianwhere it washes the shores of Greece The Greeks, however, divide theIonian Sea into the Sicilian and the CretanSeas, after the name of those islands; and they give thename of Icarian to that part which lies between Samos andMyconos. The gulfs which we have already mentioned,have given to these seas the rest of their names. Such,<pb n="1310" />then, are the seas and the various nations which are comprehended in the third great Gulf of Europe.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or pr¾fectures, as the Romans called them.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In the last Chapter.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">An extensive tribe occupying the country about the rivers Axius,Strymon, and Nestus or Mestus.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This river is now called the Mesto or Kara-Sou.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A range between the Strymon and the Nestus, now the Pangea orDespoto-Dagh.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably a canton or division of the Bessi.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The most powerful people of Thrace; dwelling on both sides of theArtiscus, and on the plain of the Hebrus.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now the Maritza.
