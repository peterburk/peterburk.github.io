<div2 type="chapter" n="5" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 5. (2.)—THE INSTINCTS OF FISHES.</head><p>The statements which Ovid has made as to the instinctsof fish, in the work<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> of his known as the "Halieuticon,"<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>appear to me truly marvellous. The scarus,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> for instance,when enclosed in the wicker kype, makes no effort to escapewith its head, nor does it attempt to thrust its muzzle betweenthe oziers; but turning its tail towards them, it enlarges theorifices with repeated blows therefrom, and so makes its escapebackwards. Should,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> too, another scarus, from without, chanceto see it thus struggling within the kype, it will take the tailof the other in its mouth, and so aid it in its efforts to escape.The lupus,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> again, when surrounded with the net, furrows<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>the sand with its tail, and so conceals itself, until the net haspassed over it. The muræna,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> trusting in the slippery smoothness<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>of its rounded back, boldly faces the meshes of the net,and by repeatedly wriggling its body, makes its escape. Thepolyp<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> makes for the hooks, and, without swallowing the bait,clasps it with its feelers; nor does it quit its hold until it haseaten off the bait, or perceives itself being drawn out of thewater by the rod.</p><p>The mullet,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> too, is aware<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> that within the bait there is ahook concealed, and is on its guard against the ambush; stillhowever, so great is its voracity, that it beats the hook withits tail, and strikes away from it the bait. The lupus,<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> again,<pb n="6007" />shows less foresight and address, but repentance at its imprudencearms it with mighty strength; for, when caught by thehook, it flounders from side to side, and so widens the wound,till at last the insidious hook falls from its mouth. The muræna<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>not only swallows the hook, but catches at the linewith its teeth, and so gnaws it asunder. The anthias,<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> Ovidsays, the moment it finds itself caught by the hook, turns itsbody with its back downwards, upon which there is a sharpknife-like fin, and so cuts the line asunder.</p><p>According to Licinius Macer, the muræna is of the femalesex only, and is impregnated by serpents, as already<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> mentioned;and hence it is that the fishermen, to entice it from itsretreat, and catch it, make a hissing noise in imitation of thehissing of a serpent. He states, also, that by frequently beatingthe water it is made to grow fat, that a blow with a stoutstick will not kill it, but that a touch with a stalk of fennel-giant<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span>is instantly fatal. That in the case of this animal, thelife is centred in the tail, there can be no doubt, as also thatit dies immediately on that part of the body being struck;while, on the other hand, there is considerable difficulty inkilling it with a blow upon the head. Persons who havecome in contact with the razor-fish<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> smell of iron.<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> Thehardest of all fishes, beyond a doubt, is that known as the"orbis:"<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> it is spherical, destitute<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> of scales, and all head.<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span><pb n="6008" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Of this work, begun by Ovid during his banishment in Pontus, andprobably never completed, only a fragment of one hundred and thirty-twolines has come down to us.
