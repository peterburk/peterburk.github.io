For the land is not merely produced by what isbrought down the rivers, as the islands called Echinades areformed by the river Achelous, and the greater part of Egyptby the Nile, where, according to Homer, it was a day and anight's journey from the main land to the island of Pharos<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>;but, in some cases, by the receding of the sea, as, accordingto the same author, was the case with the Circ¾an isles<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>.The same thing also happened in the harbour of Ambracia,for a space of 10,000 paces, and was also said to have takenplace for 5000 at the Pir¾us of Athens<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, and likewise atEphesus, where formerly the sea washed the walls of thetemple of Diana. Indeed, if we may believe Herodotus<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>, thesea came beyond Memphis, as far as the mountains of Ethiopia, andalso from the plains of Arabia. The sea also surrounded Ilium and thewhole of Teuthrania, and covered theplain through which the M¾ander flows<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This ph¾nomenon is distinctly referred to by Seneca, Nat.
