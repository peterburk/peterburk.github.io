<div2 type="chapter" n="24" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 24. (13.)—TREES THE WOOD OF WHICH IS HIGHLY VALUED.FOUR VARIETIES OF THE ASH.</head><p>It is for the sake of their timber that Nature has created theother trees, and more particularly the ash,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> which yields it ingreater abundance. This is a tall, tapering tree, with afeather-like leaf: it has been greatly ennobled by the encomiums of Homer, and the fact that it formed the spear ofAchilles:<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> the wood of it is employed for numerous purposes.The ash which grows upon Mount Ida, in Troas, is so extremely like the cedar,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> that, when the bark is removed, itwill deceive a purchaser.</p><p>The Greeks have distinguished two varieties of this tree,the one long and without knots, the other short, with a harderwood, of a darker colour, and a leaf like that of the laurel.In Macedonia they give the name of "bumelia"<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> to an ashof remarkably large size, with a wood of extreme flexibility.Some authors have divided this tree into several varieties, ac-cording to the localities which it inhabits, and say that theash of the plains has a spotted wood, while that of the mountain ash is more compact. Some Greek writers have statedhat the leaf of the ash is poisonous<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> to beasts of burden, butharmless to all the animals that ruminate<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> The leaves ofhis tree in Italy, however, are not injurious to beasts of burden even; so far from it, in fact, that nothing has been foundto act as so good a specific for the bites of serpents<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> as to drinkthe juice extracted from the leaves, and to apply them to thewounds. So great, too, are the virtues of this tree, that noserpent will ever lie in the shadow thrown by it, either in the<pb n="3366" />morning or the evening, be it ever so long; indeed, they willalways keep at the greatest possible distance from it. Westate the fact from ocular demonstration,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> that if a serpentand a lighted fire are placed within a circle formed of the leavesof the ash, the reptile will rather throw itself into the fire thanencounter the leaves of the tree. By a wonderful provisionof Nature, the ash has been made to blossom before the serpents leave their holes, and the fall of its leaf does not takeplace till after they have retired for the winter.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He does not speak in this place of the "ornus" or "mountain ash;"nor, as Fée observes, does he mention the use of the bark of the ash as afebrifuge, or of its leaves as a purgative. This ash is the Fraxinus excelsior of Decandolles.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Il. xxiv. 277.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny makes a mistake here, in copying from Theophrastus, who saysthat it is the yew that bears so strong a resemblance to the cedar.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "bull's-ash." This variety does not seem to have been identified.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This statement results from his misinterpretation of the language ofTheophrastus, who is really speaking of the yew, which Pliny mistakesor the ash.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Miller asserts that, if given to cows, this leaf will impart a bad flavourto the milk; a statement which, Fée says, is quite incorrect.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A merely fanciful notion, without apparently the slightest foundation:the same, too, may be said of the alleged antipathy of the serpent to thebeech-tree, which is neither venomous nor odoriferous.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This story of Pliny has been corroborated by M. de Verone, and asstrongly contradicted by Camerarius and Charras: with M. Fée, then, wemust leave it to the reader to judge which is the most likely to be speakingthe truth. It is not improbable that Pliny may have been imposed upon,as his credulity would not at all times preclude him from being duped.</p></body>
