Most naturalists are<pb n="2397" />and the dorade.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> Among the river-fish, the silurus<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> is affected by the rising of the Dog-star, and at other times it isalways sent to sleep by thunder. The same is also believedto be the case with the sea-fish called cyprinus.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> In additionto this, the whole sea is sensible<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> of the rising of this star, athing which is more especially to be observed in the Bosporus:for there sea-weeds and fish are seen floating on the surface, allof which have been thrown up from the bottom.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 20. As Hardouin remarks, Aristotle appears to assign the sixty days to the glaucus only.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Naturalists have generally supposed, following Rondelet, Cuvier says,that the ancient glaucus was one of the class of centronotal fishes, theScomber amia, or the Scomber glaucus of Linnæus; but that the incorrectness of this notion is easily proved. Aristotle says, that in the glaucusthe appendices to the pylorus are few in number, as in the dorado (theSparus aurata of Linnæus), while on the other hand the centronoti havethem in almost greater number than any other kind of fish. Athenæussays, B. iii., that the glaucus was a large fish, and Oppian, Hal. iii. 1. 193,speaks of it as taken with mullet. Aristotle, B. ii. c. 13, says, that itdwelt in deep water; but, according to Oppian, Hal. i. 170, it sought itsfood among rocks and in the sand; in addition to which characteristics,we find that it was a fish highly esteemed as a delicacy, the head beingthe part more especially preferred. From all these circumstances, Cuvierconcludes that it was more probably a maigre, the Sciæna aquila of Cuvier,than one of the centronotal fishes.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Literally, the "little ass." Cuvier says, that nearly all the naturalists, following Rondelet, apply this name to the merlus, the Gadus merluccius of Linnæus, or else the genus of the gadus, or cod, in general. It is true, he says, that the "onos," or "ass" of the Greeks, the "asellus"of the Romans, was also known as the <foreign lang="greek">gado\s,</foreign> by the Greeks; but still thisonos had very different characteristics from those of the Gadus merluccius;and among all the gadi of Linnæus, he finds the only one that presentsany of them to be the Gadus tricirrhatus, or sea-weasel, which he therefore thinks to represent the ancient "asellus."</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aurata, "golden-fish." Cuvier observes, that by the Greeks this wascalled <foreign lang="greek">xru/sofrus,</foreign> "eye-brow of gold." It is the French daurade of theMediterranean, the "Sparus aurata" of Linnæus, and is remarkablefor a golden line in form of a crescent over the eyes. Ajasson remarks,that it was also called <foreign lang="greek">)Iw/niskos,</foreign> and suggests that it may have been originally called so from being first found in the Ionian Sea. From anepigram of Martial, B. xiii. Ep. 110, it would appear that this fish wasconsidered a very great dainty, and that it was fattened with Lucrineoysters.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This fish has been already mentioned in c. 17 of the present Book.Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 20, says this of the glanis.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Further mention is made of this fish in c. 74 of the present Book.Aristotle mentions it in B. viii. c. 25, but says nothing about it being asea-fish; while Dorion, as quoted by Athenæus, B. vii., expressly mentionsit among the lake and river fish. Hence Daldechamps seems inclined tocensure our author for this addition; but we find Oppian, Halieut. B. i. 11.101 and 592, speaking of the sea cyprinus; and Athenæus speaks of thecyprinus of Aristotle as being a sea-fish.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 20. This subject is also treated ofby Pliny in B. ii. c. 40, and is again mentioned in B. xviii. c. 58.</p></body>
