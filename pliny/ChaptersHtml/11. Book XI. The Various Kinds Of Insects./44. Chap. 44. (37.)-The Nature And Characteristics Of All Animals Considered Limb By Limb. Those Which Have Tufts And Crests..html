<div2 type="chapter" n="44" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 44. (37.)—THE NATURE AND CHARACTERISTICS OF ALLANIMALS CONSIDERED LIMB BY LIMB. THOSE WHICH HAVETUFTS AND CRESTS.</head><p>In addition to what is already stated, we will add an account of every part of the body of an animal, taken limb by limb.</p><p>All those which have blood, have a head as well. A smallnumber of animals, and those only among the birds, havetufts of various kinds upon the head. The phcenix<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> has along row of feathers on it, from the middle of which arisesanother row; peacocks have a hairy tuft, resembling a bushyshrub; the stymphalis<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> has a sort of pointed crest, and thepheasant, again, small horns. Added to these, there is the lark,a little bird, which, from the appearance of its tuft, wasformerly called "galerita," but has since received theGallic name of " alauda,"<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> a name which it has transferred toone of our legions.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> We have already made mention, also,of one bird<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> to which Nature has given a crest, which it canfold or unfold at pleasure: the birds of the coot kind<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> havealso received from her a crest, which takes its rise at thebeak, and runs along the middle of the head; while the pieof Mars, and the Balearic crane, are furnished with pointedtufts. But the most remarkable feature of all, is the crestwhich we see attached to the heads of our domestic fowls,substantial and indented like a saw; we cannot, in fact,strictly call it flesh, nor can we pronounce it to be cartilageor a callosity, but must admit that it is something of a naturepeculiar to itself. As to the crests of dragons, there is no oneto be found who ever saw one.<pb n="3044" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably the golden pheasant, as already mentioned.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Some kind of heron or crane, Cuvier thinks.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Alauda cristata of Linnæus, so called from " galera," a pointedcap like a helmet.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The fifth legion.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The hoopoe, B. x. c. 44.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Savigny and Cuvier take this to be the Ardea virgo of Linnæus, anative of Numidia.</p></body>
