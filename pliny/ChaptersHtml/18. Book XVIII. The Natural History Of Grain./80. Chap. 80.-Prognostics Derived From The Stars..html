These bodies are sometimes to be seen shootingto and fro;<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> when this happens, winds immediately ensue,in that part of the heavens in which the presage has beenafforded. When the heavens are equally bright throughouttheir whole expanse, at the periods previously mentioned,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> theensuing autumn will be fine and cool. If the spring and summer havepassed not without some rain, the autumn will befine and settled,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and there will be but little wind: when theautumn is fine, it makes a windy winter. When the brightness of the stars is suddenly obscured, though without<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> cloudsor fog, violent tempests may be expected. If numerous starsare seen to shoot,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> leaving a white track behind them, theypresage wind from that quarter.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> If they follow in quicksuccession from the same quarter, the wind will blow steadily,but if from various quarters of the heavens, the wind will shiftin sudden gusts and squalls. If circles are seen to surroundany of the planets, there will be rain.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> In the constellation<pb n="4121" />of Cancer, there are two small stars to be seen, known as theAselli,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> the small space that lies between them being occupiedby a cloudy appearance, which is known as the Manger;<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> whenthis cloud is not visible in a clear sky, it is a presage of aviolent storm. If a fog conceals from our view the one of thesestars which lies to the north-east, there will be high winds fromthe south; but if it is the star which lies to the south that is soobscured, then the wind will be from the north-east. Therainbow, when double, indicates the approach<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> of rain; butif seen after rain, it gives promise, though by no means a certain one, of fine weather. Circular clouds around some of thestars are indicative of rain.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. ii. c. 6 and c. 36.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In c. 59 of this Book</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Densum."
