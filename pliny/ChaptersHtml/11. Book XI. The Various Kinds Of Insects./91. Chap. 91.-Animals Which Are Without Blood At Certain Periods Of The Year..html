<div2 type="chapter" n="91" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 91.â€”ANIMALS WHICH ARE WITHOUT BLOOD AT CERTAINPERIODS OF THE YEAR.</head><p>Those animals which conceal themselves<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> at certain periodsof the year, as already mentioned, have no blood at those times,with the exception, indeed, of some very small drops about the<pb n="3080" />heart. A marvellous dispensation of Nature! and very similarto that witnessed in man, where the blood is sensible of variousmodifications from the slightest causes; for not only, similarlyto the bile, does it rush upwards to the face, but it serves alsoto indicate the various tendencies of the mind, by depictingshame, anger, and fear, in many ways, either by the palenessof the features or their unusual redness; as, in fact, the redness of anger and the blush of modesty are quite differentthings. It is a well-known fact, that when a man is in fear,the blood takes to flight and disappears, and that many persons have been pierced through the body without losing onedrop of blood; a thing, however, which is only the case withman. But as to those animals which we have already mentioned as changing<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> colour, they derive that colour from thereflection<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> of other objects; while, on the other hand, man isthe only one that has the elements which cause these changescentred in himself. All diseases, as well as death, tend toabsorb the blood.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Bears, dormice, serpents, &amp;c.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The polypus and the chameleon.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. viii. cc. 51, 52.</p></body>
