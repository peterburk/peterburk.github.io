<div2 type="chapter" n="20" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 20.—FISHES WHICH ARE NEVER FOUND IN THE EUXINE;THOSE WHICH ENTER IT AND RETURN.</head><p>The Euxine, however, is never entered by any animal<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> thatis noxious to fish, with the exception of the sea-calf and thesmall dolphin. On entering, the tunnies range along<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> theshores to the right, and on departing, keep to those on theleft; this is supposed to arise from the fact that they havebetter sight with the right eye, their powers of vision witheither being naturally very limited. In the channel of theThracian Bosporus, by which the Propontis is connected withthe Euxine, at the narrowest part of the Straits which separate<pb n="2388" />Europe from Asia, there is, near Chalcedon, on the Asiaticside, a rock of remarkable Whiteness, the whole of which canbe seen from the bottom of the sea at the surface. Alarmedat the sudden appearance of this rock, the tunnies alwayshasten in great numbers, and with headlong impetuosity, towards the promontory of Byzantium, which stands exactlyopposite to it, and from this circumstance has received thename of the Golden Horn.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> Hence it is, that all the fishingis at Byzantium, to the great loss of Chalcedon,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> although itis only separated from it by a channel a mile in width. Theywait, however, for the blowing of the north wind to leave theEuxine with a favourable tide, and are never taken untilthey have entered the harbour of Byzantium. These fish donot move about in winter;<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> in whatever place they may happen to be surprised by it, there they pass the winter, till thetime of the equinox.</p><p>Manifesting a wonderful degree of delight, they will oftenaccompany a vessel in full sail, and may be seen from thepoop following it for hours, and a distance of several miles.If a fish-spear even is thrown at them ever so many times,they are not in the slightest degree alarmed at it. Somewriters call the tunnies which follow ships in this manner, bythe name of "pompili."<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span></p><p>Many fishes pass the summer in the Propontis, and do notenter the Euxine; such, for instance, as the sole,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> while on<pb n="2389" />the other hand, the turbot<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> enters it. The sepia<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> is not foundin this sea, although the lolig<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> is. Among the rock-fish, thesea-thrush<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> and the sea-blackbird are wanting, as also purples,though oysters abound here. All these, however, pass thewinter in the Ægean Sea; and of those which enter the Euxine,the only ones that do not<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> return are the trichiæ.<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>—It willbe as well to use the Greek names which most of them bear,seeing that to the same species different countries have givendifferent appellations.—These last, however, are the only onesthat enter the river Ister,<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> and passing along its subterraneouspassages, make their way from it to the Adriatic;<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> and this is<pb n="2390" />the reason why they are to be seen descending into the EuxineSea, but never in the act of returning from it. The time fortaking tunnies is, from the rising of the Vergiliæ<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> to the settingof Arcturus:<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> throughout the rest of the winter season, theylie concealed at the bottom of deep creeks, unless they are in-duced to come out by the warmth of the weather or the fullmoon. These fish fatten<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> to such an extraordinary degree asto burst. The longest period of their life<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> is two years.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 16, from whom Pliny has hereborrowed, makes a somewhat dissimilar statement. He says that "nonoxious animal enters the Euxine, except the <hi rend="ital">phocena [or porpoise],</hi> and thedolphin and little dolphin." Hardouin remarks, however, that Pliny isright in his statement that seals are to be found in the Euxine, and thatRondelet, B. xvi. c. 9, for that reason has suggested that the reading oughtto be altered in Aristotle, and not in Pliny.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle, B. viii. c. 6.

B. ix. c. 42, say the same.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Called "chrysoceras," in B. iv. c. 18, that being the Greek name for"golden horn." He means, that in consequence of the lucrative nature ofthis fishery, it thence obtained the name of the "golden" horn. Dalechamps is of opinion that some person has here substituted the Latin"Aurei cornus," for the Greek name Chrysoceras.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hence, according to Strabo, Chalcedon obtained the name of the"City of the Blind," the people having neglected to choose the oppositeshore for the site of their city. Still, however, a kind of pelamis, or youngtunny, from this place, had the name of "Chalcedonia," and is spokenof as a most exquisite dainty by Aulus Gellius, B. vii c. 16.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 16; Ælian, Hist. Anim. B. ix.; andPlutarch, in his Treatise on the Instincts of Animals, state to a similareffect.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier remarks that the "pompilos" of the ancients, which accompaniedships and left them on nearing the land, was the pilot-fish of the moderns,the Gasterosteus ductor of Linnæus. He thinks, however, that the namemay have also been given to other fish as well, of similar habits.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pleuronectes solea of Linnæns.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pleuronectes maximus of Linnæus.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The cuttle-fish.

The Sepia loligo of Linnæus.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier suggests that the turdus, or sea-thrush, and the merula, or sea-blackbird, were both fishes of the labrus tribe, usually known as "breams."Hippolytus Salvianus, in his book on the Water Animals, states, that in hisday—both these fish were extremely well known, and that they stillretained the names of tordo and merlo. Rondelet, B. vi., says, that thefish anciently called turdus, was in his time known by the name of"vielle," among the French. The dictionaries give "merling, orwhiting," as the synonyme of "merula."</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 16, says, that on going into theEuxine, the trichiæ are either taken or else devoured by the other fishes,for that they are never seen to return.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The trichias, according to Cuvier, is a fish belonging to the family ofherrings. A scholiast on Aristophanes attributes the origin of the nameto the fine fish bones like hairs (<foreign lang="greek">qri\c</foreign>), with which the flesh is filled, whichis a characteristic peculiar to the herring kind. Aristotle, Hist. Anim.B. vi. c. 15, represents the membras, the trichis, and the trichias, as different ages of the same fish. The trichis was little, and very common. InAristophanes, Knights, 1. 662, we find an obol mentioned as the price of ahundred. From the Acharnæ of the same author, we learn that it wassalted as provision for the fleets. Cuvier thinks that everything combinesto point out the sardine, the Clupea sprattus of Linnæus, as the trichis orelse a similar kind of fish, the melette of the African coast, the Clupeameletta of the naturalists. In this latter case the trichias, he thinks, mayhave been the sardine, or, perhaps, the Clupea ficta of Lacépede, which iscalled the "sardine" in some places, and at Lake Garda, in Lombardy,more especially.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Danube. Cuvier says, that this passage probably bears referenceto the clupea ficta or finte, which, as well as the shad, is in the habit ofpassing up streams. As for the story of the fish finding their way to theAdriatic, it is utterly without foundation. Cuvier adds, that the maindifference between the finte and the clupea alosa, or shad, is, that theformer has very fine teeth, the latter none at all.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny has already remarked, B. iii. c. 18, in reference to the supposed descent of the Argonauts from the Ister into the Adriatic, that such apassage by water was totally impossible; hence, as Hardouin says, he isobliged here to have recourse to subterraneous passages.</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Pleiades. See B. ii. c. 47. The rising of the Pleiades was considered the beginning of summer, being the forty-eighth day after thevernal equinox. See also B. xviii. c. 59.</p><p><span id="note_17"><a href="#ref_17">17. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The evening setting, namely. This took place on the fourth day beforethe nones of November. See B. xviii. c. 74.</p><p><span id="note_18"><a href="#ref_18">18. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle, Hist. Anim, B. vi. c. 16.</p><p><span id="note_19"><a href="#ref_19">19. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. vi. c. 16. Hardouin remarks, that thetunny which Pliny mentions in c. 17, as weighing so many hundreds ofpounds, must certainly have been older than this.</p></body>
