AT WHAT PERIOD ARCHED ROOFS WERE FIRSTDECORATED WITH GLASS.</head><p>Mosaic<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> pavements were first introduced in the time ofSylla; at all events, there is still in existence a pavement,formed of small segments, which he ordered to be laid downin the Temple of Fortune, at Præneste. Since his time, thesemosaics have left the ground for the arched roofs of houses,and they are now made of glass. This, however, is but arecent invention; for there can be no doubt that, when Agrippaordered the earthenware walls of the hot baths, in theThermæ which he was building at Rome, to be painted inencaustic, and had the other parts coated with pargetting, he<pb n="6379" />would have had the arches decorated with mosaics in glass, ifthe use of them had been known; or, at all events, if from thewalls of the Theatre of Scaurus, where it figured, as already<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>stated, glass had by that time come to be used for the archedroofs of apartments. It will be as well, therefore, to givesome account, also, of glass.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Lithostrota."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In Chapter 24 of this Book.</p></body>
