<div2 type="chapter" n="95" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 95.—HISTORICAL FACTS CONNECTED WITH THE MISTLETOE.</head><p>Upon this occasion we must not omit to mention the admiration that is lavished upon this plant by the Gauls. TheDruids—for that is the name they give to their magicians<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>—held nothing more sacred than the mistletoe and the treethat bears it, supposing always that tree to be the robur.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>Of itself the robur is selected by them to form whole groves,and they perform none of their religious rites without em-ploying branches of it; so much so, that it is very probablethat the priests themselves may have received their name<pb n="3436" />from the Greek name<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> for that tree. In fact, it is the notionwith them that everything that grows on it has been sentimmediately from heaven, and that the mistletoe upon it is aproof that the tree has been selected by God himself as anobject of his especial favour.</p><p>The mistletoe, however, is but rarely found upon the robur;and when found, is gathered with rites replete with religiousawe. This is done more particularly on the fifth day of themoon, the day which is the beginning of their months andyears, as also of their ages, which, with them, are but thirtyyears. This day they select because the moon, though notyet in the middle of her course, has already considerablepower and influence; and they call her by a name which signifies, in their language, the all-healing.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> Having made alldue preparation for the sacrifice and a banquet beneath thetrees, they bring thither two white bulls, the horns of whichare bound then for the first time. Clad in a white robe thepriest ascends the tree, and cuts the mistletoe with a goldensickle, which is received by others in a white cloak.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> Theythen immolate the victims, offering up their prayers that Godwill render this gift of his propitious to those to whom he hasso granted it. It is the belief with them that the mistletoe,taken in drink, will impart fecundity to all animals that arebarren, and that it is an antidote for all poisons.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> Such arethe religious feelings which we find entertained towards triflingobjects among nearly all nations.</p><p>SUMMARY.—Remarkable facts, narratives, and observations,one thousand one hundred and thirty-five.</p><p>ROMAN AUTHORS QUOTED.—-M.
