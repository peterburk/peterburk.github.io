The head,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> protruding from among the leaves,is very remarkable; and the leaves, which are extremely large,even when compared with those of trees, are very similar tothose of the plant found in our rivers, and known by thename of "personata."<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> So much do the people of thatcountry take advantage of the bounteousness displayed bytheir river, that they are in the habit of plaiting<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> the leavesof the colocasia with such skill as to make vessels of variousshapes, which they are extremely fond of using for drinkingvessels. At the present day, however, this plant is cultivatedin Italy.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Arum colocasia of Linnæus.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The "bean."
