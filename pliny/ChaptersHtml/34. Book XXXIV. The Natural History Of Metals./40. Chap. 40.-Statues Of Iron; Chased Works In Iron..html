Theartist Aristonidas, wishing to express the fury of Athamassubsiding into repentance, after he had thrown his son Learchusfrom the rock,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> blended copper and iron, in order that theblush of shame might be more exactly expressed, by the rust ofthe iron making its appearance through the shining substance ofthe copper; a statue which still exists at Rhodes. There is also,in the same city, a Hercules of iron, executed by Alcon,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> theendurance displayed in his labours by the god having suggestedthe idea. We see too, at Rome, cups of iron consecrated inthe Temple of Mars the Avenger,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> Nature, in conformitywith her usual benevolence, has limited the power of iron, byinflicting upon it the punishment of rust; and has thus displayedher usual foresight in rendering nothing in existencemore perishable, than the substance which brings the greatestdangers upon perishable mortality.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See Ovid, Metam.
