(40.)—RESPECTING THE FOOD OF BIRDS–THE CAPRI-MULGUS, THE PLATEA.</head><p>The instincts, also, of birds are no less varied, and more especially in relation to their food. "Caprimulgus<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> is thename of a bird, which is to all appearance a large blackbird;it thieves by night, as it cannot see during the day. It entersthe folds of the shepherds, and makes straight for the udderof the she-goat, to suck the milk. Through the injury thusinflicted the udder shrivels away, and the goat that has beenthus deprived of its milk, is afflicted with incipient blindness.<pb n="2522" /></p><p>"Platea"<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> is the name of another, which pounces upon otherbirds when they have dived in the sea, and, seizing the headwith its bill, makes them let go their prey. This bird alsoswallows and fills itself with shell-fish, shells and all; afterthe natural heat of its crop has softened them, it brings themup again, and then picking out the shells from the rest, selectsthe parts that are fit for food.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "goat-sucker."
