(57.)â€”THE DISEASES OF FOWLS, AND THEIR REMEDIES.</head><p>The most dangerous malady with every kind of fowl is thatknown as the "pituita;"<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> which is prevalent more particularly between the times of harvest and vintage. Themode of treatment is to put them on a spare diet, and to expose them, while asleep, to the action of smoke, and more especially that of bay leaves or of the herb called savin. Afeather also is inserted, and passed across through the nostrils,care being taken to move it every day; while their food consists of leeks mixed with speltmeal, or else is first soaked inwater in which an owlet has been dipped, or boiled togetherwith the seeds of the white vine. There are also some otherreceipts besides.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The pip.</p></body>
