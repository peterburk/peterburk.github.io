It has a white spot on thehead, strongly resembling a sort of a diadem.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> When ithisses, all the other serpents fly from it: and it does not advance its body, like the others, by a succession of folds, butmoves along upright and erect upon the middle. It destroysall shrubs, not only by its contact, but those even that it hasbreathed upon; it burns up all the grass too, and breaks thestones, so tremendous is its noxious influence. It was formerlya general belief that if a man on horseback killed one of theseanimals with a spear, the poison would run up the weapon andkill, not only the rider, but the horse as well. To this dreadful monster the effluvium of the weasel is fatal, a thing thathas been tried with success, for kings have often desired to seeits body when killed; so true is it that it has pleased Naturethat there should be nothing without its antidote. The animalis thrown into the hole of the basilisk, which is easily knownfrom the soil around it being infected. The weasel destroysthe basilisk by its odour, but dies itself in this struggle of natureagainst its own self.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This account of the basilisk's eye, like that of the catoblepas, is entirely devoid of foundation.—B.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Many species have certain marks on the head, which were supposed toresemble a crown.—B.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There is probably no foundation for this account of the action of theeffluvium of the weasel upon the basilisk or any other species of serpent.—B.</p></body>
