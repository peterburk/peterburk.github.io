(14.)ÑTHE TEMPLE OF DIANA AT EPHESUS.</head><p>The most wonderful monument of Gr¾cian magnificence,and one that merits our genuine admiration, is the Temple ofDiana at Ephesus, which took one hundred and twenty yearsin building, a work in which all Asia<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> joined. A marshy soilwas selected for its site, in order that it might not suffer fromearthquakes, or the chasms which they produce. On theother hand, again, that the foundations of so vast a pile mightnot have to rest upon a loose and shifting bed, layers of troddencharcoal were placed beneath, with fleeces<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> covered with woolupon the top of them. The entire length of the temple isfour hundred and twenty-five feet, and the breadth two hundredand twenty-five. The columns are one hundred andtwenty-seven in number, and sixty feet in height, each ofthem presented by a different king. Thirty-six of thesecolumns are carved, and one of them by the hand of Scopas.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>Chersiphron<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> was the architect who presided over the work.<pb n="6344" /></p><p>The great marvel in this building is, how such ponderousArchitraves<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> could possibly have been raised to so great aheight. This, however, the architect effected by means ofbags filled with sand, which he piled up upon an inclinedplane until they reached beyond the capitals of the columns;then, as he gradually emptied the lower bags, the architraves<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>insensibly settled in the places assigned them. But thegreatest difficulty of all was found, in laying the lintel whichhe placed over the entrance-doors. It was an enormous massof stone, and by no possibility could it be brought to lie levelupon the jambs which formed its bed; in consequence ofwhich, the architect was driven to such a state of anxiety anddesperation as to contemplate suicide. Wearied and quiteworn out by such thoughts as these, during the night, theysay, he beheld in a dream the goddess in honour of whom thetemple was being erected; who exhorted him to live on, forthat she herself had placed the stone in its proper position.And such, in fact, next morning, was found to be the case,the stone apparently having come to the proper level by dintof its own weight. The other decorations of this work wouldsuffice to fill many volumes, but they do not tend in any wayto illustrate the works of Nature.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Asia Minor.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Hotel de Ville at Brussels is said to have been built upon astratum of hides.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See Chapter 4 of the present Book.
