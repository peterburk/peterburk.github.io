For if thisreptile happens to crawl up a tree, it infects all the fruit withits poison, and kills those who eat thereof by the chilling properties of its venom, which in its effects is in no way differentfrom aconite. Nay, even more than this, if it only toucheswith its foot the wood upon which bread is baked, or if ithappens to fall into a well, the same fatal effects will be sureto ensue. The saliva, too, of this reptile, if it comes in contactwith any part of the body, the sole of the foot even, willcause the hair to fall off from the whole of the body. And yetthe salamander, highly venomous as it is, is eaten by certainanimals, swine for example; owing, no doubt, to that antipathywhich prevails in the natural world.</p><p>From what we find stated, it is most probable, that, nextto the animals which eat it, the best neutralizers of the poisonof this reptile, are, cantharides taken in drink, or a lizard eatenwith the food; other antidotes we have already mentioned, orshall notice in the appropriate place. As to what the magicians<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> say, that it is proof against fire, being, as they tell us,the only animal that has the property of extinguishing fire, if ithad been true, it would have been made trial of at Rome longbefore this. Sextius says that the salamander, preserved inhoney and taken with the food, after removing the intestines,head, and feet, acts as an aphrodisiac: he denies also that ithas the property of extinguishing fire.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. x. c. 86.
