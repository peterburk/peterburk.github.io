Some authors state that there is a bird inSardinia, resembling the crane and called the "gromphena;"<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>but it is no longer known even by the people of that country,in my opinion. In the same province, too, there is the ophion,an animal which resembles the deer in the hair only, and to befound<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> nowhere else. The same authors have spoken also ofthe "subjugus,"<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> but have omitted to state what animal it is,or where it is to be found. That it did formerly exist, however,I have no doubt, as certain remedies are described as beingderived from it. M. Cicero speaks of animals called "biuri,"<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>which gnaw the vines in Campania.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Possibly a kind of crane.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. viii. c. 75, and B. xxviii. c. 42.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It has not been identified.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hardouin thinks that the worm called <foreign lang="greek">i)/c</foreign> by the Greeks is meant.Ovid speaks in his Fasti, B. i. 11. 354—360, of the goat, as being very fondof gnawing the vine.</p></body>
