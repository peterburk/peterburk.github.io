Those plants, however,which are in bud must not be spaded at the roots, except wherethe soil is particularly rich. The seed-plots, too, must be wellcleared with the hoe, the barley-harvest got in, and thethreshing-floor prepared for the harvest with chalk, as Cato<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>tells us, slackened with amurca of olives; Virgil<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> makes mentionof a method still more laborious even. In general, however, it isconsidered sufficient to make it perfectly level, andthen to cover it with a solution of cow-dung<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and water; thisbeing thought sufficient to prevent the dust from rising.<pb n="4103" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">De Re Rust. 129.
