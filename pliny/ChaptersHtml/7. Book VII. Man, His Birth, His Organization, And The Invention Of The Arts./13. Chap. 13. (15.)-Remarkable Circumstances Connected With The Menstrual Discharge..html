<div2 type="chapter" n="13" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 13. (15.)—REMARKABLE CIRCUMSTANCES CONNECTED WITH THE MENSTRUAL DISCHARGE.</head><p>Among the whole range of animated beings, the human fe-<pb n="2151" />male is the only one that has the monthly discharge,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and inwhose womb are found what we term "moles." These molesconsist of a shapeless mass of flesh, devoid of all life, and capable of resisting either the edge or the point of the knife;they are movable in the body, and obstruct the menstrualdischarge; sometimes, too, they are productive of fatal consequences to the woman, in the same manner as a real fœtus;while, at other times, they remain in the body until old age;in some cases, again, they are discharged, in consequence of anincreased action of the bowels.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> Something of a very similarnature is produced in the body of the male, which is called a"schirrus;"<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> this was the case with Oppius Capito, a man ofprætorian rank.</p><p>It would indeed be a difficult matter to find anything whichis productive of more marvellous effects than the menstrualdischarge.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> On the approach of a woman in this state,must will become sour, seeds which are touched by herbecome sterile, grafts wither away, garden plants are parchedup, and the fruit will fall from the tree beneath which shesits. Her very look, even, will dim the brightness of mirrors,blunt the edge of steel, and take away the polish from ivory.A swarm of bees, if looked upon by her, will die immediately;<pb n="2152" />brass and iron will instantly become rusty, and emit an offensiveodour; while dogs which may have tasted of the matter so discharged are seized with madness, and their bite is venomousand incurable.</p><p>In addition to this, the bitumen which is found at certainperiods of the year, floating on the lake of Judæa, known asAsphaltites, a substance which is peculiarly tenacious, andadheres to everything that it touches, can only be divided intoseparate pieces by means of a thread which has been dippedin this virulent matter.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> It is said that the ant, even aninsect so extremely minute, is sensible of its presence, andrejects the grains which it has been carrying, and will not return to them again.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span></p><p>This discharge, which is productive of such great and singular effects, occurs in women every thirty days, and in agreater degree every three months.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> In some individualsit occurs oftener than once a month, and in others, again,it never takes place. Women of this nature, however, are notcapable of bearing children, because it is of this substance thatthe infant is formed.<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> The seed of the male, acting as a sortof leaven, causes it to unite and assume a form, and in duetime it acquires life, and assumes a bodily shape. The consequence is, that if the flow continues during pregnancy, thechild will be weak, or else will not live; or if it does, it willbe full of gross humours, Nigidius says.</p><p>(16.) The same author is also of opinion, that the milk of awoman who is giving suck will not become impure, if she shouldhappen to become pregnant again by the same man.<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span><pb n="2153" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Some of the "simiæ " are subject to a periodical discharge, analogousto that of the human female; but, according to Cuvier, it is in smallerquantity, and not at stated periods. The females of various other animals,when in a state to receive the male, have a discharge from the same parts,but totally different in its properties, and the mode in which it makes itsappearance. Virgil, Geor. B. iii. 1. 280, <hi rend="ital">et seq.,</hi> refers to this subject.—B.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny makes some further remarks on these substances in a subsequentplace, see B. x. c. 84; where he says they are produced without the intercourse of the male; this point has been much discussed, and is perhapsscarcely yet decided.—B.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There is no actual resemblance between moles and schirri; they areproduced by different causes, and exist in different parts of the body. Molesare always formed in the womb, and probably have some connection withthe generative functions; while schirri are morbid indurations, which maketheir appearance in various parts of the body. Hippocrates gives someaccount of moles, in his work on the Diseases of Women. They are alsonoticed by Aristotle.—B.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">All the poisonous and noxious effects which were attributed by theancients to the menstrual discharge, are without the slightest foundation.The opinions entertained on this point by the Jews, may be collected fromLeviticus, c. xv. ver. 19, <hi rend="ital">et seq.</hi> Pliny enlarges upon this subject in a subsequent place. See B. xxviii. c. 23.—B.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Both Josephus, Bell. Jud. B. iv. c. 9, and Tacitus, Hist. B. v. c. 6,give an account of this supposed action of this fluid on the bitumen ofLake Asphaltites; the statement is no doubt entirely unfounded, but it is acurious instance of popular credulity.—B.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There are still somewhat similar superstitions in existence, even inthis country among others; it is not uncommonly believed that meat willnot take salt from the hands of a female during the discharge of thecatamenia.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This statement is without foundation.—B.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The fact is true, that females in whom the menstrual discharge doesnot take place, are seldom, if ever, capable of conception; but it does notdepend on the cause here assigned. See the remarks of Cuvier, Lemaire,vol. iii. p. 82, and Ajasson, vol. vi. p. 173.—B.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny clearly alludes to an opinion expressed by Galen, in which he says, "that if women while giving suck, have sexual intercourse, the milkbecomes tainted." Hardouin remarks, that Pliny shows considerable cautionhere in bringing forward Nigidius as the propounder of these opinions, thetruth of which he himself seems to have doubted.</p></body>
