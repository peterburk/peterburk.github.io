<div2 type="chapter" n="28" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 28.—GERMANY.</head><p>The whole of the shores of this sea as far as the Scaldis<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>,a river of Germany, is inhabited by nations, the dimensionsof whose respective territories it is quite impossible to state,so immensely do the authors differ who have touched uponthis subject. The Greek writers and some of our owncountrymen have stated the coast of Germany to be 2500miles in extent, while Agrippa, comprising Rhætia and Noricum inhis estimate, makes the length to be 686<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> miles, andthe breadth 148<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>. (14.) The breadth of Rhætia alone howeververy nearly exceeds that number of miles, and indeedwe ought to state that it was only subjugated at about theperiod of the death of that general; while as for Germany,the whole of it was not thoroughly known to us for manyyears after his time. If I may be allowed to form a conjecture, themargin of the coast will be found to be not far shortof the estimate of the Greek writers, while the distance in astraight line will nearly correspond with that mentioned byAgrippa.</p><p>There are five German races; the Vandili<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, parts of whom<pb n="1346" />are the Burgundiones<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>, the Varini<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>, the Carini<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>, and theGutones<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>: the Ingævones, forming a second race, a portion ofwhom are the Cimbri<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>, the Teutoni<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>, and the tribes<pb n="1347" />of the Chauci<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>. The Istævones<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>, who join up to the Rhine,and to whom the Cimbri<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> belong, are the third race; whilethe Hermiones, forming a fourth, dwell in the interior,and include the Suevi<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>, the Hermunduri<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>, the Chatti<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span>, and<pb n="1348" />the Cherusci<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span>: the fifth race is that of the Peucini<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span>, who arealso the Basternæ, adjoining the Daci previously mentioned.The more famous rivers that flow into the ocean are theGuttalus<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span>, the Vistillus or Vistula, the Albis<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span>, theVisurgis<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span>,the Amisius<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span>, the Rhine, and the Mosa<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span>. In the interior isthe long extent of the Hercynian<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span> range, which in grandeuris inferior to none.<pb n="1349" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now the Scheldt.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In a straight line, of course. Parisot is of opinion that in formingthis estimate Agrippa began at the angle formed by the river Piave inlat. 46°4?, measuring thence to Cape Rubeas (now Rutt) in lat. 54°25?.This would give 8°21?, to which, if we add some twenty leagues for obliquity or difference of longitude, the total would make exactly the distancehere mentioned.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">As Parisot remarks, it is totally impossible to conceive the sourceof such an erroneous conclusion as this. Some readings make the amount248, others 268.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">As already mentioned, Zeuss has satisfactorily shown that the Vandili or Vindili properly belonged to the Hermiones. Tacitus mentionsbut three groups of the German nations; the Ingævones on the ocean,the Hermiones in the interior, and the Istævones in the east and southof Germany. The Vandili, a Gothic race, dwelt originally on the northerncoast of Germany, but afterwards settled north of the Marcomanni on theRiesengebirge. They subsequently appeared in Dacia and Pannonia, andin the beginning of the fifth century invaded Spain. Under Genseric theypassed over into Africa, and finally took and plundered Rome in A.D. <date value="455" authname="455">455</date>.Their kingdom was finally destroyed by Belisarius.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is supposed that the Burgundiones were a Gothic people dwellingin the country between the rivers Viadus and Vistula, though AmmianusMarcellinus declares them to have been of pure Roman origin. Howthey came into the country of the Upper Maine in the south-west ofGermany in A.D. <date value="289" authname="289">289</date>, historians have found themselves at aloss to inform us. It is not improbable that the two peoples were notidentical,and that the similarity of their name arose only from the circumstance thatthey both resided in "burgi" or burghs. See Gibbon, iii. 99.<hi rend="ital">Bohn's Ed.</hi></p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Varini dwelt on the right bank of the Albis or Elbe, north of theLangobardi. Ptolemy however, who seems to mention them as the Avarini, speaks of them as dwelling near the sources of the Vistula, on thesite of the present Cracow. See Gibbon, iv. 225. <hi rend="ital">Bohn's Ed.</hi></p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Nothing whatever is known of the locality of this people.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">They are also called in history Gothi, Gothones, Gotones and Gutæ.According to Pytheas of Marseilles (as mentioned by Pliny, B. xxxvii.c. 2), they dwelt on the coasts of the Baltic, in the vicinity of what isnow called the Fritsch-Haff. Tacitus also refers to the same district,though he does not speak of them as inhabiting the coast. Ptolemyagain speaks of them as dwelling on the east of the Vistula, and to thesouth of the Venedi. The later form of their name, <hi rend="ital">Gothi,</hi> doesnot occurtill the time of Caracalla. Their native name was Gutthinda. They arefirst spoken of as a powerful nation at the beginning of the thirdcentury, when we find them mentioned as 'Getæ,' from thecircumstance oftheir having occupied the countries formerly inhabited by the SarmatianGetæ. The formidable attacks made by this people, divided into thenations of the Ostrogoths and Visigoths, upon the Roman power duringits decline, are too well known to every reader of Gibbon to requirefurther notice.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The inhabitants of Chersonesus Cimbrica, the modern peninsula ofJutland. It seems doubtful whether these Cimbri were a Germanicnation or a Celtic tribe, as also whether they were the same racewhosenumerous hordes successively defeated six Roman armies, and were finallyconquered by C. Marius, B.C. <date value="-101" authname="-101">101</date>, in the Campi Raudii. The moregeneral impression, however, entertained by historians, is that they werea Celtic or Gallic and not a Germanic nation. The name is said to havesignified "robbers." See Gibbon, i. 273, iii. 365. <hi rend="ital">Bohn's Ed.</hi></p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Teutoni or Teutones dwelt on the coasts of the Baltic, adjacentto the territory of the Cimbri. Their name, though belonging originallyto a single nation or tribe, came to be afterwards applied collectively tothe whole people of Germany. See Gibbon, iii. 139. <hi rend="ital">Bohn's Ed.</hi></p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Also called Cauchi, Cauci, and Cayci, a German tribe to the east ofthe Frisians, between the rivers Ems and Elbe. The modern Oldenburg and Hanover are supposed to pretty nearly represent the countryof the Chauci. In B. xvi. c. 1. 2, will be found a further account of themby Pliny, who had visited their country, at least that part of it which layon the sea-coast. They are mentioned for the last time in the third century, when they had extended so far south and west that they are spokenof as living on the banks of the Rhine.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Mentioned by Tacitus as dwelling in the east and south of Germany.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It has been suggested by Titzius that the words "quorum Cimbri,""to whom the Cimbri belong," are an interpolation; which is not improbable, or at least that the word "Cimbri" has been substituted forsome other name.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This appears to be properly the collective name of a great number ofthe German tribes, who were of a migratory mode of life, and spoken ofin opposition to the more settled tribes, who went under the general nameof Ingævones. Cæsar speaks of them as dwelling east of the Ubii andSygambri, and west of the Cherusci. Strabo makes them extend in aneasterly direction beyond the Albis or Elbe, and southerly as far as thesources of the Danube. Tacitus gives the name of Suevia to the wholeof the east of Germany, from the Danube to the Baltic. The name ofthe modern Suabia is derived from a body of adventurers from variousGerman tribes, who assumed the name of Suevi in consequence of theirnot possessing any other appellation.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A large and powerful tribe of Germany, which occupied theextensive tract of country between the mountains in the north-west ofBohemia and the Roman Wall in the south-west, which formed theboundaryof the Agri Decumates. On the east they bordered on the Narisci, onthe north-east on the Cherusci, and on the north-west on the Chatti.There is little doubt that they originally formed part of the Suevi. Ata later period they spread in a north-easterly direction, taking possessionof the north-western part of Bohemia and the country about the sourcesof the Maine and Saale, that is, the part of Franconia as far as Kissingenand the south-western part of the kingdom of Saxony. The nameHermunduri is thought by some to signify highlanders, and to be acompound of <hi rend="ital">Her</hi> or <hi rend="ital">Ar,</hi> "high," and <hi rend="ital">Mund,</hi> "man."</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">One of the great tribes of Germany, which rose to importance afterthe decay of the power of the Cherusci. It is thought by ethnographersthat their name is still preserved in the word "Hessen." They formed thechief tribe of the Hermiones here mentioned, and are described by Cæsaras belonging to the Suevi, though Tacitus distinguishes them, and noGerman tribe in fact occupied more permanently its original locality thanthe Chatti. Their original abode seems to have extended from the Wester-wald in the west to the Saale in Franconia, and from the river Mainein the south as far as the sources of the Elison and the Weser, so thatthey occupied exactly the modern country of Hessen, including perhapsa portion of the north-west of Bavaria. See Gibbon, vol. iii. 99.<hi rend="ital">Bohn's Ed.</hi></p><p><span id="note_17"><a href="#ref_17">17. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Cherusci were the most celebrated of all the German tribes, andare mentioned by Cæsar as of the same importance as the Suevi, fromwhom they were separated by the Silva Bacensis. There is some difficulty in stating their exact locality, but it is generally supposed thattheir country extended from the Visurgis or Weser in the west to theAlbis or Elbe in the east, and from Melibocus in the north to the neighbourhood of the Sudeti in the south, so that the Chamavi and Langobardi were their northern neighbours, the Chatti the western, the Hermunduri the southern, and the Silingi and Semnones their easternneighbours. This tribe, under their chief Arminius or Hermann, forming a confederation with many smaller tribes in A.D. <date value="9" authname="9">9</date>, completely defeatedthe Romans in the famous battle of the Teutoburg Forest. In later timesthey were conquered by the Chatti, so that Ptolemy speaks of themonly as a small tribe on the south of the Hartz mountain. Their nameafterwards appears, in the beginning of the fourth century, in the confederation of the Franks.</p><p><span id="note_18"><a href="#ref_18">18. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Peucini are mentioned here, as also by Tacitus, as identical withthe Basternæ. As already mentioned, supposing them to be names fordistinct nations, they must be taken an only names of individual tribes,and not of groups of tribes. It is generally supposed that their firstsettlements in Sarmatia were in the highlands between the Theiss andthe March, whence they passed onward to the lower Danube, as far asits mouth, where a portion of them, settling in the island of Peuce, obtained the name of Peucini. In the later geographers we find themsettled between the Tyrus or Dniester, and the Borysthenes or Dnieper,the Peucini remaining at the mouth of the Danube.</p><p><span id="note_19"><a href="#ref_19">19. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">According to Parisot, the Guttalus is the same as the Alle, a tributary of the Pregel. Cluver thinks that it is the same as the Oder.Other writers again consider it the same as the Pregel.</p><p><span id="note_20"><a href="#ref_20">20. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or Elbe.</p><p><span id="note_21"><a href="#ref_21">21. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now the Weser.</p><p><span id="note_22"><a href="#ref_22">22. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The modern Ems.</p><p><span id="note_23"><a href="#ref_23">23. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Meuse.</p><p><span id="note_24"><a href="#ref_24">24. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The 'Hercynia Silva,' Hercynian Forest or Range, is very differentlydescribed by the writers of various ages. The earliest mention of it isby Aristotle. Judging from the accounts given by Cæsar, PomponiusMela, and Strabo, the 'Hercynia Silva' appears to have been a generalname for almost all the mountains of Southern and Central Germany,that is, from the sources of the Danube to Transylvania, comprising theSchwarzwald, Odenwald, Spessart, Rhön, Thuringer Wald, the Hartzmountain (which seems in a great measure to have retained the ancientname), Raube Alp, Steigerwald, Fichtelgebirge, Erzgebirge, andRiesengebirge. At a later period when the mountains of Germany hadbecomebetter known, the name was applied to the more limited range extendingaround Bohemia, and through Moravia into Hungary.</p></body>
