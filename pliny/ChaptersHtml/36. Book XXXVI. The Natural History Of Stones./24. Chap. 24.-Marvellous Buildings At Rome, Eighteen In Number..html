<div2 type="chapter" n="24" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 24.—MARVELLOUS BUILDINGS AT ROME, EIGHTEEN IN NUMBER.</head><p>But it is now time to pass on to the marvels in buildingdisplayed by our own City, and to make some enquiry into theresources and experience that we have gained in the lapse ofeight hundred years; and so prove that here, as well, the rest of<pb n="6346" />the world has been outdone by us: a thing which will appear,in fact, to have occurred almost as many times as the marvelsare in number which I shall have to enumerate. If, indeed,all the buildings of our City are considered in the aggregate,and supposing them, so to say, all thrown together in onevast mass, the united grandeur of them would lead one tosuppose that we were describing another world, accumulatedin a single spot.</p><p>Not to mention among our great works, the Circus Maximus,that was constructed by the Dictator Cæsar, one stadiumin width and three in length, and occupying, with the adjacentbuildings, no less than four jugera, with room for twohundred and sixty thousand spectators seated; am I not toinclude in the number of our magnificent constructions, theBasilica of Paulus,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> with its admirable Phrygian columns; theForum of the late Emperor Augustus; the Temple of Peace,erected by the Emperor Vespasianus Augustus—some of thefinest works that the world has ever beheld—the roofing,too, of the Vote-Office,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> that was built by Agrippa? not toforget that, before his time, Valerius of Ostia, the architect,had covered in a theatre at Rome, at the time of the publicGames celebrated by Libo?<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span></p><p>We behold with admiration pyramids that were built bykings, when the very ground alone, that was purchased by theDictator Cæsar, for the construction of his Forum, cost onehundred millions of sesterces! If, too, an enormous expenditurehas its attractions for any one whose mind is influencedby monetary considerations, be it known to him that the housein which Clodius dwelt, who was slain by Milo, was purchasedby him at the price of fourteen million eight hundred thousandsesterces! a thing that, for my part, I look upon as noless astounding than the monstrous follies that have been displayedby kings. And then, as to Milo himself, the sums inwhich he was indebted, amounted to no less than seventy mil-<pb n="6347" />lions of sesterces; a state of things, to be considered, in myopinion, as one of the most portentous phænomena in the historyof the human mind. But it was in those days, too, thatold men still spoke in admiration of the vast proportions ofthe Agger,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and of the enormous foundations of the Capitol;of the public sewers, too, a work more stupendous than any;as mountains had to be pierced for their construction, and,like the hanging city<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> which we recently mentioned, navigationhad to be carried on beneath Rome; an event whichhappened in the ædileship<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> of M. Agrippa, after he had filledthe office of consul.</p><p>For this purpose, there are seven rivers, made, by artificialchannels, to flow beneath the city. Rushing onward, like somany impetuous torrents, they are compelled to carry off andsweep away all the sewerage; and swollen as they are by thevast accession of the pluvial waters, they reverberate againstthe sides and bottom of their channels. Occasionally, too,the Tiber, overflowing, is thrown backward in its course, anddischarges itself by these outlets: obstinate is the contest thatensues within between the meeting tides, but so firm and solidis the masonry, that it is enabled to offer an effectual resistance.Enormous as are the accumulations that are carried alongabove, the work of the channels never gives way. Housesfalling spontaneously to ruins, or levelled with the groundby conflagrations, are continually battering against them;the ground, too, is shaken by earthquakes every now andthen; and yet, built as they were in the days of TarquiniusPriscus, seven hundred years ago, these constructions havesurvived, all but unharmed. We must not omit, too, to mentionone remarkable circumstance, and all the more remarkablefrom the fact, that the most celebrated historians haveomitted to mention it. Tarquinius Priscus having commencedthe sewers, and set the lower classes to work upon them, thelaboriousness and prolonged duration of the employment becameequally an object of dread to them; and the consequencewas, that suicide was a thing of common occurrence, the<pb n="6348" />citizens adopting this method of escaping their troubles. Forthis evil, however, the king devised a singular remedy, andone that has never<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> been resorted to either before that time orsince: for he ordered the bodies of all who had been thusguilty of self-destruction, to be fastened to a cross, and leftthere as a spectacle to their fellow - citizens and a preyto birds and wild beasts. The result was, that that senseof propriety which so peculiarly attaches itself to the Romanname, and which more than once has gained a victorywhen the battle was all but lost, came to the rescue on thisoccasion as well; though for this once, the Romans were inreality its dupes, as they forgot that, though they felt shockedat the thoughts of such ignominy while alive, they would bequite insensible to any such disgrace when dead. It is saidthat Tarquinius made these sewers of dimensions sufficientlylarge to admit of a waggon laden with hay passing along them.</p><p>All that we have just described, however, is but triflingwhen placed in comparison with one marvellous fact, which Imust not omit to mention before I pass on to other subjects.In the consulship<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> of M. Lepidus and Q. Catulus, there wasnot at Rome, as we learn from the most trustworthy authors,a finer house than the one which belonged to Lepidushimself: and yet, by Hercules! within five-and-thirty yearsfrom that period, the very same house did not hold the hundredthrank even in the City! Let a person, if he will, intaking this fact into consideration, only calculate the vastmasses of marble, the productions of painters, the regal treasuresthat must have been expended, in bringing these hundredmansions to vie with one that had been in its day the most sumptuousand the most celebrated in all the City; and then lethim reflect how that, since that period, and down to the presenttime, these houses have all of them been surpassed byothers without number. There can be no doubt that conflagrationsare a punishment inflicted upon us for our luxury;but such are our habits, that in spite of such warnings as these,we cannot be made to understand that there are things in existencemore perishable even than man himself.</p><p>But there are still two other mansions by which all theseedifices have been eclipsed. Twice have we seen the whole<pb n="6349" />City environed by the palaces of the Emperors Caius<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> andNero; that of the last, that nothing might be wanting toits magnificence, being coated with gold.<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> Surely such palacesas these must have been intended for the abode of those whocreated this mighty empire, and who left the plough or theirnative hearth to go forth to conquer nations, and to returnladen with triumphs! men, in fact, whose very fields even occupiedless space than the audience-chambers<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> of these palaces.</p><p>Indeed, one cannot but help reflecting how trifling a portion ofthese palaces was equal to the sites which the republic grantedto its invincible generals, for the erection of their dwellings.The supreme honour, too, attendant upon these grants—as inthe case of P. Valerius Publicola, the first consul with L. Brutus,for his many meritorious services; and of his brother,who twice in one consulship defeated the Sabines—was thepermission granted, by the terms of the decree, to have thedoors of their houses opening from without, and the gatesthrown back upon the public street. Such was the most distinguishedprivilege accorded in those days to triumphal mansionseven!</p><p>I will not permit, however, these two Caiuses,<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> or twoNeros, to enjoy this glory even, such as it is; for I will provethat these extravagant follies of theirs have been surpassed, inthe use that was made of his wealth by M. Scaurus, a privatecitizen. Indeed, I am by no means certain that it was notthe ædileship of this personage that inflicted the first greatblow upon the public manners, and that Sylla was not guiltyof a greater crime in giving such unlimited power to his stepson,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>than in the proscription of so many thousands. Duringhis ædileship, and only for the temporary purposes of a fewdays, Scaurus executed the greatest<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> work that has ever been<pb n="6350" />made by the hands of man, even when intended to be of everlastingduration; his Theatre, I mean. This building consistedof three storeys, supported upon three hundred andsixty columns; and this, too, in a city which had not allowedwithout some censure one of its greatest citizens<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> to erectsix<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> pillars of Hymettian marble. The ground-storey was ofmarble, the second of glass, a species of luxury which eversince that time has been quite unheard of, and the highest ofgilded wood. The lowermost columns, as previously<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> stated,were eight-and-thirty feet in height; and, placed betweenthese columns, as already<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> mentioned, were brazen statues,three thousand in number. The area<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> of this theatre affordedaccommodation for eighty thousand spectators; and yet theTheatre of Pompeius, after the City had so greatly increased,and the inhabitants had become so vastly more numerous, wasconsidered abundantly large, with its sittings for forty thousandonly. The rest of the fittings of it, what with Attalic<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span>vestments, pictures, and the other stage-properties,<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> were ofsuch enormous value that, after Scaurus had had conveyed tohis Tusculan villa such parts thereof as were not required forthe enjoyment of his daily luxuries, the loss was no less thanthree hundred millions of sesterces, when the villa was burntby his servants in a spirit of revenge.</p><p>The consideration of such prodigality as this quite distractsmy attention, and compels me to digress from my original purpose,in order to mention a still greater instance of extravagance,in reference to wood. C. Curio,<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> who died during thecivil wars, fighting on the side of Cæsar, found, to his dismay,that he could not, when celebrating the funeral games inhonour of his father, surpass the riches and magnificence ofScaurus—for where, in fact, was to be found such a stepsireas Sylla, and such a mother as Metella, that bidder at allauctions for the property of the proscribed? Where, too, washe to find for his father, M. Scaurus, so long the principal manin the city, and one who had acted, in his alliance with Marius,<pb n="6351" />as a receptacle for the plunder of whole provinces?—Indeed,Scaurus himself was now no longer able to rival himself; and itwas at least one advantage which he derived from this destructionby fire of so many objects brought from all parts of the earth,that no one could ever after be his equal in this species of folly.Curio, consequently, found himself compelled to fall back uponhis own resources, and to think of some new device of hisown. It is really worth our while to know what this devicewas, if only to congratulate ourselves upon the manners of thepresent day, and to reverse the ordinary mode of expression,and term ourselves the men of the olden time.<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span></p><p>He caused to be erected, close together, two theatres of verylarge dimensions, and built of wood, each of them nicely poised,and turning on a pivot. Before mid-day, a spectacle of gameswas exhibited in each; the theatres being turned back to back,in order that the noise of neither of them might interfere withwhat was going on in the other. Then, in the latter part ofthe day, all on a sudden, the two theatres were swung round,and, the corners uniting, brought face to face; the outerframes,<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span> too, were removed, and thus an amphitheatre wasformed, in which combats of gladiators were presented to theview; men whose safety was almost less compromised than wasthat of the Roman people, in allowing itself to be thus whirledround from side to side. Now, in this case, which have wemost reason to admire, the inventor or the invention? the artist,or the author of the project? him who first dared to think ofsuch an enterprize, or him who ventured to undertake it? himwho obeyed the order, or him who gave it? But the thing thatsurpasses all is, the frenzy that must have possessed the public,to take their seats in a place which must of necessity have beenso unsubstantial and so insecure. Lo and behold! here is apeople that has conquered the whole earth, that has subduedthe universe, that divides the spoils of kingdoms and of nations,that sends its laws to foreign lands, that shares in some degreethe attributes of the immortal gods in common with mankind,suspended aloft in a machine, and showering plaudits even uponits own peril!<pb n="6352" /></p><p>This is indeed holding life cheap; and can we, after this,complain of our disasters at Cannæ? How vast the catastrophethat might have ensued! When cities are swallowed up byan earthquake, it is looked upon by mankind as a general calamity;and yet, here have we the whole Roman people, embarked,so to say, in two ships, and sitting suspended on acouple of pivots; the grand spectacle being its own strugglewith danger, and its liability to perish at any moment that theoverstrained machinery may give way! And then the object,too, of all this—that public favour may be conciliated for thetribune's<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span> harangues at a future day, and that, at the Rostra,he may still have the power of shaking the tribes, nicelybalanced<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span> as they are! And really, what may he not darewith those who, at his persuasion, have braved such perils asthese? Indeed, to confess the truth, at the funeral gamescelebrated at the tomb of his father, it was no less than thewhole Roman people that shared the dangers of the gladiatorialcombats. When the pivots had now been sufficiently workedand wearied, he gave another turn to his magnificent displays.For, upon the last day, still preserving the form of the amphitheatre,he cut the stage in two through the middle, and exhibiteda spectacle of athletes; after which, the stage beingsuddenly withdrawn on either side, he exhibited a combat,upon the same day, between such of the gladiators as hadpreviously proved victorious. And yet, with all this, Curiowas no king, no ruler of the destinies of a nation, nor yet aperson remarkable for his opulence even; seeing that he possessedno resources of his own, beyond what he could realizefrom the discord between the leading men.<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span></p><p>But let us now turn our attention to some marvels which,justly appreciated, may be truthfully pronounced to remainunsurpassed. Q. Marcius Rex,<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span> upon being commanded bythe senate to repair the Appian<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span> Aqueduct, and those of the<pb n="6353" />Anio<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span> and Tepula,<span id="ref_31"><a href="#note_31">[31]</a></span> constructed during his prætorship a newaqueduct,<span id="ref_32"><a href="#note_32">[32]</a></span> which bore his name, and was brought hither by achannel pierced through the sides of mountains. Agrippa,<span id="ref_33"><a href="#note_33">[33]</a></span>in his ædileship, united the Marcian with the Virgin<span id="ref_34"><a href="#note_34">[34]</a></span> Aqueduct,and repaired and strengthened the channels of the others.He also formed seven hundred wells, in addition to five hundredfountains, and one hundred and thirty reservoirs, manyof them magnificently adorned. Upon these works, too, heerected three hundred statues of marble or bronze, and fourhundred marble columns; and all this in the space of a singleyear! In the work<span id="ref_35"><a href="#note_35">[35]</a></span> which he has written in commemorationof his ædileship, he also informs us that public games werecelebrated for the space of fifty-nine days, and that one hundredand seventy gratuitous baths were opened. The numberof these last at Rome, has increased to an infinite<span id="ref_36"><a href="#note_36">[36]</a></span> extentsince his time.</p><p>The preceding aqueducts, however, have all been surpassedby the costly work which was more recently commenced bythe Emperor Caius,<span id="ref_37"><a href="#note_37">[37]</a></span> and completed by Claudius. Under theseprinces, the Curtian and Cærulean Waters, with the NewAnio,<span id="ref_38"><a href="#note_38">[38]</a></span> were brought from a distance of forty miles, and at sohigh a level that all the hills were supplied with water, onwhich the City is built. The sum expended on these workswas three hundred and fifty millions of sesterces. If we onlytake into consideration the abundant supply of water to thepublic, for baths, ponds, canals, household purposes, gardens,<pb n="6354" />places in the suburbs, and country-houses; and then reflectupon the distances that are traversed, the arches that have beenconstructed, the mountains that have been pierced, the valleysthat have been levelled, we must of necessity admit that thereis nothing to be found more worthy of our admiration throughoutthe whole universe.</p><p>Among the most memorable works, too, I, for my own part,should include another undertaking of the Emperor Claudius,although it was afterwards abandoned in consequence of thehatred borne him by his successor;<span id="ref_39"><a href="#note_39">[39]</a></span> I mean the channel thatwas cut through a mountain as an emissary for Lake Fucinus;<span id="ref_40"><a href="#note_40">[40]</a></span>a work which cost a sum beyond all calculation, and employeda countless multitude of workmen for many years. In thoseparts where the soil was found to be terreous, it was necessaryto pump up the water by the aid of machinery; in other parts,again, the solid rock had to be hewn through. All this, too,had to be done in the midst of darkness within; a series ofoperations which can only be adequately conceived by thosewho were witnesses of them, and which no human languagecan possibly describe.</p><p>I pass in silence the harbour that has been formed at Ostia;the various roads, too, that have been cut across mountains;the Tyrrhenian Sea separated by an embankment from LakeLucrinus;<span id="ref_41"><a href="#note_41">[41]</a></span> and vast numbers of bridges constructed at anenormous expense. Among the many other marvels, too, ofItaly, we are informed by Papirius Fabianus, a most diligentenquirer into the operations of Nature, that the marble theregrows in the quarries; and those who work in the quarriesassure us that the wounds thus inflicted upon the mountainsfill up spontaneously. If such is the fact, luxury has good<pb n="6355" />grounds for hoping that it will never be at a loss for a supplyof materials for its gratification.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">L.

In order to check the suddenrise of its waters, a design was entertained by Julius Cæsar to construct asubterranean canal from the lake into the valley of the Liris, which, unfortunately, was frustrated by his death. Claudius, however, executed the work,by cutting a gallery upwards of an English mile and a half through thelimestone rock; a work which, according to Suetonius, occupied thirtythousand workmen continually for eleven years. On opening it with amock naval combat, an accident happened in which many persons losttheir lives, and Claudius himself but narrowly escaped. The emissaryanswered its purpose for some time, and, though Nero suffered the worksto fall into decay, they were repaired by Hadrian. In the middle ages,however, the work fell in, and has not since been restored.</p><p><span id="note_41"><a href="#ref_41">41. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. iii. c. 9.</p></body>
