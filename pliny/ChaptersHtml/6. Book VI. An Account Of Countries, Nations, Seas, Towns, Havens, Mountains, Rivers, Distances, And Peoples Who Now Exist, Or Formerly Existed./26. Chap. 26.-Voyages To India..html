<div2 type="chapter" n="26" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 26.ÑVOYAGES TO INDIA.</head><p>But before we enter into any details respecting thesecountries, it will be as well to mention what Oncsicritus<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>has stated, who commanded the fleet of Alexander, and sailedfrom India<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> into the heart of Persia, and what has beenmore recently related by Juba; after which I shall speak of theroute along these seas which has been discovered in later years,and is followed at the present day. The journal of the voyageof Onesicritus and Nearchus has neither the names of thestations, nor yet the distances set down in it; and first of all,it is not sufficiently explained where Xylenepolis was, andnear what river, a place founded by Alexander, and fromwhich, upon setting out, they took their departure. Still, however, the following places are mentioned by them, which areworthy of our notice. The town of Arbis, founded by Nearchus on the occasion of this voyage; the river Nabrus,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>navigable for vessels, and opposite to it an island, at a distanceof seventy stadia; Alexandria, built by Leonnatus<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> by orderof Alexander in the territories of this people; Argenus, witha very convenient harbour; the river Tonberos,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> a navigablestream, around whose banks are the Pasir¾; then come the Ichthyophagi, who extend over so large a tract of coast that ittook thirty days<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> to sail past their territory; and an islandknown by the names of the "Island of the Sun"<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> and the "Bed<pb n="2061" />of the Nymphs," the earth of which is red, and in which everyanimal instantly dies; the cause of which, however, has not beenascertained.<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> Next to these is the nation of the Ori, and thenthe Hyctanis,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> a river of Carmania, with an excellent harbourat its mouth, and producing gold; at this spot the writersstate that for the first time they caught sight of the GreatBear.<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> The star Arcturus too, they tell us, was not to be seenhere every night, and never, when it was seen, during thewhole of it. Up to this spot extended the empire of theAch¾menid¾,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> and in these districts are to be found mines ofcopper, iron, arsenic, and red lead.</p><p>They next came to the Promontory of Carmania,<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> fromwhich the distance across to the opposite coast, where theMac¾, a nation of Arabia, dwell, is fifty miles; and then tothree islands, of which that of Oracla<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> is alone inhabited, beingthe only one supplied with fresh water; it is distant from themainland twenty-five miles; quite in the Gulf, and facingPersia, there are four other islands. About these islands sea-serpents<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> were seen swimming towards them, twenty cubitsin length, which struck the fleet with great alarm. Theythen came to the island of Athothradus, and those called theGaurat¾, upon which dwells the nation of the Gyani; theriver Hyperis,<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> which discharges itself midway into the Persian Gulf, and is navigable for merchant ships; the river<pb n="2062" />Sitiogagus, from which to Pasargad¾<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> is seven days' sail;a navigable river known as the Phristimus, and an islandwithout a name; and then the river Granis,<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> navigablefor vessels of small burden, and flowing through Susiane;the Deximontani, a people who manufacture bitumen, dwellon its right bank. The river Zarotis comes next, difficult ofentrance at its mouth, except by those who are well acquainted with it; and then two small islands; after which thefleet sailed through shallows which looked very much like amarsh, but were rendered navigable by certain channels whichhad been cut there. They then arrived at the mouth of theEuphrates, and from thence passed into a lake which is formedby the rivers Eul¾us<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> and Tigris, in the vicinity of Charax,<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span>after which they arrived at Susa,<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> on the river Tigris. Here,after a voyage of three months, they found Alexander celebra-ting a festival, seven months after he had left them at Patale.<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span>Such was the voyage performed by the fleet of Alexander.</p><p>In later times it has been considered a well-ascertainedfact that the voyage from Syagrus,<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> the Promontory ofArabia, to Patale, reckoned at thirteen hundred and thirty-five miles, can be performed most advantageously with the<pb n="2063" />aid of a westerly wind, which is there known by the nameof Hippalus.</p><p>The age that followed pointed out a shorter route, and asafer one, to those who might happen to sail from the samepromontory for Sigerus, a port of India; and for a long timethis route was followed, until at last a still shorter cut wasdiscovered by a merchant, and the thirst for gain broughtIndia even still nearer to us. At the present day voyages aremade to India every year: and companies of archers are carriedon board the vessels, as those seas are greatly infested withpirates.</p><p>It will not be amiss too, on the present occasion, to set forththe whole of the route from Egypt, which has been stated tous of late, upon information on which reliance may be placed,and is here published for the first time. The subject is one wellworthy of our notice, seeing that in no year does India drainour empire of less than five hundred and fifty millions<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span> ofsesterces, giving back her own wares in exchange, which aresold among us at fully one hundred times their prime cost.</p><p>Two miles distant from Alexandria is the town of Juliopolis.<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span>The distance thence to Coptos, up the Nile, is three hundredand eight miles; the voyage is performed, when the Etesianwinds are blowing, in twelve days. From Coptos the journeyis made with the aid of camels, stations being arranged atintervals for the supply of fresh water. The first of thesestations is called Hydreuma,<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span> and is distant<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span> twenty-twomiles; the second is situate on a mountain, at a distance of oneday's journey from the last; the third is at a second Hydreuma,<pb n="2064" />distant from Coptos ninety-five miles; the fourth is on a mountain; the next to that is at another Hydreuma, that of Apollo,and is distant from Coptos one hundred and eighty-four miles;after which, there is another on a mountain. There is thenanother station at a place called the New Hydreuma, distant fromCoptos two hundred and thirty miles: and next to it there isanother, called the Old Hydreuma, or the Troglodytic, where adetachment is always on guard, with a caravansary that affordslodging for two thousand persons. This last is distant from theNew Hydreuma seven miles. After leaving it we come to thecity of Berenice,<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span> situate upon a harbour of the Red Sea, anddistant from Coptos two hundred and fifty-seven miles. Thegreater part of this distance is generally travelled by night,on account of the extreme heat, the day being spent at thestations; in consequence of which it takes twelve days to perform the whole journey from Coptos to Berenice.</p><p>Passengers generally set sail at midsummer, before therising of the Dog-star, or else immediately after, and in aboutthirty days arrive at Ocelis<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span> in Arabia, or else at Cane,<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span> in theregion which bears frankincense. There is also a third portof Arabia, Muza<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span> by name; it is not, however, used by personson their passage to India, as only those touch at it who dealin incense and the perfumes of Arabia. More in the interior there is a city; the residence of the king there is calledSapphar,<span id="ref_31"><a href="#note_31">[31]</a></span> and there is another city known by the name ofSave. To those who are bound for India, Ocelis is the best<pb n="2065" />place for embareation. If the wind, called Hippalus,<span id="ref_32"><a href="#note_32">[32]</a></span> happens to be blowing, it is possible to arrive in forty days at thenearest mart of India, Muziris<span id="ref_33"><a href="#note_33">[33]</a></span> by name. This, however, isnot a very desirable place for disembarcation, on account of thepirates which frequent its vicinity, where they occupy aplace called Nitrias; nor, in fact, is it very rich in articlesof merchandize. Besides, the road-stead for shipping is aconsiderable distance from the shore, and the cargoes have tobe conveyed in boats, either for loading or discharging. Atthe moment that I am writing these pages, the name of theking of this place is C¾lobothras. Another port, and a muchmore convenient one, is that which lies in the territory of thepeople called Neacyndi, Barace by name. Here king Pandionused to reign, dwelling at a considerable distance from themart in the interior, at a city known as Modiera. The district from which pepper is carried down to Barace in boatshollowed out of a single tree,<span id="ref_34"><a href="#note_34">[34]</a></span> is known as Cottonara.<span id="ref_35"><a href="#note_35">[35]</a></span> Noneof these names of nations, ports, and cities are to be found inany of the former writers, from which circumstance it wouldappear that the localities have since changed their names.Travellers set sail from India on their return to Europe, at thebeginning of the Egyptian month Tybis, which is our December, or at all events before the sixth day of the Egyptian monthMechir, the same as<span id="ref_36"><a href="#note_36">[36]</a></span> our ides of January: if they do this,they can go and return in the same year. They set sail fromIndia with a south-east wind, and upon entering the Red Sea,catch the south-west or south. We will now return to ourmain subject.<pb n="2066" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See the Notes at the end of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">By descending the Indus, and going up the Persian Gulf.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Near the mouth of the Indus, Hardouin says.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">One of Alexander's most distinguished officers, and a native of Pella.He commanded the division of cavalry and light-armed troops which ac-companied the fleet of Alexander down the Indus, along the right bank ofthe river.

He is also in error, mostprobably, in making the river Eul¾us flow through Messabatene, it beingmost likely the present Mah-Sabaden, in Laristan, which is drained by theKerkbah, the ancient Choaspes, and not by the Eul¾us.</p><p><span id="note_19"><a href="#ref_19">19. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Called, for the sake of distinction, Charax Spasinu, originally foundedby Alexander the Great.

Some suppose it to have been Nicopolis, or the City ofVictory, founded by Augustus B.C. 29, partly to commemorate the reduction of Egypt to a Roman province, and partly to punish the Alexandriansfor their adhesion to the cause of Antony and Cleopatra. Mannert, however, looks upon it as having been merely that suburb of Alexandria whichStrabo (B. xvii.) calls Eleusis.</p><p><span id="note_25"><a href="#ref_25">25. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From the Greek <foreign lang="greek">u(/dreuma,</foreign> a "watering-place."</p><p><span id="note_26"><a href="#ref_26">26. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From Coptos, the modern Kouft or Keft.

Thesite of Berenice, as ascertained by Moresby and Carless, <date value="1830" authname="1830">1830</date>Ð3, was nearlyat the bottom of the inlet known as the Sinus Immundus, or Foul Bay.Its ruins still exist.</p><p><span id="note_28"><a href="#ref_28">28. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called Gehla, a harbour and emporium at the south-westernpoint of Arabia Felix.</p><p><span id="note_29"><a href="#ref_29">29. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">An emporium or promontory on the southern coast of Arabia, in thecountry of the Adramit¾, and, as Arrian says, the chief port of theincrease-bearing country. It has been identified by D'Anville with CavaCanim Bay, near a mountain called Hissan Ghorab, at the base of whichthere are ruins to be seen.</p><p><span id="note_30"><a href="#ref_30">30. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably the modern Mosch, north of Mokha, near the southernextremity of Arabia Felix.</p><p><span id="note_31"><a href="#ref_31">31. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Its ruins are now known as Dhafar.

It has beensupposed to be represented by the modern Calicut or Travancore. Cochin,however, appears to be the most likely.</p><p><span id="note_36"><a href="#ref_36">36. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Marcus observes that we may conclude that either Pliny or the authorfrom whom he transcribed, wrote this between the years of the Christianera 48 and 51; for that the coincidence of the 6th of the month Mechirwith the Ides of January, could not have taken place in any other yearthan those on which the first day of Thoth or the beginning of the yearfell on the 11th of August, which happened in the years 48, 49, 50, and 51of the Christian era.</p></body>
