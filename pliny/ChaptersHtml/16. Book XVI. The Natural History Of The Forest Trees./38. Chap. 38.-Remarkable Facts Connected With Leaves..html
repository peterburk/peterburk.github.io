<div2 type="chapter" n="38" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 38.ÑREMARKABLE FACTS CONNECTED WITH LEAVES.</head><p>The broadest leaves are those of the fig, the vine, and theplane; while those of the myrtle, the pomegranate, and theolive are narrow. The leaf of the pine and the cedar is fineand resembles hair, while that of the holly and one variety ofthe holm oak<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> is prickly-indeed, in the juniper, we find a<pb n="3378" />thorn in place of a leaf. The leaf of the cypress and the tamarisk<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> is fleshy, and that of the alder is remarkable for itsthickness.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> In the reed, the willow, and the palm,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> the leafis long, and in the latter tree it is double as well: that of thepear is rounded, and it is pointed in the apple.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> In the ivythe leaf is angular, and in the plane divided.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> In the pitch-tree<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> and the fir the leaf is indented like the teeth of a comb;while in the robur it is sinuous on the whole of the outermargin: in the bramble it has a spiny surface. In someplants the leaf has the property of stinging, the nettle for instance; while in the pine,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> the pitch-tree, the fir, the larch,the cedar, and the holly, it is prickly. In the olive and theholm-oak it has a short stalk, in the vine a long one: in thepoplar the stalk of the leaf is always quivering,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> and the leavesof this tree are the only ones that make a crackling noise<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>when coming in contact with another.</p><p>In one variety of the apple-tree<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> we find a small leaf protruding from the very middle of the fruit, sometimes, indeed,a couple of them. Then, again, in some trees the leaves arearranged all round the branches, and in others at the extremitiesof them, while in the robur they are found upon the trunkitself. They are sometimes thick and close, and at othersthinly scattered, which is more particularly the case where theleaf is large and broad. In the myrtle<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> they are symmetrically<pb n="3379" />arranged, in the box, concave, and, upon the apple, scatteredwithout any order or regularity. In the apple and the pearwe find several leaves issuing from the same stalk, and in theelm and the cytisus<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> they are covered with ramified veins.To the above particulars Cato<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> adds that the leaves of thepoplar and the quercus should not be given to cattle after theyhave fallen and become withered, and he recommends theleaves of the fig,<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> the holm-oak, and the ivy for oxen: theleaves, too, of the reed and the laurel are sometimes giventhem to eat. The leaves of the service-tree fall all at once,but in the others only by degrees. Thus much in referenceto the leaves.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Genere ilicum."
