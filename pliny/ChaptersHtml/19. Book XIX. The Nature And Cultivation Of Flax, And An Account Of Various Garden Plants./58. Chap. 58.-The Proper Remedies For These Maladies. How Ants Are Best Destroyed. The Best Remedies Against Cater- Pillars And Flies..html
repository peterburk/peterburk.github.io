<div2 type="chapter" n="58" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 58.—THE PROPER REMEDIES FOR THESE MALADIES. HOWANTS ARE BEST DESTROYED. THE BEST REMEDIES AGAINST CATER-PILLARS AND FLIES.</head><p>The same author recommends as a remedy against ants,which are by no means the slightest plague in a garden that isnot kept well watered, to stop up the mouths of their holes withsea-slime or ashes. But the most efficient way of destroyingthem is with the aid of the plant heliotropium;<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> some persons, too, are of opinion that water in which an unburnt brickhas been soaked is injurious to them. The best protection forturnips is to sow a few fitches with them, and for cabbages chickpeas, these having the effect of keeping away caterpillars. If,however, this precaution should have been omitted, and thecaterpillars have already made their appearance, the best remedyis to throw upon the vegetables a decoction of wormwood,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> orelse of house-leek,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> known to some as "aïzoüm," a kind ofherb already mentioned by us. If cabbage-seed, before it issown, is steeped in the juice of house-leek, the cabbages, it issaid, are sure not be attacked by any insect.</p><p>It is said, too, that all caterpillars may be effectually exterminated, if the skull<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> of a beast of burden is set up upon astake in the garden, care being taken to employ that of a femaleonly. There is a story related, too, that a river crab, hungup in the middle of the garden, is a preservative against theattacks of caterpillars. Again, there are some persons who arein the habit of touching with slips of blood-red cornel<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> suchplants as they wish to preserve from caterpillars. Flies,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> too,infest well-watered gardens, and more particularly so, if therehappen to be any shrubs there; they may be got rid of; how-ever, by burning galbanum.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span></p><p>(11.) With reference to the deterioration to which seed issubject,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> there are some seeds which keep better than others,<pb n="4201" />such, for instance, as that of coriander, beet, leeks, cresses,mustard, rocket, cunila, nearly all the pungent plants in fact.The seed, on the other hand, of orage, ocimum, gourds,and cucumbers, is not so good for keeping. All the summerseeds, too, last longer than the winter ones; but scallion seedis the very worst for keeping of them all. But of those, even,which keep the very longest, there is none that will keep beyond fouryears—for sowing<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> purposes, at least; for culinarypurposes, they are fit for use beyond that period.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Heliotropium Europæum of botanists.
