By some persons it is known asthe "Heraclian," and by others as the "Lydian" stone. Itis found in pieces of moderate size, and never exceeding fourinches in length by two in breadth. The side that has lainfacing the sun is superior<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> to that which has lain next to theground. Persons of experience in these matters, when theyhave scraped a particle off the ore with this stone, as with afile, can tell in a moment the proportion of gold there is in it,how much silver, or how much copper; and this to a scruple,their accuracy being so marvellous that they are never mistaken.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Literally "whetstone." He is speaking of the stone known to us asTouchstone, Lydian stone, or Basanite—"a velvet-black siliceous stone orflinty jasper, used on account of its hardness and black colour for tryingthe purity of the precious metals. The colour left on the stone after rubbingthe metal across it, indicates to the experienced eye the amount ofthe alloy." —Dana, Syst. Mineral. p. 242.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In Lydia. See B. v. cc. 30, 31.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">As a test. At the present day, concentrated nitric acid is dropped onthe mark left by the metal; and the more readily the mark is effaced, theless pure is the metal.</p></body>
