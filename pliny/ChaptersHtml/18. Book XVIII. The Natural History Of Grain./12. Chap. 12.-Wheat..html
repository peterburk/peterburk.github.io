<div2 type="chapter" n="12" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 12.—WHEAT.</head><p>There are numerous kinds of wheat which have receivedtheir names from the countries where they were first produced.For my part, however, I can compare no kind of wheat tothat of Italy either for whiteness or weight, qualities for whichit is more particularly distinguished: indeed it is only withthe produce of the more mountainous parts of Italy that theforeign wheats can be put in comparison. Among these thewheat of Bœotia<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> occupies the first rank, that of Sicily thesecond, and that of Africa the third. The wheats of Thrace,Syria, and, more recently, of Egypt, used to hold the third rankfor weight, these facts having been ascertained through themedium of the athletes; whose powers of consumption, equalto those of beasts of burden, have established the gradations inweight, as already stated. Greece, too, held the Pontic<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> wheatin high esteem; but this has not reached Italy as yet. Ofall the varieties of grain, however, the Greeks gave the preference to the kinds called dracontion, strangia, and Selinusium,the chief characteristic of which is a stem of remarkable thickness: it was this, in the opinion of the Greeks, that markedthem as the peculiar growth of a rich soil. On the other hand,they recommended for sowing in humid soils an extremelylight and diminutive species of grain, with a remarkably thinstalk, known to them as speudias, and standing in need of anabundance of nutriment. Such, at all events, were the opi-nions generally entertained in the reign of Alexander the Great,at a time when Greece was at the height of her glory, and themost powerful country in the world. Still, however, nearlyone hundred and forty-four years before the death of thatprince we find the poet Sophocles, in his Tragedy of "Triptolemus," praising the corn of Italy before all others. Thepassage, translated word for word, is to the following effect:—"And favour'd Italy grows white with hoary wheat."<lb />And it is this whiteness that is still one of the peculiar meritsof the Italian wheat; a circumstance which makes me the moresurprised to find that none of the Greek writers of a laterperiod have made any reference to it.<pb n="4026" /></p><p>Of the various kinds of wheat which are imported at thepresent day into Rome, the lightest in weight are those whichcome from Gaul and Chersonnesus; for, upon weighing them,it will be found that they do not yield more than twentypounds to the modius. The grain of Sardinia weighs half apound more, and that of Alexandria one-third of a pound morethan that of Sardinia; the Sicilian wheat is the same inweight as the Alexandrian. The Bœotian wheat, again, weighsa whole pound more than these last, and that of Africa a poundand three quarters. In Italy beyond the Padus, the spelt, tomy knowledge, weighs twenty-five pounds to the modius, and,in the vicinity of Clusium, six-and-twenty. We find it arule, universally established by Nature, that in every kind ofcommissariat bread<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> that is made, the bread exceeds the weightof the grain by one-third; and in the same way it is generallyconsidered that that is the best kind of wheat, which, inkneading, will absorb one congius of water.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> There are somekinds of wheat which give, when used by themselves, an additional weight equal to this; the Balearic wheat, for instance,which to a modius of grain yields thirty-five pounds weight ofbread. Others, again, will only give this additional weightby being mixed with other kinds, the Cyprian wheat and theAlexandrian, for example; which, if used by themselves, willyield no more than twenty pounds to the modius. The wheatof Cyprus is swarthy, and produces a dark bread; for whichreason it is generally mixed with the white wheat of Alexandria; the mixture yielding twenty-five pounds of bread to themodius of grain. The wheat of Thebais, in Egypt, æhenmade into bread, yields twenty-six pounds to the modius. Toknead the meal with sea-water, as is mostly done in the maritime districts, for the purpose of saving the salt, is extremelypernicious; there is nothing, in fact, that will more readilypredispose the human body to disease. In Gaul and Spain,where they make a drink<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> by steeping corn in the way thathas been already described—they employ the foam<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> whichthickens upon the surface as a leaven: hence it is thatthe bread in those countries is lighter than that made else-where.<pb n="4027" /></p><p>There are some differences, also, in the stem of wheat; forthe better the kind the thicker it is. In Thrace, the stem ofthe wheat is covered with several coats,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> which are renderedabsolutely necessary by the excessive cold of those regions.It is the cold, also, that led to the discovery there of the three-month<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> wheat, the ground being covered with snow mostof the year. At the end mostly of three months after it hasbeen sown, this wheat is ready for cutting, both in Thrace andin other parts of the world as well. This variety is well known,too, throughout all the Alpine range, and in the northern pro-vinces there is no kind of wheat that is more prolific; it hasa single stem only, is by no means of large size in any part ofit, and is never sown but in a thin, light soil. There is a two-month<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> wheat also found in the vicinity of Ænos, in Thrace,which ripens the fortieth day after sowing; and yet it is asurprising fact, that there is no kind of wheat that weighsheavier than this, while at the same time it produces no bran.Both Sicily and Achaia grow it, in the mountainous districtsof those countries; as also Eubœa, in the vicinity of Carystus.So greatly, then, is Columella in error,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> in supposing thatthere is no distinct variety of three-month wheat even; thefact being that these varieties have been known from the veryearliest times. The Greeks give to these wheats the nameof "setanion." It is said that in Bactria the grains of wheatare of such an enormous size, that a single one is as large asour ears of corn.<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From Theophrastus, De Causis, B. iv.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">That of the Ukraine and its vicinity, which is still held in high esteem.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Panis militaris.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">To the modius of wheat.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He alludes to beer, or sweet-wort.
