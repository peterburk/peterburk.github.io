<div2 type="chapter" n="1" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 1. (1.)—WHETHER THE WORLD BE FINITE, ANDWHETHER THERE BE MORE THAN ONE WORLD.</head><p>The world<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>, and whatever that be which we otherwise<pb n="1014" />call the heavens<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>, by the vault of which all things areenclosed,<pb n="1015" />we must conceive to be a Deity<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>, to be eternal, without bounds, neither created, nor subject, at any time, todestruction<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>. To inquire what is beyond it is no concern ofman, nor can the human mind form any conjecture respectingit. It is sacred, eternal, and without bounds, all in all; indeed including everything in itself; finite, yet like what isinfinite; the most certain of all things, yet like what is uncertain, externally and internally embracing all things initself; it is the work of nature, and itself constitutesnature<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>.</p><p>It is madness to harass the mind, as some have done, withattempts to measure the world, and to publish these attempts;or, like others, to argue from what they have made out,that there are innumerable other worlds, and that we mustbelieve there to be so many other natures, or that, if onlyone nature produced the whole, there will be so many sunsand so many moons, and that each of them will have immensetrains of other heavenly bodies. As if the same questionwould not recur at every step of our inquiry, anxious as wemust be to arrive at some termination; or, as if this infinity,which we ascribe to nature, the former of all things, cannotbe more easily comprehended by one single formation,<pb n="1016" />especially when that is so extensive. It is madness, perfectmadness, to go out of this world and to search for what isbeyond it, as if one who is ignorant of his own dimensionscould ascertain the measure of any thing else, or as if thehuman mind could see what the world itself cannot contain.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Mundus." In translating from one language into another, it isproper, as a general principle, always to render the same word in theoriginal by the same word in the translation. But to this rule there aretwo exceptions; where the languages do not possess words which precisely correspond, and where the original author does not always use thesame word in the same sense. Both these circumstances, I apprehend,apply to the case in question. The term <hi rend="ital">Mundus</hi> is used by <placeName key="tgn,2588096" authname="tgn,2588096">Pliny</placeName>,sometimes to mean <hi rend="ital">the earth</hi> and its immediate appendages, the visiblesolar system; and at other times <hi rend="ital">the universe;</hi> while I think we mayventure to assert, that in some instances it is used in rather a vaguemanner, without any distinct reference to either one or other of the abovedesignations. I have, in almost all cases, translated it by the term <hi rend="ital">world,</hi>as approaching nearest to the sense of the original. The word <hi rend="ital">mundus</hi>is frequently employed by Lucretius, especially in his fifth book, andseems to be almost always used in the more extended sense of <hi rend="ital">universe.</hi>There are, indeed, a few passages where either meaning would be equallyappropriate, and in one line it would appear to be equivalent to<hi rend="ital">firmament</hi> or <hi rend="ital">heavens;</hi> "et mundi speciem violareserenam," iv. 138. <placeName key="tgn,2068515" authname="tgn,2068515">Cicero</placeName>,in his treatise De Natura Deorum, generally uses the term <hi rend="ital">mundus</hi> in thesense of <hi rend="ital">universe,</hi> as in ii. 22, 37, 58 and 154; while in one passage, ii.132, it would appear to be employed in the more limited sense of <hi rend="ital">the</hi><hi rend="ital">earth.</hi> It occasionally occurs in the Fasti of <placeName key="tgn,2071526" authname="tgn,2071526">Ovid</placeName>, but it is not easy toascertain its precise import; as in the line "Post chaos, ut primum datasunt tria corpora mundo," v. 41, where from the connexion it may betaken either in the more confined or in the more general sense. Maniliusemploys the word very frequently, and his commentators remark, that heuses it in two distinct senses, <hi rend="ital">the visible firmament</hi> and the <hi rend="ital">universe;</hi> andI am induced to think that he attaches still more meaning to the term.It occurs three times in the first eleven lines of his poem. In the thirdline, "deducere mundo aggredior," <hi rend="ital">mundus</hi> may be considered asequivalent to the celestial regions as opposed to the earth. In theninthline,"concessumque patri mundo," we may consider it as signifying thecelestial regions generally; and in the eleventh, "Jamque favet mundus,"the whole of the earth, or rather its inhabitants. We meet with it againin the sixty-eighth line, "lumina mundi," where it seems more properlyto signify the visible firmament; again in the 139th, "Et mundi struxereglobum," it seems to refer especially to the earth, synonymous with thegeneral sense of the English term <hi rend="ital">world;</hi> while in the 153rd line, "perinania mundi," it must be supposed to mean the universe. Hyginus,in his Poeticon Astronomicon, lib. i. p. 55, defines the term as follows:"Mundus appellatur is qui constat in sole et luna et terra et omnibusstellis;" and again, p. 57, "Terra mundi media regione collocata." We mayobserve the different designations of the term <hi rend="ital">mundus</hi> in <placeName key="tgn,1002883" authname="tgn,1002883">Seneca</placeName>; amongother passages I may refer to his Nat. Quæst. vii. 27 &amp; iii. 30; to histreatise De Consol. § 18 and De Benef. iv. 23, where I conceive the precisemeanings are, respectively, the universe, the terrestrial globe, the firmament, and the heavenly bodies. The Greek term <foreign lang="greek">ko/smos,</foreign> which correspondsto the Latin word <hi rend="ital">mundus,</hi> was likewise employed to signify, either thevisible firmament or the universe. In illustration of this, it willbe sufficient to refer to the treatise of Aristotle <foreign lang="greek">Peri\ Ko/smou,</foreign> cap. 2. p. 601. Seealso Stephens's Thesaurus, <hi rend="ital">in loco.</hi> In Apuleius's treatise De Mundo,which is a free translation of Aristotle's <foreign lang="greek">Peri\ Ko/smou,</foreign> the term may beconsidered as synonymous with universe. It is used in the same sensein various parts of Apuleius's writings: see Metam. ii. 23; De DeoSocratis, 665, 667; De Dogmate Platonis, 574, 575, <hi rend="ital">et alibi.</hi></p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot"><placeName key="tgn,2239742" authname="tgn,2239742">Cicero</placeName>, in his Timæus, uses the same phraseology; "Omne igiturcœlum, sive mundus, sive quovis alio vocabulo gaudet, hoc a nobisnuncupatum est," § 2. Pomponius Mela's work commences with asimilar expression; "Omne igitur hoc, quidquid est, cui mundi cœliquenomen indideris, unum id est." They were probably taken from apassage in Plato's Timæus, "Universum igitur hoc, Cœlum, sive Mundum,sive quo alio vocabulo gaudet, cognominemus," according to thetranslation of Ficinus; Platonis Op. ix. p. 302. The word <hi rend="ital">cœlum,</hi>which isemployed in the original, in its ordinary acceptation, signifies<hi rend="ital">the heavens,</hi>the visible firmament; as in <placeName key="tgn,2562922" authname="tgn,2562922">Ovid</placeName>, Met. i. 5, "quod tegit omnia, cœlum."It is, in most cases, employed in this sense by Lucretius and by Manilius,as in i. 2. of the former and in i. 14. of the latter. Occasionally, however, it is employed by both of these writers in the more general senseof <hi rend="ital">celestial regions,</hi> in opposition to the earth, as by Lucretius, i. 65, andby Manilius, i. 352. In the line quoted by <placeName key="tgn,2036187" authname="tgn,2036187">Cicero</placeName> from Pacuvius, itwould seem to mean the place in which the planets are situated; DeNat. Deor. ii. 91. The Greek word <foreign lang="greek">ou)rano\s</foreign> may be regarded as exactlycorresponding to the Latin word <hi rend="ital">cœlum,</hi> and employed with the samemodifications; see Aristotle, De Mundo and De Cœlo, and Ptolemy,Mag. Const. lib. i. <hi rend="ital">passim;</hi> see also Stephens's Thesaurus,<hi rend="ital">in loco.</hi> Aratusgenerally uses it to designate the visible firmament, as in 1. 10, while in1. 32 it means the heavenly regions. <placeName key="tgn,2348207" authname="tgn,2348207">Gesner</placeName> defines <hi rend="ital">cœlum,</hi> "Mundusexclusa terra," and <hi rend="ital">mundus,</hi> "Cœlum et quidquid cceli ambitucontinetur." In the passage from Plato, referred to above, the wordswhichare translated by Ficinus <hi rend="ital">cœlum</hi> and <hi rend="ital">mundus,</hi> are inthe original <foreign lang="greek">ou)rano\s</foreign>and <foreign lang="greek">ko/smos;</foreign> Ficinus, however, in various parts of the Timæus, translates<foreign lang="greek">ou)ranbo\s</foreign> by the word <hi rend="ital">mundus:</hi> see t. ix. p. 306, 311, <hi rend="ital">et alibi.</hi></p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The following passage from <placeName key="tgn,2036187" authname="tgn,2036187">Cicero</placeName> may serve to illustrate the doctrineof <placeName key="tgn,2119609" authname="tgn,2119609">Pliny</placeName>: "Novem tibi orbibus, vel potius globis, connexa sunt omnia:quorum unus est ccelestis, extimus, qui reliquos omnes complectitur,summus ipse Deus, arcens et continens cœlum;" Som.
