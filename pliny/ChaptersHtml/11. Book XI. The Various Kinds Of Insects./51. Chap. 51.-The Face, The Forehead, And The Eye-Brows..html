Other animals have a forehead as well, but it is only on the forehead of man that isdepicted sorrow, gladness, compassion, or severity. It is theforehead that is the index of the mind. Man has eyebrows,also, which move together or alternately; these, too, serve insome measure as indications of the feelings. Do we deny ordo we assent, it is the eyebrows, mostly, that indicate ourintentions. Feelings of pride may be generated elsewhere,but it is here that they have their principal abode; it is in theheart that they take their rise, but it is to the eyebrows thatthey mount, and here they take up their position. In no partof the body could they meet with a spot more lofty and moreprecipitous, in which to establish themselves free from allcontrol.</p></div2></body>
