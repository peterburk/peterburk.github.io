<div2 type="chapter" n="12" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 12. (10.)—TURTLES. <span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> THE VARIOUS KINDS OF TURTLES,AND HOW THEY ARE CAUGHT.</head><p>The Indian Sea<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> produces turtles of such vast<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> size, thatwith the shell of a single animal they are able to roof a habit-<pb n="2378" />able cottage;<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and among the islands of the Red Sea, the navigation is mostly carried on in boats formed of these shells.They are to be caught in many ways; but they are generallytaken when they have come up to the surface of the waterjust before midday, a season at which they experience greatdelight in floating on the calm surface, with the back entirelyout of the water. Here the delightful sensations<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> which attend a free respiration beguile them to such a degree, andrender them so utterly regardless of their safety, that theirshell becomes dried up by the heat of the sun, so much so, indeed, that they are unable to descend, and, having to floatagainst their will, become an easy prey to the fishermen. Itis said also, that they leave the water at night for the purposeof feeding, and eat with such avidity as to quite glut themselves: upon which, they become weary, and the momentthat, on their return in the morning, they reach the sea,they fall asleep on the surface of the water. The noiseof their snoring betrays them, upon which the fishermenstealthily swim towards the animals, three to each turtle;two of them, in a moment, throw it on its back, while a thirdslings a noose around it, as it lies face upwards, and thensome more men, who are ready on shore, draw it to land.</p><p>In the Phoenician Sea they are taken without the slightestdifficulty, and, at stated periods of the year, come of their ownaccord to the river Eleutherus,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> in immense numbers. The turtle has no teeth, but the edge of the mouth is sharp, the upperpart shutting down over the lower just like the lid of a box.In the sea it lives upon shell-fish,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> and such is the strength of itsjaws, that it is able to break stones even; when on shore, itfeeds upon herbage. The female turtle lays eggs like those ofbirds, one hundred in number; these she buries on the dryland, and covering them over with earth, pats it down with herbreast, and then having thus rendered it smooth, sits on themduring the night. The young are hatched in the course of a<pb n="2379" />year. Some persons are of opinion that they hatch their eggsby means of the eyes, by merely looking at them, and that thefemale refuses to have any intercourse with the male until hehas placed a wisp of straw<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> upon her back. The Troglodytæhave turtles with horns,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> which resemble the branches of alyre; they are large, but moveable, and assist the animal like somany oars while swimming. The name of this fine, but rarely-found turtle, is "chelyon;"<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> for the rocks, from the sharpness of their points, frighten away the Chelonophagi,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> whilethe Troglodytæ, whose shores these animals frequent, worshipthem as sacred. There are some land turtles also, the shellsof which, used for the purposes of art, are thence called bythe name of "chersinæ;<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> they are found in the deserts ofAfrica, in the parts where the scorched sands are more especially destitute of water, and subsist, it is believed, upon themoisture of the dews. No other animal is to be found there.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We may here remark, that Pliny throughout calls these animals"testudines,"—"tortoises."
