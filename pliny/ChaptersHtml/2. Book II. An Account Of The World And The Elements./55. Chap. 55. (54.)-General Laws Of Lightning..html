<div2 type="chapter" n="55" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 55. (54.)—GENERAL LAWS OF LIGHTNING.</head><p>It is certain that the lightning is seen before the thunderis heard, although they both take place at the same time.Nor is this wonderful, since light has a greater velocity thansound. Nature so regulates it, that the stroke and the soundcoincide<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>; the sound is, however, produced by the dischargeof the thunder, not by its stroke. But the air is impelled<pb n="1085" />quicker than the lightning<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>, on which account it is that everythingis shaken and blown up before it is struck, and that aperson is never injured when he has seen the lightning andheard the thunder. Thunder on the left hand is supposedto be lucky, because the east is on the left side of the heavens<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>.We do not regard so much the mode in which it comesto us, as that in which it leaves us, whether the fire reboundsafter the stroke, or whether the current of air returns whenthe operation is concluded and the fire is consumed. In relation to this object the Etrurians have divided the heavens intosixteen parts<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>. The first great division is from north to east;the second to the south; the third to the west, and the fourthoccupies what remains from west to north. Each of these hasbeen subdivided into four parts, of which the eight on the easthave been called the left, and those on the west the right divisions. Those which extend from the west to the north havebeen considered the most unpropitious. It becomes thereforevery important to ascertain from what quarter the thunderproceeds, and in what direction it falls. It is considered avery favourable omen when it returns into the eastern divisions. But it prognosticates the greatest felicity when thethunder proceeds from the first-mentioned part of the heavensand falls back into it; it was an omen of this kind which, as wehave heard, was given to Sylla, the Dictator. The remainingquarters of the heavens are less propitious, and also less tobe dreaded. There are some kinds of thunder which it isnot thought right to speak of, or even to listen to, unlesswhen they have been disclosed to the master of a family orto a parent. But the futility of this observation was detected whenthe temple of Juno was struck at Rome, during<pb n="1086" />the consulship of Scaurus, he who was afterwards the Princeof the Senate<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>.</p><p>It lightens without thunder more frequently in the nightthan in the day<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>. Man is the only animal that is not alwayskilled by it, all other animals being killed instantly, naturehaving granted to him this mark of distinction, while so manyother animals excel him in strength. All animals fall downon the opposite side to that which has been struck; man,unless he be thrown down on the parts that are struck, doesnot expire. Those who are struck directly from above sinkdown immediately. When a man is struck while he is awake,he is found with his eyes closed; when asleep, with themopen. It is not considered proper that a man killed in thisway should be burnt on the funeral pile; our religion enjoinsus to bury the body in the earth<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>. No animal is consumedby lightning unless after having been previously killed.The parts of the animal that have been wounded by lightning are colder than the rest of the body.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"ictum autem et sonitum congruere, ita modulante natura."
