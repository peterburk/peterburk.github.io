What is still more, too, there is a love-story about thisanimal. At ®gium one is said to have conceived a passion fora beautiful boy, a native of Olenos,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and another for Glauce,a damsel who was lute-player to King Ptolemy; for whom atthe same time a ram is said also to have conceived a passion.One might almost be tempted to think that these creatureshave an appreciation of wisdom:<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> for it is said, that one of<pb n="2499" />them was the constant companion of the philosopher, Lacydes,and would never leave him, either in public or when at the bath,by night or by day.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">When the Capitol was besieged by the Gauls.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Near Patr¾, m Achaia. ®lian gives his name as Amphilochus.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A singular quality in a goose. ®lian says, that Lacydes was a peripatetic philosopher, and that he honoured the goose with splendid obsequies,when it died.</p></body>
