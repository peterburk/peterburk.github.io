<div2 type="chapter" n="3" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 3.—THE JEWEL OF PYRRBUS.</head><p>Next in note after this ring, is the jewel that belonged to<pb n="6388" />another king, Pyrrhus, who was so long at war with the Romans.It is said that there was in his possession an agate,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> upon whichwere to be seen the Nine Muses and Apollo holding a lyre; nota work of art, but the spontaneous produce of Nature,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> the veinsin it being so arranged that each of the Muses had her ownpeculiar attribute.</p><p>With the exception of these two jewels, authors make nomention of any others that have been rendered famous. Weonly find it recorded by them, that Ismenias the flute-player<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>was in the habit of displaying great numbers of glitteringstones, a piece of vanity, on his part, which gave occasion tothe following story. An emerald,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> upon which was engraveda figure of Amymone,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> being offered for sale in the Isle ofCyprus at the price of six golden denarii, he gave orders topurchase it. The dealer however, reduced the price, andreturned two denarii; upon which, Ismenias remarked—"ByHercules! he has done me but a bad turn in this, for the meritof the stone has been greatly impaired by this reduction inprice."</p><p>It seems to have been this Ismenias who introduced theuniversal practice among musicians of proclaiming their artisticmerit by this kind of ostentation. Thus Dionysodorus, forinstance, his contemporary and rival, imitated his example,in order that he might not appear to be his inferior in skill;whereas, in reality, he only held the third rank among themusicians of that day. Nicomachus, too, it is said, was thepossessor of great numbers of precious stones, though selectedwith but little taste. In mentioning these illustrations, by wayof prelude to this Book, it is by no means improbable that theymay have the appearance of being addressed to those, who,piquing themselves upon a similar display, become puffed upwith a vanity which is evidently much more appropriate to aperformer on the flute.<pb n="6389" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Achates."
