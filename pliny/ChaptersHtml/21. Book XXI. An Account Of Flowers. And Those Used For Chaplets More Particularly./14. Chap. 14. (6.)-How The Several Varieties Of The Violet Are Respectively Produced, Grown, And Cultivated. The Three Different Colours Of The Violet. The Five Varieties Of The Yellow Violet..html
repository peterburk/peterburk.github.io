THE THREE DIFFERENT COLOURS OF THE VIOLET. THE FIVE VARIETIES OF THE YELLOW VIOLET.</head><p>Next after the roses and the lilies, the violet is held in thehighest esteem: of this there are several varieties, the purple,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> the yellow, and the white, all of them reproduced fromplants, like the cabbage. The purple violet, which springsup spontaneously in sunny spots, with a thin, meagre soil, haslarger petals than the others, springing immediately from theroot, which is of a fleshy substance. This violet has a name,too, distinct from the other wild kinds, being called "ion,"<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>and from it the ianthine<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> cloth takes its name.</p><p>Among the cultivated kinds, the yellow<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> violet is held in thegreatest esteem. The Tusculan violet, and that known as the<pb n="4318" />"marine"<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> violet, have petals somewhat broader than theothers, but not so odoriferous; the Calatian<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> violet, too, whichhas a smaller leaf, is entirely destitute of smell. This last isa present to us from the autumn, the others from the spring.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Viola odorata of Linnæus.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Greek name.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Ianthina vestis," violet-coloured.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Desfontaines identifies this with the Cheiranthus Cheiri; but Fée saysthat there is little doubt that it belongs to the Viola tricolor herbensis(pansy, or heart's-ease), in the petals of which the yellow predominates,and the type of which is the field violet, or Viola arvensis, the flowers ofwhich are extremely small, and entirely yellow.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This has been identified with the Cheiranthus incanus, the Cheiranthustricuspidatus of the shores of the Mediterranean, the Hesperis maritima ofLinnæus; also, by some commentators, with the Campanula Medium ofLinnæus.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">So called, according to Pintianus and Salmasius, from Calatia, a townof Italy. Fée adopts the reading "Calathiana," and considers it to havereceived that name from its resemblance to the Caltha mentioned in thenext Chapter. Dalechamps identifies it with the Digitalis purpurea;Gessner, Dodonæus, and Thalius, with the Gentiana pneumonanthe, otherswith the Gentiana ciliata and Pannonica, and Sprengel with the Gentianaverna of Linnæus. Fée admits himself totally at a loss on the subject.</p></body>
