<div2 type="chapter" n="16" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 16. (7.)ÑTHAT THERE WERE STATUARIES IN ITALY ALSOAT AN EARLY PERIOD.</head><p>Various circumstances prove, that the art of making statueswas commonly practised in Italy at an early period. Thestatue in the Cattle Market<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> is said to have been consecratedto Hercules by Evander; it is called the triumphal Hercules,and, on the occasion of triumphal processions, is arrayed intriumphal vestments. And then besides, King Numa dedicatedthe statue of the two-faced Janus;<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> a deity who isworshipped as presiding over both peace and war. Thefingers, too, are so formed as to indicate three hundred andsixty-five days,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> or in other words, the year; thus denotingthat he is the god of time and duration.</p><p>There are also Etruscan statues dispersed in various partsof the world, which beyond a doubt were originally made inEtruria. I should have supposed that these had been thestatues only of divinities, had not Metrodorus<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> of Scepsis, whohad his surname from his hatred to the Roman name,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> reproachedus with having pillaged the city of Volsinii for thesake of the two thousand statues which it contained. Itappears to me a singular fact. that although the origin ofstatues was of such great antiquity in Italy, the images of thegods, which were consecrated to them in their temples, shouldhave been formed either of wood or of earthenware,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> untilthe conquest of Asia, which introduced luxury among us. Itwill be the best plan to enlarge upon the origin of the art ofexpressing likenesses, when we come to speak of what the<pb n="6163" />Greeks call "plastice;"<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> for the art of modelling was prior tothat of statuary. This last, however, has flourished to such anextraordinary degree, that an account of it would fill manyvolumes, if we were desirous of making an extensive acquaintancewith the subject: but as to learning everything connectedwith it, who could do it?</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Forum Boarium."

We are informedthat some MSS. of Pliny give the number three hundred and fifty-five only,and there is reason to believe that, in the time of Numa, this was consideredto be the actual number of days in the year. Some of the commentators,however, are disposed to read three hundred and sixty-five; and this opinionderives some support from Macrobius, who refers to this statue as indicatingthis latter number with its fingers.ÑB. The Bamberg MS. gives threehundred and sixty-five.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See end of B. iii.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Misorom¾us"Ñ"Roman-hater."
