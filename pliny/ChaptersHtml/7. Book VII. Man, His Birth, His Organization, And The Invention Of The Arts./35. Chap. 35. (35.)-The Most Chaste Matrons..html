(35.)—THE MOST CHASTE MATRONS.</head><p>Sulpicia, the daughter of Paterculus, and wife of FulviusFlaccus, has been considered, in the judgment of matrons, tohave been the chastest of women. She was selected from onehundred Roman ladies, who had been previously named, todedicate a statue of Venus, in obedience to the precepts contained in the Sibylline books.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> Again, Claudia gave strongproof of her piety and virtue, on the occasion of the introduction into Rome of the Mother of the gods.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We have this anecdote related by Valerius Maximus, B. viii. c. 15.He informs us, that it was the statue of Venus Verticordia which wasordered to be consecrated; the more readily to win the hearts of themaidens and matrons from wanton thoughts to a life of chastity.—B.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Her story is told at great length by Ovid, in the Fasti, B. iv. 1. 305,<hi rend="ital">et seq.</hi> Her name was Claudia Quinta, and she is supposed to have beenthe sister of Appius Claudius Pulcher, and grand-daughter of Appius Claudius Cæcus. The vessel which was conveying the statue of Cybele fromPessinus to Rome having stuck fast on a shallow at the mouth of the Tiber,the soothsayers declared that none but a really chaste woman could moveit. Claudia, who had been previously accused of unchastity, being in thenumber of the matrons who had accompanied Scipio to Ostia to receive thestatue, immediately presented herself, and calling upon the goddess to vindicate her innocence, seized the rope, and the vessel moved forthwith. Astatue was afterwards erected to her in the vestibule of the temple of thegoddess.</p></body>
