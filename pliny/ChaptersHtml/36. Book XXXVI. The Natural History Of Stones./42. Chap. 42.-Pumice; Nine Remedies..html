But the genuinepumice-stones, that are in use for imparting smoothness to theskin of females, and not females only, but men as well, and, asCatullus<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> says, for polishing books, are found of the finest qualityin the islands of Melos and Nisyros<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and in the Æolian Isles.To be good, they should be white, as light as possible, porous anddry in the extreme, friable, and free from sand when rubbed.</p><p>Considered medicinally, pumice is of a resolvent and desiccativenature; for which purpose it is submitted to calcination,no less than three times, on a fire of pure charcoal, it beingquenched as often in white wine. It is then washed, likecadmia,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> and, after being dried, is put by for keeping, in aplace as free from damp as possible. In a powdered state,pumice is used in ophthalmic preparations more particularly,and acts as a lenitive detergent upon ulcerations of the eyes.It also makes new flesh upon cicatrizations of those organs,and removes all traces of the marks. Some prefer, after thethird calcination, leaving the pumice to cool, and then trituratingit in wine. It is employed also as an ingredient in emollientpoultices, being extremely useful for ulcerations on the headand generative organs; dentifrices, too, are prepared from it.According to Theophrastus,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> persons when drinking for a wagerare in the habit<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> of taking powdered pumice first; but theyrun great risk, he says, if they fail to swallow the wholedraught of wine at once; it being of so refrigerative a nature<pb n="6367" />that grape-juice<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> will absolutely cease to boil if pumice is putinto it.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See Note 90 above.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "temples of the Muses;" evidently grottos in the present instance.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In allusion to the line, "Aridâ modo pumice expolitum"—"Justpolished with dry pumice-stone."
