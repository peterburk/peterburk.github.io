(12.)—SCOLEX OF COPPER; EIGHTEEN REMEDIES.</head><p>There is another kind of verdigris also, which is called"scolex."<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> It is prepared by triturating in a mortar of<pb n="6198" />Cyprian copper, alum and salt, or an equal quantity of nitre,with the very strongest white vinegar. This preparation isonly made during the hottest days of the year, about therising of the Dog-star. The whole is triturated until it becomesgreen, and assumes the appearance of small worms, towhich it owes its name. This repulsive form is corrected bymixing the urine of a young child, with twice the quantity ofvinegar. Scolex is used for the same medicinal purposes assanterna, which we have described as being used for solderinggold,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and they have, both of them, the same properties asverdigris. Native scolex is also procured by scraping thecopper ore of which we are about to speak.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From the Greek <foreign lang="greek">skwlh\c</foreign>, "a worm," "Vermicular Verdigris."—"The accounts of this substance in ancient authors seem to some commentatorsto be obscure; but in my opinion we are to understand by themthat the ingredients were pounded together till the paste they formed assumedthe appearance of pieces or threads like worms.
