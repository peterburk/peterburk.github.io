<div2 type="chapter" n="15" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 15.—LASERPITIUM, LASER, AND MASPETUM.</head><p>Next to these, laserpitium<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> claims our notice, a very re-<pb n="4145" />markable plant, known to the Greeks by the name of "silphion," and originally a native of the province of Cyrenaica.The juice of this plant is called "laser," and it is greatly invogue for medicinal as well as other purposes, being sold atthe same rate as silver. For these many years past, however,it has not been found in Cyrenaica,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> as the farmers of therevenue who hold the lands there on lease, have a notion thatit is more profitable to depasture flocks of sheep upon them.Within the memory of the present generation, a single stalk<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>is all that has ever been found there, and that was sent as acuriosity to the Emperor Nero. If it so happen that one ofthe flock, while grazing, meets with a growing shoot<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> of it, thefact is easily ascertained by the following signs; the sheep, aftereating of it, immediately falls asleep, while the goat is seizedwith a fit of sneezing.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> For this long time past, there hasbeen no other laser imported into this country, but that produced in either Persis, Media, or Armenia, where it grows inconsiderable abundance, though much inferior<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> to that of Cyrenaica; and even then it is extensively adulterated with gum,sacopenium,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> or pounded beans. I ought the less then to<pb n="4146" />omit the facts, that in the consulship<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> of C. Valerius and M.Herennius, there was brought to Rome, from Cyrenæ, for thepublic service, thirty pounds' weight of laserpitium, and thatthe Dictator Cæsar, at the beginning of the Civil War, tookfrom out of the public treasury, besides gold and silver, noless than fifteen hundred pounds of laserpitium.</p><p>We find it stated by the most trustworthy among the Greekwriters,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> that this plant first made its appearance in the vicinityof the gardens of the Hesperides and the Greater Syrtis, immediately after the earth had been soaked on a sudden by ashower as black as pitch. This took place seven years beforethe foundation of the city of Cyrenæ, and in the year of Rome143. The virtues of this remarkable fall of rain extended,it is said, over no less than four thousand stadia of the Africanterritory; and upon this soil laserpitium began universally togrow, a plant that is in general wild and stubborn, and which,it attempted to be cultivated, will leave the spot where it hasbeen sown quite desolate and barren. The roots of it arenumerous and thick, the stalk being like that of fennel-giant,and of similar thickness. The leaves of this plant were knownas "maspetum," and bore a considerable resemblance to parsley;the seeds of it were foliaceous, and the plant shed its leavesevery year. They used to feed the cattle there upon it; atfirst it purged them, but afterwards they would grow fat, theflesh being improved in flavour in a most surprising degree.After the fall of the leaf, the people themselves were in thehabit of eating<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> the stalk, either roasted or boiled: from thedrastic effects of this diet the body was purged for the firstforty days, all vicious humours being effectually removed.<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span></p><p>The juices of this plant were collected two different ways,either from the root or from the stalk; in consequence of whichthese two varieties of the juice were known by the distinguish-ing names of "rhizias" and "caulias,"<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> the last being of inferior quality to the other, and very apt to turn putrid. Upon<pb n="4147" />the root there was a black bark, which was extensively employed for the purposes of adulteration. The juice of theplant was received in vessels, and mixed there with a layer ofbran; after which, from time to time it was shaken, till it hadreached a proper state of maturity; indeed, if this precautionwas neglected, it was apt to turn putrid. The signs that ithad come to maturity were its colour, its dryness, and the absorption of all humidity.</p><p>There are some authors, however, who state that the root oflaserpitium was more than a cubit in length, and that it presented a tuberosity above the surface of the earth. An incision,they say, was made in this tuberosity, from which a juice wouldflow, like milk in appearance; above the tuberosity grew astalk, to which they give the name of "magydaris;"<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> theleaves that grew upon this stalk were of the colour of gold, and,falling at the rising of the Dog-star, when the south windsbegin to prevail, they acted as seed for the purposes of reproduction. It was from these leaves, too, they say, that laserpitium<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> was produced, the root and the stalk attaining theirfull growth in the space of one year. The same writers alsostate, that it was the practice to turn up the ground about theplant, and that it had no such effect as purging the cattle thatwere fed upon it; though one result of using it as food was,that such cattle as were ailing were either cured of their distempers, or else died immediately upon eating of it, a thing,however, that but rarely happened. The first description,however, is found to agree more nearly with the silphiumthat comes from Persis.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Possibly the Ferula asafœtida of Linnæus; or, according to some, theThapsia silphium of Viviani, <hi rend="ital">Flor. Lib.</hi> It was a plant common, accord-ing to ancient writers, to Syria, Armenia, Media, and Liba; but it wasthe produce of this last country, probably, that afforded the juice or gumresin here mentioned as "laser," and so highly esteemed by the ancients, asforming a component part of their perfumes. Fée is inclined to thinkthat the Laserpitium here spoken of was the Thapsia silphium, and toreject the more general opinion that it is identical with the Ferula asafœtida. Pliny has probably caused some confusion by blending the description of other writers with that given by Theophrastus, each havingin view a different plant. Indeed, whatever the Laserpitium or Silphiumof other countries may have been, it is not improbable that the odoriferousplant of Cyrenaica was not identical with the Ferula asafœtida of Linnæus.The foliage of the Thapsia silphium is exactly similar to that of theLaserpitium as depicted on medals of Cyrenaica, still extant. We learnfrom Littré, that Dr. Guyon showed, in <date value="1842" authname="1842">1842</date>, to the Académie desSciences, a plant which the Arabs of Algeria employ as a purgative, andwhich they call <hi rend="ital">bonnefa.</hi> It is the Thapsia Garganica of Desfontaines,and is considered by Guyon to be identical with the Silphium of theancients.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxii. c. 48.
