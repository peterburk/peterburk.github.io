In theisland of Myconus,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> the people are born without hair, justas at Caunus the inhabitants are afflicted with the spleen<pb n="3047" />from their birth.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> There are some animals, also, that are naturally bald, such as the ostrich, for instance, and the aquaticraven, which last has thence derived its Greek<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> name. It isbut rarely that the hair falls off in women, and in eunuchssuch is never known to be the case; nor yet does any personlose it before having known sexual intercourse.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> The hairdoes not fall off below the brain, nor yet beneath the crown ofthe head, or around the ears and the temples. Man is theonly animal that becomes bald, with the exception, of course,of such animals as are naturally so. Man and the horse arethe only creatures whose hair turns grey; but with man this isalways the case, first in the fore-part of the head, and then inthe hinder part.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "long-haired."
