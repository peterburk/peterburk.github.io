It is first saturated withwine, and then calcined, the fire being kept up with thebellows till the stone is brought to a red heat; which done, itis quenched in sweet wine. This operation is repeated threetimes. The only use made of it is for dyeing cloths.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Dioscorides says that it was found in Cappadocia also; and both heand Galen attribute to it certain medicinal properties. It was used eitherfor colouring, or else, like fuller's earth, for taking the grease out of wooland cloth. Ajasson is inclined to think that it was either a volcanic scoriaor a Peperite, also of volcanic origin.</p></body>
