It is then pulled up by the roots,made up into small sheaves that will just fill the hand, andhung to dry in the sun. It is suspended with the rootsupwards the first day, and then for the five following days theheads of the sheaves are placed, reclining one against the other,in such a way that the seed which drops out may fall into themiddle. Linseed is employed for various medicinal<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> purposes,and it is used by the country-people of Italy beyond the Padusin a certain kind of food, which is remarkable for its sweet-<pb n="4136" />ness: for this long time past, however, it has only been in generaluse for sacrifices offered to the divinities. After the wheatharvest is over, the stalks of flax are plunged in water thathas been warmed in the sun, and are then submitted to pressure with aweight; for there is nothing known that is morelight and buoyant than this. When the outer coat is loosened,it is a sign that the stalks have been sufficiently steeped; afterwhich<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> they are again turned with the heads downwards, andleft to dry as before in the sun: when thoroughly dried, theyare beaten with a tow-mallet on a stone.</p><p>The part that lies nearest to the outer coat is known by thename of "stuppa;" it is a flax of inferior quality, and ismostly employed for making the wicks of lamps. This, however,requires to be combed out with iron hatchels, until thewhole of the outer skin is removed. The inner part presentsnumerous varieties of flax, esteemed respectively in proportion totheir whiteness and their softness. Spinning flax isheld to be an honourable<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> employment for men even: thehusks, or outer coats, are employed for heating furnaces andovens. There is a certain amount of skill required in hatchellingflax and dressing it: it is a fair proportion for fifty poundsin the sheaf to yield fifteen pounds of flax combed out. Whenspun into thread, it is rendered additionally supple by beingsoaked in water and then beaten out upon a stone; and afterit is woven into a tissue, it is again beaten with heavy maces:indeed, the more roughly it is treated the better it is.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is the mucilage of the perisperm that is so useful in medicine.As an article of food, the farina of linseed is held in no esteem whatever.In times of scarcity, attempts have been made to mix it with flour or meal,but the result has been found to be heavy and indigestible, and has caused,it is said, the death even of those who have eaten of it in considerablequantities.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There are various other methods employed of dressing flax at thepresent day; but they are all of them long and tedious.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">And not feminine or servile.</p></body>
