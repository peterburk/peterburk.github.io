To the GreaterArmenia, which in the front slopes towards Commagene, isjoined Sophene, which lies upon the descent<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> on both sidesthereof, and next to it is Adiabene, the most advanced frontierof Assyria; a part of which is Arbelitis,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> He alludes to the town of Arbela, where, as it is generally said, thearmy of Darius was defeated by Alexander the Great; by which engage-ment the conflict was terminated. It was the fact, however, that Dariusleft his baggage and treasures at Arbela, while the battle really took placenear the village of Gaugamela, about twenty miles to the north-west ofArbela. This place still retains its name of Arbil, where Alexander con-quered Darius, and which joins up to Syria. The whole of thiscountry was called Mygdonia by the Macedonians, on account ofthe resemblance it bore to Mygdonia<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> in Europe. Its cities areAlexandria,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and Antiochia, also called Nisibis;<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> this lastplace is distant from Artaxata seven hundred and fifty miles.There was also in former times Ninus,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> a most renowned city,on the banks of the Tigris, with an aspect towards the west.Adjoining the other front of Greater Armenia, which runsdown towards the Caspian Sea, we find Atropatene,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> which<pb n="2028" />is separated from Otene, a region of Armenia, by the riverAraxes; Gazæ<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> is its chief city, distant from Artaxata fourhundred and fifty miles, and the same from Ecbatana in Media,to which country Atropatene belongs.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">35 See c. 10.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He alludes to the town of Arbela, where, as it is generally said, thearmy of Darius was defeated by Alexander the Great; by which engage-ment the conflict was terminated.
