CRAT®GUM.</head><p>Many trees bears more than one production, a fact whichwe have already mentioned<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> when speaking of the glandiferous trees. In the number of these there is the laurel,which bears its own peculiar kind of grape, and more particularly the barren laurel,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> which bears nothing else; forwhich reason it is looked upon by some persons as the maletree. The filbert, too, bears catkins, which are hard and compact, but of no use<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> whatever.</p><p>(30.) But it is the box-tree that supplies us with the greatest number of products, not only its seed, but a berry also,known by the name of crat¾gum;<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> while on the north side<pb n="3391" />it produces mistletoe, and on the south hyphear; two products of which I shall shortly have to speak more<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> at length.Sometimes, indeed, this tree has all four of these productsgrowing upon it at the same moment.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In cc. 9Ð14 of the present Book.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This passage is quite unintelligible; and it is with good reason thatFŽe questions whether Pliny really understood the author that he copiedfrom.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">FŽe remarks, that Pliny does not seem to know that the catkin is anassemblage of flowers, and that without it the tree would be totally barren.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny blunders sadly here, in copying from Theophrastus, B. iii. c. 16.He mixes up a description of the box and the crat¾gus, or holm-oak, makingthe latter to be a seed of the former: and he then attributes a mistletoe tothe box, which Theophrastus speaks of as growing on the crat¾gus.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See c. 93, where he enlarges on the varieties of the mistletoe.</p></body>
