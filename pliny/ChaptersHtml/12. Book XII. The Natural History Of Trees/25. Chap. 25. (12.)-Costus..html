The root is thatof the costus;<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> it has a burning taste in the mouth, and amost exquisite odour; in other respects, the branches are goodfor nothing. In the island of Patale,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> situate at the verymouth of the river Indus, there are two kinds of costus found,the black and the white; the last is considered the best. Theprice of it is five denarii per pound.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">According to most commentators, this is the Costus Arabicus of Linnæus. Dioscorides mentions three varieties of costus: the Arabian, whichis of the best quality, and is white and odoriferous; the Indian, which isblack and smooth; and the Syrian, which is of the colour of wax, dusky, andstrong smelling. Fée, however, doubts whether the modern costus is thesame thing as that of the ancients; for, as he says, although it has a sweetodour, it does not deserve the appellation of a "precious aromatic," whichwe find constantly given to it by the ancients.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. vi. c. 23.</p></body>
