(13.)—THE RAPE.</head><p>The Latin writers have only treated of this plant in a cursory manner, while those of Greece have considered it a littlemore attentively; though even they have ranked it among thegarden plants. If, however, a methodical arrangement is tobe strictly observed, it should be spoken of immediately aftercorn, or the bean, at all events; for next to these two produc-tions, there is no plant that is of more extensive use. For, inthe first place, all animals will feed upon it as it grows; andit is far from being the least nutritious plant in the fields forvarious kinds of birds, when boiled in water more particularly.Cattle, too, are remarkably fond of the leaves of rape; andthe stalks and leaves, when in season, are no less esteemedas a food for man than the sprouts of the cabbage;<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> these,too, when turned yellow and left to die in the barn, are evenmore highly esteemed than<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> when green. As to the rapeitself, it will keep all the better if left in its mould, aftær whichit should be dried in the open air till the next crop is nearlyripe, as a resource in case of scarcity. Next to those of the<pb n="4048" />grape and corn, this is the most profitable harvest of all for thecountries that lie beyond the Padus. The rape is by no meansdifficult to please in soil, for it will grow almost anywhere,indeed where nothing else can be sown. It readily derivesnutriment from fogs and hoar-frosts, and grows to a marvellous size; I have seen them weighing upwards of forty pounds.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>It is prepared for table among us in several ways, and is madeto keep till the next crop, its Fermentation<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> being prevented bypreserving it in mustard. It is also tinted with no less thansix colours in addition to its own, and with purple even; in-deed, that which is used by us as food ought to bæ of no othercolour.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span></p><p>The Greeks have distinguished two principal species of rape,the male and the female,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> and have discovered a method of obtaining them both from the same seed; for when it is sown thick,or in a hard, cloggy soil, the produce will be male. The smallerthe seed the better it is in quality. There are three kinds ofrape in all; the first is broad and flat, the second of a sphericalshape, and tile third, to which the name of "wild" rape<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>has been given, throws out a long root, similar in appearanceto a radish, with an angular, rough leaf, and an acrid juice,which, if extracted about harvest, and mixed with a woman'smilk, is good for cleansing the eves and improving defectivesight. The colder the weather the sweeter they are, and thelarger, it is generally thought; heat makes them run to leaf.The finest rape of all is that grown in the district of Nurslia:it is valued at as much as one sesterce<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> per pound, and, intimes of scarcity, two even. That of the next best quality isproduced on Mount Algidus.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Napo-brassica of Linnæus.
