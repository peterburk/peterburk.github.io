<div2 type="chapter" n="81" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 81. (55.)—THE DIFFERENT SPECIES OF HARES.</head><p>There are also numerous species of hares. Those in theAlps are white,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and it is believed that, during the winter,they live upon snow for food; at all events, every year, as thesnow melts, they acquire a reddish colour; it is, moreover, ananimal which is capable of existing in the most severe climates.There is also a species of hare, in Spain, which is called the<pb n="2349" />rabbit;<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> it is extremely prolific, and produces famine in theBalearic islands, by destroying the harvests. The young ones,either when cut from out of the body of the mother, or takenfrom the breast, without having the entrails removed, are considered a most delicate food; they are then called laurices.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>It is a well-known fact, that the inhabitants of the Balearicislands begged of the late Emperor Augustus the aid of anumber of soldiers, to prevent the too rapid increase of theseanimals. The ferret<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> is greatly esteemed for its skill incatching them. It is thrown into the burrows, with theirnumerous outlets, which the rabbits form, and from which circumstance they derive their name,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> and as it drives them out,they are taken above. Archelaus informs us, that in the hare,the number of cavernous receptacles in the body for the excrements always equals that of its years;<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> but still the numbersare sometimes found to differ. He says also, that the same individual possesses the characteristics of the two sexes, and thatit becomes pregnant just as well without the aid of the male.It is a kind provision of Nature, in making animals which areboth harmless and good for food, thus prolific. The hare, whichis preyed upon by all other animals, is the only one, exceptthe dasypus,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> which is capable of superfœtation;<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> while themother is suckling one of her young, she has another in thewomb covered with hair, another without any covering at all,and another which is just beginning to be formed. Attempts<pb n="2350" />have been made to form a kind of stuff of the hair of theseanimals; but it is not so soft as when attached to the skin,and, in consequence of the shortness of the hairs, soon falls topieces.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hardouin gives references to the authors who have observed thischange in the colour of the hare, apparently depending upon the peculiarlocality, and its consequent exposure to a low temperature. Cuvier considersit as characteristic of a peculiar species, the Lepus variabilis, "which beingpeculiar to the highest mountains, and the regions of the north, is white inwinter."—B.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or coney, "cuniculus." Hardouin makes some observations uponthe derivation of this term, to show that Pliny was mistaken in supposingit to be of Spanish origin; we have also an observation of Cuvier's to thesame effect.—B.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Laurices;" we have no explanation of this word in any of theeditions of Pliny. Its origin appears to be quite unknown.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">According to Cuvier, the Mustela furo of Linæus. Ajasson, <hi rend="ital">ubi</hi><hi rend="ital">supra.—B.</hi></p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Because, as Varro says, De Re Rus. B. iii. c. 12, they are in the habitof making burrows—cuniculos—in the earth.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This reference to the opinion of Archelaus appears to be from Varro,<hi rend="ital">ubi supra;</hi> the same reference is made by Ælian, Hist. Anim. B. ii. c. 2.—B.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Respecting the dasypus of Pliny, it has been doubted whether it be adistinct species, a variety of the hare, or merely a synonyme.—B.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is by some contended, that the human female, and perhaps someother animals, have occasionally been the subjects of what is termed superfœtation; whereas, according to Pliny, in the hare and the dasypus it takesplace frequently, but in no other animals.—B. On this subject, see B. vii.c. 9.</p></body>
