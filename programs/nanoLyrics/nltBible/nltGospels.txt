NLT/Matthew 1	[The Ancestors of Jesus the Messiah] 1 This is a record of the ancestors of Jesus the Messiah, a descendant of David and of Abraham*:§2 Abraham was the father of Isaac. Isaac was the father of Jacob. Jacob was the father of Judah and his brothers.§3 Judah was the father of Perez and Zerah (whose mother was Tamar). Perez was the father of Hezron. Hezron was the father of Ram.*Ram was the father of Amminadab. Amminadab was the father of Nahshon. Nahshon was the father of Salmon.§5 Salmon was the father of Boaz (whose mother was Rahab). Boaz was the father of Obed (whose mother was Ruth). Obed was the father of Jesse.§6 Jesse was the father of King David. David was the father of Solomon (whose mother was Bathsheba, the widow of Uriah).§7 Solomon was the father of Rehoboam. Rehoboam was the father of Abijah. Abijah was the father of Asa.*Asa was the father of Jehoshaphat. Jehoshaphat was the father of Jehoram.*Jehoram was the father* of Uzziah.§9 Uzziah was the father of Jotham. Jotham was the father of Ahaz. Ahaz was the father of Hezekiah.§10 Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh. Manasseh was the father of Amon.*Amon was the father of Josiah.§11 Josiah was the father of Jehoiachin* and his brothers (born at the time of the exile to Babylon).§12 After the Babylonian exile: Jehoiachin was the father of Shealtiel. Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel.§13 Zerubbabel was the father of Abiud. Abiud was the father of Eliakim. Eliakim was the father of Azor.§14 Azor was the father of Zadok. Zadok was the father of Akim. Akim was the father of Eliud.§15 Eliud was the father of Eleazar. Eleazar was the father of Matthan. Matthan was the father of Jacob.§16 Jacob was the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary. Mary gave birth to Jesus, who is called the Messiah.§17 All those listed above include fourteen generations from Abraham to David, fourteen from David to the Babylonian exile, and fourteen from the Babylonian exile to the Messiah. §[The Birth of Jesus the Messiah] 18 This is how Jesus the Messiah was born. His mother, Mary, was engaged to be married to Joseph. But before the marriage took place, while she was still a virgin, she became pregnant through the power of the Holy Spirit. §19 Joseph, to whom she was engaged, was a righteous man and did not want to disgrace her publicly, so he decided to break the engagement* quietly.§20 As he considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream. "Joseph, son of David," the angel said, "do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife. For the child within her was conceived by the Holy Spirit. §21 And she will have a son, and you are to name him Jesus,* for he will save his people from their sins."§22 All of this occurred to fulfill the Lord's message through his prophet:§23 "Look! The virgin will conceive a child! She will give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel,*which means "God is with us.'"§24 When Joseph woke up, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded and took Mary as his wife. §25 But he did not have sexual relations with her until her son was born. And Joseph named him Jesus.       §§Footnotes:§ 1:1 Greek Jesus the Messiah, Son of David and son of Abraham.  § 1:3 Greek Aram, a variant spelling of Ram; also in 1:4.

NLT/Matthew 10	[Jesus Sends Out the Twelve Apostles] 1 Jesus called his twelve disciples together and gave them authority to cast out evil* spirits and to heal every kind of disease and illness. §2 Here are the names of the twelve apostles: first, Simon (also called Peter), then Andrew (Peter's brother), James (son of Zebedee), John (James's brother),§3 Philip, Bartholomew, Thomas, Matthew (the tax collector), James (son of Alphaeus), Thaddaeus,*Simon (the zealot*), Judas Iscariot (who later betrayed him).§5 Jesus sent out the twelve apostles with these instructions: "Don't go to the Gentiles or the Samaritans,  §6 but only to the people of Israel-God's lost sheep.  §7 Go and announce to them that the Kingdom of Heaven is near.* §8 Heal the sick, raise the dead, cure those with leprosy, and cast out demons. Give as freely as you have received! 9 "Don't take any money in your money belts-no gold, silver, or even copper coins.  §10 Don't carry a traveler's bag with a change of clothes and sandals or even a walking stick. Don't hesitate to accept hospitality, because those who work deserve to be fed. 11 "Whenever you enter a city or village, search for a worthy person and stay in his home until you leave town.  §12 When you enter the home, give it your blessing.  §13 If it turns out to be a worthy home, let your blessing stand; if it is not, take back the blessing.  §14 If any household or town refuses to welcome you or listen to your message, shake its dust from your feet as you leave.  §15 I tell you the truth, the wicked cities of Sodom and Gomorrah will be better off than such a town on the judgment day. 16 "Look, I am sending you out as sheep among wolves. So be as shrewd as snakes and harmless as doves.  §17 But beware! For you will be handed over to the courts and will be flogged with whips in the synagogues.  §18 You will stand trial before governors and kings because you are my followers. But this will be your opportunity to tell the rulers and other unbelievers about me.* §19 When you are arrested, don't worry about how to respond or what to say. God will give you the right words at the right time.  §20 For it is not you who will be speaking-it will be the Spirit of your Father speaking through you. 21 "A brother will betray his brother to death, a father will betray his own child, and children will rebel against their parents and cause them to be killed.  §22 And all nations will hate you because you are my followers.* But everyone who endures to the end will be saved.  §23 When you are persecuted in one town, flee to the next. I tell you the truth, the Son of Man* will return before you have reached all the towns of Israel. 24 "Students* are not greater than their teacher, and slaves are not greater than their master.  §25 Students are to be like their teacher, and slaves are to be like their master. And since I, the master of the household, have been called the prince of demons,* the members of my household will be called by even worse names! 26 "But don't be afraid of those who threaten you. For the time is coming when everything that is covered will be revealed, and all that is secret will be made known to all.  §27 What I tell you now in the darkness, shout abroad when daybreak comes. What I whisper in your ear, shout from the housetops for all to hear! 28 "Don't be afraid of those who want to kill your body; they cannot touch your soul. Fear only God, who can destroy both soul and body in hell.* §29 What is the price of two sparrows-one copper coin*? But not a single sparrow can fall to the ground without your Father knowing it.  §30 And the very hairs on your head are all numbered.  §31 So don't be afraid; you are more valuable to God than a whole flock of sparrows. 32 "Everyone who acknowledges me publicly here on earth, I will also acknowledge before my Father in heaven.  §33 But everyone who denies me here on earth, I will also deny before my Father in heaven. 34 "Don't imagine that I came to bring peace to the earth! I came not to bring peace, but a sword. 35 "I have come to set a man against his father,  a daughter against her mother,  and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. 36 Your enemies will be right in your own household!'*"If you love your father or mother more than you love me, you are not worthy of being mine; or if you love your son or daughter more than me, you are not worthy of being mine.  §38 If you refuse to take up your cross and follow me, you are not worthy of being mine.  §39 If you cling to your life, you will lose it; but if you give up your life for me, you will find it. 40 "Anyone who receives you receives me, and anyone who receives me receives the Father who sent me.  §41 If you receive a prophet as one who speaks for God,* you will be given the same reward as a prophet. And if you receive righteous people because of their righteousness, you will be given a reward like theirs.  §42 And if you give even a cup of cold water to one of the least of my followers, you will surely be rewarded."        §§Footnotes:§ 10:1 Greek unclean.  § 10:3 Other manuscripts read Lebbaeus; still others read Lebbaeus who is called Thaddaeus. 4 § 10:4 Greek the Cananean, an Aramaic term for Jewish nationalists.  § 10:7 Or has come, or is coming soon.  § 10:18 Or But this will be your testimony against the rulers and other unbelievers.  § 10:22 Greek on account of my name.  § 10:23 "Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself.  § 10:24 Or Disciples.  § 10:25 Greek Beelzeboul; other manuscripts read Beezeboul; Latin version reads Beelzebub.  § 10:28 Greek Gehenna.  § 10:29 Greek one assarion [i.e., one "as," a Roman coin equal to 1 16 of a denarius].  § 10:35-36 Mic 7:6.  37 § 10:41 Greek receive a prophet in the name of a prophet.  §
NLT/Matthew 11	[Jesus and John the Baptist] 1 When Jesus had finished giving these instructions to his twelve disciples, he went out to teach and preach in towns throughout the region.§2 John the Baptist, who was in prison, heard about all the things the Messiah was doing. So he sent his disciples to ask Jesus, §3 "Are you the Messiah we've been expecting,* or should we keep looking for someone else?"§4 Jesus told them, "Go back to John and tell him what you have heard and seen- 5 the blind see, the lame walk, those with leprosy are cured, the deaf hear, the dead are raised to life, and the Good News is being preached to the poor."  §6 And he added, "God blesses those who do not fall away because of me.*" 7 As John's disciples were leaving, Jesus began talking about him to the crowds. "What kind of man did you go into the wilderness to see? Was he a weak reed, swayed by every breath of wind?  §8 Or were you expecting to see a man dressed in expensive clothes? No, people with expensive clothes live in palaces.  §9 Were you looking for a prophet? Yes, and he is more than a prophet.  §10 John is the man to whom the Scriptures refer when they say,  "Look, I am sending my messenger ahead of you,  and he will prepare your way before you.'*"I tell you the truth, of all who have ever lived, none is greater than John the Baptist. Yet even the least person in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he is!  §12 And from the time John the Baptist began preaching until now, the Kingdom of Heaven has been forcefully advancing,* and violent people are attacking it.  §13 For before John came, all the prophets and the law of Moses looked forward to this present time.  §14 And if you are willing to accept what I say, he is Elijah, the one the prophets said would come.* §15 Anyone with ears to hear should listen and understand! 16 "To what can I compare this generation? It is like children playing a game in the public square. They complain to their friends, 17 "We played wedding songs,  and you didn't dance,  so we played funeral songs,  and you didn't mourn.' 18 For John didn't spend his time eating and drinking, and you say, "He's possessed by a demon.'  §19 The Son of Man,* on the other hand, feasts and drinks, and you say, "He's a glutton and a drunkard, and a friend of tax collectors and other sinners!' But wisdom is shown to be right by its results."  §[Judgment for the Unbelievers] 20 Then Jesus began to denounce the towns where he had done so many of his miracles, because they hadn't repented of their sins and turned to God. §21 "What sorrow awaits you, Korazin and Bethsaida! For if the miracles I did in you had been done in wicked Tyre and Sidon, their people would have repented of their sins long ago, clothing themselves in burlap and throwing ashes on their heads to show their remorse.  §22 I tell you, Tyre and Sidon will be better off on judgment day than you. 23 "And you people of Capernaum, will you be honored in heaven? No, you will go down to the place of the dead.* For if the miracles I did for you had been done in wicked Sodom, it would still be here today.  §24 I tell you, even Sodom will be better off on judgment day than you."  §[Jesus' Prayer of Thanksgiving] 25 At that time Jesus prayed this prayer: "O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, thank you for hiding these things from those who think themselves wise and clever, and for revealing them to the childlike.  §26 Yes, Father, it pleased you to do it this way! 27 "My Father has entrusted everything to me. No one truly knows the Son except the Father, and no one truly knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him." 28 Then Jesus said, "Come to me, all of you who are weary and carry heavy burdens, and I will give you rest.  §29 Take my yoke upon you. Let me teach you, because I am humble and gentle at heart, and you will find rest for your souls.  §30 For my yoke is easy to bear, and the burden I give you is light."        §§Footnotes:§ 11:3 Greek Are you the one who is coming?  § 11:6 Or who are not offended by me.  § 11:10 Mal 3:1.  11 § 11:12 Or the Kingdom of Heaven has suffered from violence.  § 11:14 See Mal 4:5.  § 11:19 "Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself.  § 11:23 Greek to Hades.  §
NLT/Matthew 12	[A Discussion about the Sabbath] 1 At about that time Jesus was walking through some grainfields on the Sabbath. His disciples were hungry, so they began breaking off some heads of grain and eating them. §2 But some Pharisees saw them do it and protested, "Look, your disciples are breaking the law by harvesting grain on the Sabbath."§3 Jesus said to them, "Haven't you read in the Scriptures what David did when he and his companions were hungry?  §4 He went into the house of God, and he and his companions broke the law by eating the sacred loaves of bread that only the priests are allowed to eat.  §5 And haven't you read in the law of Moses that the priests on duty in the Temple may work on the Sabbath?  §6 I tell you, there is one here who is even greater than the Temple!  §7 But you would not have condemned my innocent disciples if you knew the meaning of this Scripture: "I want you to show mercy, not offer sacrifices.'* §8 For the Son of Man* is Lord, even over the Sabbath!"  §[Jesus Heals on the Sabbath] 9 Then Jesus went over to their synagogue, §10 where he noticed a man with a deformed hand. The Pharisees asked Jesus, "Does the law permit a person to work by healing on the Sabbath?" (They were hoping he would say yes, so they could bring charges against him.)§11 And he answered, "If you had a sheep that fell into a well on the Sabbath, wouldn't you work to pull it out? Of course you would.  §12 And how much more valuable is a person than a sheep! Yes, the law permits a person to do good on the Sabbath." 13 Then he said to the man, "Hold out your hand."  So the man held out his hand, and it was restored, just like the other one! §14 Then the Pharisees called a meeting to plot how to kill Jesus. §[Jesus, God's Chosen Servant] 15 But Jesus knew what they were planning. So he left that area, and many people followed him. He healed all the sick among them, §16 but he warned them not to reveal who he was. §17 This fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah concerning him:§18 "Look at my Servant, whom I have chosen. He is my Beloved, who pleases me. I will put my Spirit upon him, and he will proclaim justice to the nations.§19 He will not fight or shout or raise his voice in public.§20 He will not crush the weakest reed or put out a flickering candle. Finally he will cause justice to be victorious.§21 And his name will be the hope of all the world."*Then a demon-possessed man, who was blind and couldn't speak, was brought to Jesus. He healed the man so that he could both speak and see. §23 The crowd was amazed and asked, "Could it be that Jesus is the Son of David, the Messiah?"§24 But when the Pharisees heard about the miracle, they said, "No wonder he can cast out demons. He gets his power from Satan,* the prince of demons."§25 Jesus knew their thoughts and replied, "Any kingdom divided by civil war is doomed. A town or family splintered by feuding will fall apart.  §26 And if Satan is casting out Satan, he is divided and fighting against himself. His own kingdom will not survive.  §27 And if I am empowered by Satan, what about your own exorcists? They cast out demons, too, so they will condemn you for what you have said.  §28 But if I am casting out demons by the Spirit of God, then the Kingdom of God has arrived among you.  §29 For who is powerful enough to enter the house of a strong man and plunder his goods? Only someone even stronger-someone who could tie him up and then plunder his house. 30 "Anyone who isn't with me opposes me, and anyone who isn't working with me is actually working against me. 31 "So I tell you, every sin and blasphemy can be forgiven-except blasphemy against the Holy Spirit, which will never be forgiven.  §32 Anyone who speaks against the Son of Man can be forgiven, but anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven, either in this world or in the world to come. 33 "A tree is identified by its fruit. If a tree is good, its fruit will be good. If a tree is bad, its fruit will be bad.  §34 You brood of snakes! How could evil men like you speak what is good and right? For whatever is in your heart determines what you say.  §35 A good person produces good things from the treasury of a good heart, and an evil person produces evil things from the treasury of an evil heart.  §36 And I tell you this, you must give an account on judgment day for every idle word you speak.  §37 The words you say will either acquit you or condemn you."  §[The Sign of Jonah] 38 One day some teachers of religious law and Pharisees came to Jesus and said, "Teacher, we want you to show us a miraculous sign to prove your authority."§39 But Jesus replied, "Only an evil, adulterous generation would demand a miraculous sign; but the only sign I will give them is the sign of the prophet Jonah.  §40 For as Jonah was in the belly of the great fish for three days and three nights, so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights. 41 "The people of Nineveh will stand up against this generation on judgment day and condemn it, for they repented of their sins at the preaching of Jonah. Now someone greater than Jonah is here-but you refuse to repent.  §42 The queen of Sheba* will also stand up against this generation on judgment day and condemn it, for she came from a distant land to hear the wisdom of Solomon. Now someone greater than Solomon is here-but you refuse to listen. 43 "When an evil* spirit leaves a person, it goes into the desert, seeking rest but finding none.  §44 Then it says, "I will return to the person I came from.' So it returns and finds its former home empty, swept, and in order.  §45 Then the spirit finds seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they all enter the person and live there. And so that person is worse off than before. That will be the experience of this evil generation."  §[The True Family of Jesus] 46 As Jesus was speaking to the crowd, his mother and brothers stood outside, asking to speak to him. §47 Someone told Jesus, "Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, and they want to speak to you."*Jesus asked, "Who is my mother? Who are my brothers?"  §49 Then he pointed to his disciples and said, "Look, these are my mother and brothers.  §50 Anyone who does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother!"        §§Footnotes:§ 12:7 Hos 6:6 (Greek version).  § 12:8 "Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself.  § 12:18-21 Isa 42:1-4 (Greek version for 42:4).  §[Jesus and the Prince of Demons] 22 § 12:24 Greek Beelzeboul; also in 12:27.

NLT/Matthew 13	[Parable of the Farmer Scattering Seed] 1 Later that same day Jesus left the house and sat beside the lake. §2 A large crowd soon gathered around him, so he got into a boat. Then he sat there and taught as the people stood on the shore. §3 He told many stories in the form of parables, such as this one: "Listen! A farmer went out to plant some seeds.  §4 As he scattered them across his field, some seeds fell on a footpath, and the birds came and ate them.  §5 Other seeds fell on shallow soil with underlying rock. The seeds sprouted quickly because the soil was shallow.  §6 But the plants soon wilted under the hot sun, and since they didn't have deep roots, they died.  §7 Other seeds fell among thorns that grew up and choked out the tender plants.  §8 Still other seeds fell on fertile soil, and they produced a crop that was thirty, sixty, and even a hundred times as much as had been planted!  §9 Anyone with ears to hear should listen and understand." §10 His disciples came and asked him, "Why do you use parables when you talk to the people?"§11 He replied, "You are permitted to understand the secrets* of the Kingdom of Heaven, but others are not.  §12 To those who listen to my teaching, more understanding will be given, and they will have an abundance of knowledge. But for those who are not listening, even what little understanding they have will be taken away from them.  §13 That is why I use these parables,  For they look, but they don't really see.  They hear, but they don't really listen or understand. §14 This fulfills the prophecy of Isaiah that says,  "When you hear what I say,  you will not understand.  When you see what I do,  you will not comprehend. §15 For the hearts of these people are hardened,  and their ears cannot hear,  and they have closed their eyes-  so their eyes cannot see,  and their ears cannot hear,  and their hearts cannot understand,  and they cannot turn to me  and let me heal them.'*§16 "But blessed are your eyes, because they see; and your ears, because they hear.  §17 I tell you the truth, many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see, but they didn't see it. And they longed to hear what you hear, but they didn't hear it. §18 "Now listen to the explanation of the parable about the farmer planting seeds:  §19 The seed that fell on the footpath represents those who hear the message about the Kingdom and don't understand it. Then the evil one comes and snatches away the seed that was planted in their hearts.  §20 The seed on the rocky soil represents those who hear the message and immediately receive it with joy.  §21 But since they don't have deep roots, they don't last long. They fall away as soon as they have problems or are persecuted for believing God's word.  §22 The seed that fell among the thorns represents those who hear God's word, but all too quickly the message is crowded out by the worries of this life and the lure of wealth, so no fruit is produced.  §23 The seed that fell on good soil represents those who truly hear and understand God's word and produce a harvest of thirty, sixty, or even a hundred times as much as had been planted!"  §[Parable of the Wheat and Weeds] 24 Here is another story Jesus told: "The Kingdom of Heaven is like a farmer who planted good seed in his field.  §25 But that night as the workers slept, his enemy came and planted weeds among the wheat, then slipped away.  §26 When the crop began to grow and produce grain, the weeds also grew. §27 "The farmer's workers went to him and said, "Sir, the field where you planted that good seed is full of weeds! Where did they come from?' §28 ""An enemy has done this!' the farmer exclaimed.  ""Should we pull out the weeds?' they asked. §29 ""No,' he replied, "you'll uproot the wheat if you do.  §30 Let both grow together until the harvest. Then I will tell the harvesters to sort out the weeds, tie them into bundles, and burn them, and to put the wheat in the barn.'"  §[Parable of the Mustard Seed] 31 Here is another illustration Jesus used: "The Kingdom of Heaven is like a mustard seed planted in a field.  §32 It is the smallest of all seeds, but it becomes the largest of garden plants; it grows into a tree, and birds come and make nests in its branches."  §[Parable of the Yeast] 33 Jesus also used this illustration: "The Kingdom of Heaven is like the yeast a woman used in making bread. Even though she put only a little yeast in three measures of flour, it permeated every part of the dough." §34 Jesus always used stories and illustrations like these when speaking to the crowds. In fact, he never spoke to them without using such parables. §35 This fulfilled what God had spoken through the prophet: "I will speak to you in parables. I will explain things hidden since the creation of the world.*" §[Parable of the Wheat and Weeds Explained] 36 Then, leaving the crowds outside, Jesus went into the house. His disciples said, "Please explain to us the story of the weeds in the field."§37 Jesus replied, "The Son of Man* is the farmer who plants the good seed.  §38 The field is the world, and the good seed represents the people of the Kingdom. The weeds are the people who belong to the evil one.  §39 The enemy who planted the weeds among the wheat is the devil. The harvest is the end of the world,* and the harvesters are the angels. §40 "Just as the weeds are sorted out and burned in the fire, so it will be at the end of the world.  §41 The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will remove from his Kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil.  §42 And the angels will throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  §43 Then the righteous will shine like the sun in their Father's Kingdom. Anyone with ears to hear should listen and understand!  §[Parables of the Hidden Treasure and the Pearl] 44 "The Kingdom of Heaven is like a treasure that a man discovered hidden in a field. In his excitement, he hid it again and sold everything he owned to get enough money to buy the field. §45 "Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a merchant on the lookout for choice pearls.  §46 When he discovered a pearl of great value, he sold everything he owned and bought it!  §[Parable of the Fishing Net] 47 "Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a fishing net that was thrown into the water and caught fish of every kind.  §48 When the net was full, they dragged it up onto the shore, sat down, and sorted the good fish into crates, but threw the bad ones away.  §49 That is the way it will be at the end of the world. The angels will come and separate the wicked people from the righteous,  §50 throwing the wicked into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  §51 Do you understand all these things?"  "Yes," they said, "we do."§52 Then he added, "Every teacher of religious law who becomes a disciple in the Kingdom of Heaven is like a homeowner who brings from his storeroom new gems of truth as well as old."  §[Jesus Rejected at Nazareth] 53 When Jesus had finished telling these stories and illustrations, he left that part of the country. §54 He returned to Nazareth, his hometown. When he taught there in the synagogue, everyone was amazed and said, "Where does he get this wisdom and the power to do miracles?" §55 Then they scoffed, "He's just the carpenter's son, and we know Mary, his mother, and his brothers-James, Joseph,* Simon, and Judas. §56 All his sisters live right here among us. Where did he learn all these things?" §57 And they were deeply offended and refused to believe in him. Then Jesus told them, "A prophet is honored everywhere except in his own hometown and among his own family."  §58 And so he did only a few miracles there because of their unbelief.       §§Footnotes:§ 13:11 Greek the mysteries.  § 13:14-15 Isa 6:9-10 (Greek version).  x§ 13:35 Some manuscripts do not include of the world.

NLT/Matthew 14	[The Death of John the Baptist] 1 When Herod Antipas, the ruler of Galilee,* heard about Jesus, §2 he said to his advisers, "This must be John the Baptist raised from the dead! That is why he can do such miracles."§3 For Herod had arrested and imprisoned John as a favor to his wife Herodias (the former wife of Herod's brother Philip). §4 John had been telling Herod, "It is against God's law for you to marry her." §5 Herod wanted to kill John, but he was afraid of a riot, because all the people believed John was a prophet.§6 But at a birthday party for Herod, Herodias's daughter performed a dance that greatly pleased him, §7 so he promised with a vow to give her anything she wanted. §8 At her mother's urging, the girl said, "I want the head of John the Baptist on a tray!" §9 Then the king regretted what he had said; but because of the vow he had made in front of his guests, he issued the necessary orders. §10 So John was beheaded in the prison, §11 and his head was brought on a tray and given to the girl, who took it to her mother. §12 Later, John's disciples came for his body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus what had happened. §[Jesus Feeds Five Thousand] 13 As soon as Jesus heard the news, he left in a boat to a remote area to be alone. But the crowds heard where he was headed and followed on foot from many towns. §14 Jesus saw the huge crowd as he stepped from the boat, and he had compassion on them and healed their sick.§15 That evening the disciples came to him and said, "This is a remote place, and it's already getting late. Send the crowds away so they can go to the villages and buy food for themselves."§16 But Jesus said, "That isn't necessary-you feed them." 17 "But we have only five loaves of bread and two fish!" they answered.§18 "Bring them here,"  he said. §19 Then he told the people to sit down on the grass. Jesus took the five loaves and two fish, looked up toward heaven, and blessed them. Then, breaking the loaves into pieces, he gave the bread to the disciples, who distributed it to the people. §20 They all ate as much as they wanted, and afterward, the disciples picked up twelve baskets of leftovers. §21 About 5,000 men were fed that day, in addition to all the women and children! §[Jesus Walks on Water] 22 Immediately after this, Jesus insisted that his disciples get back into the boat and cross to the other side of the lake, while he sent the people home. §23 After sending them home, he went up into the hills by himself to pray. Night fell while he was there alone.§24 Meanwhile, the disciples were in trouble far away from land, for a strong wind had risen, and they were fighting heavy waves. §25 About three o'clock in the morning* Jesus came toward them, walking on the water. §26 When the disciples saw him walking on the water, they were terrified. In their fear, they cried out, "It's a ghost!"§27 But Jesus spoke to them at once. "Don't be afraid,"  he said. "Take courage. I am here!*" 28 Then Peter called to him, "Lord, if it's really you, tell me to come to you, walking on the water."§29 "Yes, come,"  Jesus said. So Peter went over the side of the boat and walked on the water toward Jesus. §30 But when he saw the strong* wind and the waves, he was terrified and began to sink. "Save me, Lord!" he shouted.§31 Jesus immediately reached out and grabbed him. "You have so little faith,"  Jesus said. "Why did you doubt me?" 32 When they climbed back into the boat, the wind stopped. §33 Then the disciples worshiped him. "You really are the Son of God!" they exclaimed.§34 After they had crossed the lake, they landed at Gennesaret. §35 When the people recognized Jesus, the news of his arrival spread quickly throughout the whole area, and soon people were bringing all their sick to be healed. §36 They begged him to let the sick touch at least the fringe of his robe, and all who touched him were healed.       §§Footnotes:§ 14:1 Greek Herod the tetrarch.

NLT/Matthew 15	[Jesus Teaches about Inner Purity] 1 Some Pharisees and teachers of religious law now arrived from Jerusalem to see Jesus. They asked him, §2 "Why do your disciples disobey our age-old tradition? For they ignore our tradition of ceremonial hand washing before they eat."§3 Jesus replied, "And why do you, by your traditions, violate the direct commandments of God?  §4 For instance, God says, "Honor your father and mother,'* and "Anyone who speaks disrespectfully of father or mother must be put to death.'* §5 But you say it is all right for people to say to their parents, "Sorry, I can't help you. For I have vowed to give to God what I would have given to you.'  §6 In this way, you say they don't need to honor their parents.* And so you cancel the word of God for the sake of your own tradition.  §7 You hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you, for he wrote, 8 "These people honor me with their lips,  but their hearts are far from me. 9 Their worship is a farce,  for they teach man-made ideas as commands from God.'*" 10 Then Jesus called to the crowd to come and hear. "Listen,"  he said, "and try to understand.  §11 It's not what goes into your mouth that defiles you; you are defiled by the words that come out of your mouth." 12 Then the disciples came to him and asked, "Do you realize you offended the Pharisees by what you just said?"§13 Jesus replied, "Every plant not planted by my heavenly Father will be uprooted,  §14 so ignore them. They are blind guides leading the blind, and if one blind person guides another, they will both fall into a ditch." 15 Then Peter said to Jesus, "Explain to us the parable that says people aren't defiled by what they eat."§16 "Don't you understand yet?"  Jesus asked. §17 "Anything you eat passes through the stomach and then goes into the sewer.  §18 But the words you speak come from the heart-that's what defiles you.  §19 For from the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, all sexual immorality, theft, lying, and slander.  §20 These are what defile you. Eating with unwashed hands will never defile you."  §[The Faith of a Gentile Woman] 21 Then Jesus left Galilee and went north to the region of Tyre and Sidon. §22 A Gentile* woman who lived there came to him, pleading, "Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David! For my daughter is possessed by a demon that torments her severely."§23 But Jesus gave her no reply, not even a word. Then his disciples urged him to send her away. "Tell her to go away," they said. "She is bothering us with all her begging."§24 Then Jesus said to the woman, "I was sent only to help God's lost sheep-the people of Israel." 25 But she came and worshiped him, pleading again, "Lord, help me!"§26 Jesus responded, "It isn't right to take food from the children and throw it to the dogs." 27 She replied, "That's true, Lord, but even dogs are allowed to eat the scraps that fall beneath their masters' table."§28 "Dear woman,"  Jesus said to her, "your faith is great. Your request is granted."  And her daughter was instantly healed. §[Jesus Heals Many People] 29 Jesus returned to the Sea of Galilee and climbed a hill and sat down. §30 A vast crowd brought to him people who were lame, blind, crippled, those who couldn't speak, and many others. They laid them before Jesus, and he healed them all. §31 The crowd was amazed! Those who hadn't been able to speak were talking, the crippled were made well, the lame were walking, and the blind could see again! And they praised the God of Israel. §[Jesus Feeds Four Thousand] 32 Then Jesus called his disciples and told them, "I feel sorry for these people. They have been here with me for three days, and they have nothing left to eat. I don't want to send them away hungry, or they will faint along the way." 33 The disciples replied, "Where would we get enough food here in the wilderness for such a huge crowd?"§34 Jesus asked, "How much bread do you have?"  They replied, "Seven loaves, and a few small fish."§35 So Jesus told all the people to sit down on the ground. §36 Then he took the seven loaves and the fish, thanked God for them, and broke them into pieces. He gave them to the disciples, who distributed the food to the crowd.§37 They all ate as much as they wanted. Afterward, the disciples picked up seven large baskets of leftover food. §38 There were 4,000 men who were fed that day, in addition to all the women and children. §39 Then Jesus sent the people home, and he got into a boat and crossed over to the region of Magadan.       §§Footnotes:§ 15:4a Exod 20:12; Deut 5:16.  § 15:4b Exod 21:17 (Greek version); Lev 20:9 (Greek version).  § 15:6 Greek their father; other manuscripts read their father or their mother.  § 15:8-9 Isa 29:13 (Greek version).  § 15:22 Greek Canaanite.  §
NLT/Matthew 16	[Leaders Demand a Miraculous Sign] 1 One day the Pharisees and Sadducees came to test Jesus, demanding that he show them a miraculous sign from heaven to prove his authority.§2 He replied, "You know the saying, "Red sky at night means fair weather tomorrow;  §3 red sky in the morning means foul weather all day.' You know how to interpret the weather signs in the sky, but you don't know how to interpret the signs of the times!* §4 Only an evil, adulterous generation would demand a miraculous sign, but the only sign I will give them is the sign of the prophet Jonah.*"  Then Jesus left them and went away. §[Yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees] 5 Later, after they crossed to the other side of the lake, the disciples discovered they had forgotten to bring any bread. §6 "Watch out!"  Jesus warned them. "Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees." 7 At this they began to argue with each other because they hadn't brought any bread. §8 Jesus knew what they were saying, so he said, "You have so little faith! Why are you arguing with each other about having no bread?  §9 Don't you understand even yet? Don't you remember the 5,000 I fed with five loaves, and the baskets of leftovers you picked up?  §10 Or the 4,000 I fed with seven loaves, and the large baskets of leftovers you picked up?  §11 Why can't you understand that I'm not talking about bread? So again I say, "Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.'" 12 Then at last they understood that he wasn't speaking about the yeast in bread, but about the deceptive teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. §[Peter's Declaration about Jesus] 13 When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, "Who do people say that the Son of Man is?"*"Well," they replied, "some say John the Baptist, some say Elijah, and others say Jeremiah or one of the other prophets."§15 Then he asked them, "But who do you say I am?" 16 Simon Peter answered, "You are the Messiah,* the Son of the living God."§17 Jesus replied, "You are blessed, Simon son of John,* because my Father in heaven has revealed this to you. You did not learn this from any human being.  §18 Now I say to you that you are Peter (which means "rock'),* and upon this rock I will build my church, and all the powers of hell* will not conquer it.  §19 And I will give you the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven. Whatever you forbid* on earth will be forbidden in heaven, and whatever you permit* on earth will be permitted in heaven." 20 Then he sternly warned the disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah. §[Jesus Predicts His Death] 21 From then on Jesus* began to tell his disciples plainly that it was necessary for him to go to Jerusalem, and that he would suffer many terrible things at the hands of the elders, the leading priests, and the teachers of religious law. He would be killed, but on the third day he would be raised from the dead.§22 But Peter took him aside and began to reprimand him* for saying such things. "Heaven forbid, Lord," he said. "This will never happen to you!"§23 Jesus turned to Peter and said, "Get away from me, Satan! You are a dangerous trap to me. You are seeing things merely from a human point of view, not from God's." 24 Then Jesus said to his disciples, "If any of you wants to be my follower, you must give up your own way, take up your cross, and follow me.  §25 If you try to hang on to your life, you will lose it. But if you give up your life for my sake, you will save it.  §26 And what do you benefit if you gain the whole world but lose your own soul?* Is anything worth more than your soul?  §27 For the Son of Man will come with his angels in the glory of his Father and will judge all people according to their deeds.  §28 And I tell you the truth, some standing here right now will not die before they see the Son of Man coming in his Kingdom."        §§Footnotes:§ 16:2-3 Several manuscripts do not include any of the words in 16:2-3 after He replied.  § 16:4 Greek the sign of Jonah.  § 16:13 "Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself.  14 § 16:16 Or the Christ.

NLT/Matthew 17	[The Transfiguration] 1 Six days later Jesus took Peter and the two brothers, James and John, and led them up a high mountain to be alone. §2 As the men watched, Jesus' appearance was transformed so that his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as light. §3 Suddenly, Moses and Elijah appeared and began talking with Jesus.§4 Peter exclaimed, "Lord, it's wonderful for us to be here! If you want, I'll make three shelters as memorials*-one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."§5 But even as he spoke, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and a voice from the cloud said, "This is my dearly loved Son, who brings me great joy. Listen to him." §6 The disciples were terrified and fell face down on the ground.§7 Then Jesus came over and touched them. "Get up,"  he said. "Don't be afraid."  §8 And when they looked up, Moses and Elijah were gone, and they saw only Jesus.§9 As they went back down the mountain, Jesus commanded them, "Don't tell anyone what you have seen until the Son of Man* has been raised from the dead." 10 Then his disciples asked him, "Why do the teachers of religious law insist that Elijah must return before the Messiah comes?*"§11 Jesus replied, "Elijah is indeed coming first to get everything ready.  §12 But I tell you, Elijah has already come, but he wasn't recognized, and they chose to abuse him. And in the same way they will also make the Son of Man suffer."  §13 Then the disciples realized he was talking about John the Baptist. §[Jesus Heals a Demon-Possessed Boy] 14 At the foot of the mountain, a large crowd was waiting for them. A man came and knelt before Jesus and said, §15 "Lord, have mercy on my son. He has seizures and suffers terribly. He often falls into the fire or into the water. §16 So I brought him to your disciples, but they couldn't heal him."§17 Jesus said, "You faithless and corrupt people! How long must I be with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring the boy here to me."  §18 Then Jesus rebuked the demon in the boy, and it left him. From that moment the boy was well.§19 Afterward the disciples asked Jesus privately, "Why couldn't we cast out that demon?"§20 "You don't have enough faith,"  Jesus told them. "I tell you the truth, if you had faith even as small as a mustard seed, you could say to this mountain, "Move from here to there,' and it would move. Nothing would be impossible.*"  §[Jesus Again Predicts His Death] 22 After they gathered again in Galilee, Jesus told them, "The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of his enemies.  §23 He will be killed, but on the third day he will be raised from the dead."  And the disciples were filled with grief. §[Payment of the Temple Tax] 24 On their arrival in Capernaum, the collectors of the Temple tax* came to Peter and asked him, "Doesn't your teacher pay the Temple tax?"§25 "Yes, he does," Peter replied. Then he went into the house. But before he had a chance to speak, Jesus asked him, "What do you think, Peter?* Do kings tax their own people or the people they have conquered?*" 26 "They tax the people they have conquered," Peter replied. "Well, then,"  Jesus said, "the citizens are free!  §27 However, we don't want to offend them, so go down to the lake and throw in a line. Open the mouth of the first fish you catch, and you will find a large silver coin.* Take it and pay the tax for both of us."        §§Footnotes:§ 17:4 Greek three tabernacles.  § 17:9 "Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself.  § 17:10 Greek that Elijah must come first?  § 17:20 Some manuscripts add verse 21, But this kind of demon won't leave except by prayer and fasting.

NLT/Matthew 18	[The Greatest in the Kingdom] 1 About that time the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Who is greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven?"§2 Jesus called a little child to him and put the child among them. §3 Then he said, "I tell you the truth, unless you turn from your sins and become like little children, you will never get into the Kingdom of Heaven.  §4 So anyone who becomes as humble as this little child is the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven. 5 "And anyone who welcomes a little child like this on my behalf* is welcoming me.  §6 But if you cause one of these little ones who trusts in me to fall into sin, it would be better for you to have a large millstone tied around your neck and be drowned in the depths of the sea. 7 "What sorrow awaits the world, because it tempts people to sin. Temptations are inevitable, but what sorrow awaits the person who does the tempting.  §8 So if your hand or foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It's better to enter eternal life with only one hand or one foot than to be thrown into eternal fire with both of your hands and feet.  §9 And if your eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It's better to enter eternal life with only one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell.*"Beware that you don't look down on any of these little ones. For I tell you that in heaven their angels are always in the presence of my heavenly Father.*"If a man has a hundred sheep and one of them wanders away, what will he do? Won't he leave the ninety-nine others on the hills and go out to search for the one that is lost?  §13 And if he finds it, I tell you the truth, he will rejoice over it more than over the ninety-nine that didn't wander away!  §14 In the same way, it is not my heavenly Father's will that even one of these little ones should perish.  §[Correcting Another Believer] 15 "If another believer* sins against you,* go privately and point out the offense. If the other person listens and confesses it, you have won that person back.  §16 But if you are unsuccessful, take one or two others with you and go back again, so that everything you say may be confirmed by two or three witnesses.  §17 If the person still refuses to listen, take your case to the church. Then if he or she won't accept the church's decision, treat that person as a pagan or a corrupt tax collector. 18 "I tell you the truth, whatever you forbid* on earth will be forbidden in heaven, and whatever you permit* on earth will be permitted in heaven. 19 "I also tell you this: If two of you agree here on earth concerning anything you ask, my Father in heaven will do it for you.  §20 For where two or three gather together as my followers,* I am there among them."  §[Parable of the Unforgiving Debtor] 21 Then Peter came to him and asked, "Lord, how often should I forgive someone* who sins against me? Seven times?"§22 "No, not seven times,"  Jesus replied, "but seventy times seven!*"Therefore, the Kingdom of Heaven can be compared to a king who decided to bring his accounts up to date with servants who had borrowed money from him.  §24 In the process, one of his debtors was brought in who owed him millions of dollars.* §25 He couldn't pay, so his master ordered that he be sold-along with his wife, his children, and everything he owned-to pay the debt. 26 "But the man fell down before his master and begged him, "Please, be patient with me, and I will pay it all.'  §27 Then his master was filled with pity for him, and he released him and forgave his debt. 28 "But when the man left the king, he went to a fellow servant who owed him a few thousand dollars.* He grabbed him by the throat and demanded instant payment. 29 "His fellow servant fell down before him and begged for a little more time. "Be patient with me, and I will pay it,' he pleaded.  §30 But his creditor wouldn't wait. He had the man arrested and put in prison until the debt could be paid in full. 31 "When some of the other servants saw this, they were very upset. They went to the king and told him everything that had happened.  §32 Then the king called in the man he had forgiven and said, "You evil servant! I forgave you that tremendous debt because you pleaded with me.  §33 Shouldn't you have mercy on your fellow servant, just as I had mercy on you?'  §34 Then the angry king sent the man to prison to be tortured until he had paid his entire debt. §35 "That's what my heavenly Father will do to you if you refuse to forgive your brothers and sisters* from your heart."        §§Footnotes:§ 18:5 Greek in my name.  § 18:9 Greek the Gehenna of fire.  10 § 18:10 Some manuscripts add verse 11, And the Son of Man came to save those who are lost.

NLT/Matthew 19	[Discussion about Divorce and Marriage] 1 When Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went down to the region of Judea east of the Jordan River. §2 Large crowds followed him there, and he healed their sick.§3 Some Pharisees came and tried to trap him with this question: "Should a man be allowed to divorce his wife for just any reason?"§4 "Haven't you read the Scriptures?"  Jesus replied. "They record that from the beginning "God made them male and female.'*"  §5 And he said, ""This explains why a man leaves his father and mother and is joined to his wife, and the two are united into one.'* §6 Since they are no longer two but one, let no one split apart what God has joined together." 7 "Then why did Moses say in the law that a man could give his wife a written notice of divorce and send her away?"* they asked.§8 Jesus replied, "Moses permitted divorce only as a concession to your hard hearts, but it was not what God had originally intended.  §9 And I tell you this, whoever divorces his wife and marries someone else commits adultery-unless his wife has been unfaithful.*" 10 Jesus' disciples then said to him, "If this is the case, it is better not to marry!"§11 "Not everyone can accept this statement,"  Jesus said. "Only those whom God helps.  §12 Some are born as eunuchs, some have been made eunuchs by others, and some choose not to marry* for the sake of the Kingdom of Heaven. Let anyone accept this who can."  §[Jesus Blesses the Children] 13 One day some parents brought their children to Jesus so he could lay his hands on them and pray for them. But the disciples scolded the parents for bothering him.§14 But Jesus said, "Let the children come to me. Don't stop them! For the Kingdom of Heaven belongs to those who are like these children."  §15 And he placed his hands on their heads and blessed them before he left. §[The Rich Man] 16 Someone came to Jesus with this question: "Teacher,* what good deed must I do to have eternal life?"§17 "Why ask me about what is good?"  Jesus replied. "There is only One who is good. But to answer your question-if you want to receive eternal life, keep* the commandments." 18 "Which ones?" the man asked. And Jesus replied: ""You must not murder. You must not commit adultery. You must not steal. You must not testify falsely.  §19 Honor your father and mother. Love your neighbor as yourself.'*" 20 "I've obeyed all these commandments," the young man replied. "What else must I do?"§21 Jesus told him, "If you want to be perfect, go and sell all your possessions and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me." 22 But when the young man heard this, he went away sad, for he had many possessions.§23 Then Jesus said to his disciples, "I tell you the truth, it is very hard for a rich person to enter the Kingdom of Heaven.  §24 I'll say it again-it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the Kingdom of God!" 25 The disciples were astounded. "Then who in the world can be saved?" they asked.§26 Jesus looked at them intently and said, "Humanly speaking, it is impossible. But with God everything is possible." 27 Then Peter said to him, "We've given up everything to follow you. What will we get?"§28 Jesus replied, "I assure you that when the world is made new* and the Son of Man* sits upon his glorious throne, you who have been my followers will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.  §29 And everyone who has given up houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or property, for my sake, will receive a hundred times as much in return and will inherit eternal life.  §30 But many who are the greatest now will be least important then, and those who seem least important now will be the greatest then.*§§Footnotes:§ 19:4 Gen 1:27; 5:2.  § 19:5 Gen 2:24.  § 19:7 See Deut 24:1.  § 19:9 Some manuscripts add And anyone who marries a divorced woman commits adultery.

NLT/Matthew 2	[Visitors from the East] 1 Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the reign of King Herod. About that time some wise men* from eastern lands arrived in Jerusalem, asking, §2 "Where is the newborn king of the Jews? We saw his star as it rose,* and we have come to worship him."§3 King Herod was deeply disturbed when he heard this, as was everyone in Jerusalem. §4 He called a meeting of the leading priests and teachers of religious law and asked, "Where is the Messiah supposed to be born?"§5 "In Bethlehem in Judea," they said, "for this is what the prophet wrote:§6 "And you, O Bethlehem in the land of Judah, are not least among the ruling cities* of Judah, for a ruler will come from you who will be the shepherd for my people Israel.'*"§7 Then Herod called for a private meeting with the wise men, and he learned from them the time when the star first appeared. §8 Then he told them, "Go to Bethlehem and search carefully for the child. And when you find him, come back and tell me so that I can go and worship him, too!"§9 After this interview the wise men went their way. And the star they had seen in the east guided them to Bethlehem. It went ahead of them and stopped over the place where the child was. §10 When they saw the star, they were filled with joy! §11 They entered the house and saw the child with his mother, Mary, and they bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasure chests and gave him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.§12 When it was time to leave, they returned to their own country by another route, for God had warned them in a dream not to return to Herod. §[The Escape to Egypt] 13 After the wise men were gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream. "Get up! Flee to Egypt with the child and his mother," the angel said. "Stay there until I tell you to return, because Herod is going to search for the child to kill him."§14 That night Joseph left for Egypt with the child and Mary, his mother, §15 and they stayed there until Herod's death. This fulfilled what the Lord had spoken through the prophet: "I called my Son out of Egypt."*Herod was furious when he realized that the wise men had outwitted him. He sent soldiers to kill all the boys in and around Bethlehem who were two years old and under, based on the wise men's report of the star's first appearance. §17 Herod's brutal action fulfilled what God had spoken through the prophet Jeremiah:§18 "A cry was heard in Ramah- weeping and great mourning. Rachel weeps for her children, refusing to be comforted, for they are dead."*When Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt. §20 "Get up!" the angel said. "Take the child and his mother back to the land of Israel, because those who were trying to kill the child are dead."§21 So Joseph got up and returned to the land of Israel with Jesus and his mother. §22 But when he learned that the new ruler of Judea was Herod's son Archelaus, he was afraid to go there. Then, after being warned in a dream, he left for the region of Galilee. §23 So the family went and lived in a town called Nazareth. This fulfilled what the prophets had said: "He will be called a Nazarene."       §§Footnotes:§ 2:1 Or royal astrologers; Greek reads magi; also in 2:7, 16.  § 2:2 Or star in the east.  § 2:6a Greek the rulers.  § 2:6b Mic 5:2; 2 Sam 5:2.  § 2:15 Hos 11:1. 16 § 2:18 Jer 31:15.  §[The Return to Nazareth] 19 §
NLT/Matthew 20	[Parable of the Vineyard Workers] 1 "For the Kingdom of Heaven is like the landowner who went out early one morning to hire workers for his vineyard.  §2 He agreed to pay the normal daily wage* and sent them out to work. 3 "At nine o'clock in the morning he was passing through the marketplace and saw some people standing around doing nothing.  §4 So he hired them, telling them he would pay them whatever was right at the end of the day.  §5 So they went to work in the vineyard. At noon and again at three o'clock he did the same thing. 6 "At five o'clock that afternoon he was in town again and saw some more people standing around. He asked them, "Why haven't you been working today?' 7 "They replied, "Because no one hired us.'  "The landowner told them, "Then go out and join the others in my vineyard.' 8 "That evening he told the foreman to call the workers in and pay them, beginning with the last workers first.  §9 When those hired at five o'clock were paid, each received a full day's wage.  §10 When those hired first came to get their pay, they assumed they would receive more. But they, too, were paid a day's wage.  §11 When they received their pay, they protested to the owner,  §12 "Those people worked only one hour, and yet you've paid them just as much as you paid us who worked all day in the scorching heat.' 13 "He answered one of them, "Friend, I haven't been unfair! Didn't you agree to work all day for the usual wage?  §14 Take your money and go. I wanted to pay this last worker the same as you.  §15 Is it against the law for me to do what I want with my money? Should you be jealous because I am kind to others?' 16 "So those who are last now will be first then, and those who are first will be last."  §[Jesus Again Predicts His Death] 17 As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside privately and told them what was going to happen to him. §18 "Listen,"  he said, "we're going up to Jerusalem, where the Son of Man* will be betrayed to the leading priests and the teachers of religious law. They will sentence him to die.  §19 Then they will hand him over to the Romans* to be mocked, flogged with a whip, and crucified. But on the third day he will be raised from the dead."  §[Jesus Teaches about Serving Others] 20 Then the mother of James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to Jesus with her sons. She knelt respectfully to ask a favor. §21 "What is your request?"  he asked. She replied, "In your Kingdom, please let my two sons sit in places of honor next to you, one on your right and the other on your left."§22 But Jesus answered by saying to them, "You don't know what you are asking! Are you able to drink from the bitter cup of suffering I am about to drink?"  "Oh yes," they replied, "we are able!"§23 Jesus told them, "You will indeed drink from my bitter cup. But I have no right to say who will sit on my right or my left. My Father has prepared those places for the ones he has chosen." 24 When the ten other disciples heard what James and John had asked, they were indignant. §25 But Jesus called them together and said, "You know that the rulers in this world lord it over their people, and officials flaunt their authority over those under them.  §26 But among you it will be different. Whoever wants to be a leader among you must be your servant,  §27 and whoever wants to be first among you must become your slave.  §28 For even the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve others and to give his life as a ransom for many."  §[Jesus Heals Two Blind Men] 29 As Jesus and the disciples left the town of Jericho, a large crowd followed behind. §30 Two blind men were sitting beside the road. When they heard that Jesus was coming that way, they began shouting, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!"§31 "Be quiet!" the crowd yelled at them. But they only shouted louder, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!"§32 When Jesus heard them, he stopped and called, "What do you want me to do for you?" 33 "Lord," they said, "we want to see!" §34 Jesus felt sorry for them and touched their eyes. Instantly they could see! Then they followed him.       §§Footnotes:§ 20:2 Greek a denarius, the payment for a full day's labor; similarly in 20:9, 10, 13.  § 20:18 "Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself.  § 20:19 Greek the Gentiles.  §
NLT/Matthew 21	[Jesus' Triumphant Entry] 1 As Jesus and the disciples approached Jerusalem, they came to the town of Bethphage on the Mount of Olives. Jesus sent two of them on ahead. §2 "Go into the village over there,"  he said. "As soon as you enter it, you will see a donkey tied there, with its colt beside it. Untie them and bring them to me.  §3 If anyone asks what you are doing, just say, "The Lord needs them,' and he will immediately let you take them." 4 This took place to fulfill the prophecy that said,§5 "Tell the people of Jerusalem,*"Look, your King is coming to you. He is humble, riding on a donkey- riding on a donkey's colt.'"*The two disciples did as Jesus commanded. §7 They brought the donkey and the colt to him and threw their garments over the colt, and he sat on it.*Most of the crowd spread their garments on the road ahead of him, and others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road. §9 Jesus was in the center of the procession, and the people all around him were shouting,  "Praise God* for the Son of David! Blessings on the one who comes in the name of the Lord ! Praise God in highest heaven!"*The entire city of Jerusalem was in an uproar as he entered. "Who is this?" they asked.§11 And the crowds replied, "It's Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." §[Jesus Clears the Temple] 12 Jesus entered the Temple and began to drive out all the people buying and selling animals for sacrifice. He knocked over the tables of the money changers and the chairs of those selling doves. §13 He said to them, "The Scriptures declare, "My Temple will be called a house of prayer,' but you have turned it into a den of thieves!"*The blind and the lame came to him in the Temple, and he healed them. §15 The leading priests and the teachers of religious law saw these wonderful miracles and heard even the children in the Temple shouting, "Praise God for the Son of David." But the leaders were indignant. §16 They asked Jesus, "Do you hear what these children are saying?" "Yes,"  Jesus replied. "Haven't you ever read the Scriptures? For they say, "You have taught children and infants to give you praise.'*"  §17 Then he returned to Bethany, where he stayed overnight. §[Jesus Curses the Fig Tree] 18 In the morning, as Jesus was returning to Jerusalem, he was hungry, §19 and he noticed a fig tree beside the road. He went over to see if there were any figs, but there were only leaves. Then he said to it, "May you never bear fruit again!"  And immediately the fig tree withered up.§20 The disciples were amazed when they saw this and asked, "How did the fig tree wither so quickly?"§21 Then Jesus told them, "I tell you the truth, if you have faith and don't doubt, you can do things like this and much more. You can even say to this mountain, "May you be lifted up and thrown into the sea,' and it will happen.  §22 You can pray for anything, and if you have faith, you will receive it."  §[The Authority of Jesus Challenged] 23 When Jesus returned to the Temple and began teaching, the leading priests and elders came up to him. They demanded, "By what authority are you doing all these things? Who gave you the right?"§24 "I'll tell you by what authority I do these things if you answer one question,"  Jesus replied. §25 "Did John's authority to baptize come from heaven, or was it merely human?"  They talked it over among themselves. "If we say it was from heaven, he will ask us why we didn't believe John. §26 But if we say it was merely human, we'll be mobbed because the people believe John was a prophet." §27 So they finally replied, "We don't know." And Jesus responded, "Then I won't tell you by what authority I do these things.  §[Parable of the Two Sons] 28 "But what do you think about this? A man with two sons told the older boy, "Son, go out and work in the vineyard today.'  §29 The son answered, "No, I won't go,' but later he changed his mind and went anyway.  §30 Then the father told the other son, "You go,' and he said, "Yes, sir, I will.' But he didn't go. 31 "Which of the two obeyed his father?"  They replied, "The first."*Then Jesus explained his meaning: "I tell you the truth, corrupt tax collectors and prostitutes will get into the Kingdom of God before you do.  §32 For John the Baptist came and showed you the right way to live, but you didn't believe him, while tax collectors and prostitutes did. And even when you saw this happening, you refused to believe him and repent of your sins.  §[Parable of the Evil Farmers] 33 "Now listen to another story. A certain landowner planted a vineyard, built a wall around it, dug a pit for pressing out the grape juice, and built a lookout tower. Then he leased the vineyard to tenant farmers and moved to another country.  §34 At the time of the grape harvest, he sent his servants to collect his share of the crop.  §35 But the farmers grabbed his servants, beat one, killed one, and stoned another.  §36 So the landowner sent a larger group of his servants to collect for him, but the results were the same. 37 "Finally, the owner sent his son, thinking, "Surely they will respect my son.' 38 "But when the tenant farmers saw his son coming, they said to one another, "Here comes the heir to this estate. Come on, let's kill him and get the estate for ourselves!'  §39 So they grabbed him, dragged him out of the vineyard, and murdered him. 40 "When the owner of the vineyard returns,"  Jesus asked, "what do you think he will do to those farmers?" 41 The religious leaders replied, "He will put the wicked men to a horrible death and lease the vineyard to others who will give him his share of the crop after each harvest."§42 Then Jesus asked them, "Didn't you ever read this in the Scriptures?  "The stone that the builders rejected  has now become the cornerstone.  This is the  Lord  's doing,  and it is wonderful to see.'*I tell you, the Kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a nation that will produce the proper fruit.  §44 Anyone who stumbles over that stone will be broken to pieces, and it will crush anyone it falls on.*" 45 When the leading priests and Pharisees heard this parable, they realized he was telling the story against them-they were the wicked farmers. §46 They wanted to arrest him, but they were afraid of the crowds, who considered Jesus to be a prophet.       §§Footnotes:§ 21:5a Greek Tell the daughter of Zion.

In still other manuscripts the first son says "Yes" but does nothing, the second son says "No" but then repents and goes, and the answer to Jesus' question is that the second son obeyed his father.  § 21:42 Ps 118:22-23.  43 § 21:44 This verse is not included in some early manuscripts. Compare Luke 20:18.  §
NLT/Matthew 22	[Parable of the Great Feast] 1 Jesus also told them other parables. He said, §2 "The Kingdom of Heaven can be illustrated by the story of a king who prepared a great wedding feast for his son.  §3 When the banquet was ready, he sent his servants to notify those who were invited. But they all refused to come! 4 "So he sent other servants to tell them, "The feast has been prepared. The bulls and fattened cattle have been killed, and everything is ready. Come to the banquet!'  §5 But the guests he had invited ignored them and went their own way, one to his farm, another to his business.  §6 Others seized his messengers and insulted them and killed them. 7 "The king was furious, and he sent out his army to destroy the murderers and burn their town.  §8 And he said to his servants, "The wedding feast is ready, and the guests I invited aren't worthy of the honor.  §9 Now go out to the street corners and invite everyone you see.'  §10 So the servants brought in everyone they could find, good and bad alike, and the banquet hall was filled with guests. 11 "But when the king came in to meet the guests, he noticed a man who wasn't wearing the proper clothes for a wedding.  §12 "Friend,' he asked, "how is it that you are here without wedding clothes?' But the man had no reply.  §13 Then the king said to his aides, "Bind his hands and feet and throw him into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.' 14 "For many are called, but few are chosen."  §[Taxes for Caesar] 15 Then the Pharisees met together to plot how to trap Jesus into saying something for which he could be arrested. §16 They sent some of their disciples, along with the supporters of Herod, to meet with him. "Teacher," they said, "we know how honest you are. You teach the way of God truthfully. You are impartial and don't play favorites. §17 Now tell us what you think about this: Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?"§18 But Jesus knew their evil motives. "You hypocrites!"  he said. "Why are you trying to trap me?  §19 Here, show me the coin used for the tax."  When they handed him a Roman coin,* §20 he asked, "Whose picture and title are stamped on it?" 21 "Caesar's," they replied. "Well, then,"  he said, "give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar, and give to God what belongs to God." 22 His reply amazed them, and they went away. §[Discussion about Resurrection] 23 That same day Jesus was approached by some Sadducees-religious leaders who say there is no resurrection from the dead. They posed this question: §24 "Teacher, Moses said, "If a man dies without children, his brother should marry the widow and have a child who will carry on the brother's name.'* §25 Well, suppose there were seven brothers. The oldest one married and then died without children, so his brother married the widow. §26 But the second brother also died, and the third brother married her. This continued with all seven of them. §27 Last of all, the woman also died. §28 So tell us, whose wife will she be in the resurrection? For all seven were married to her."§29 Jesus replied, "Your mistake is that you don't know the Scriptures, and you don't know the power of God.  §30 For when the dead rise, they will neither marry nor be given in marriage. In this respect they will be like the angels in heaven. 31 "But now, as to whether there will be a resurrection of the dead-haven't you ever read about this in the Scriptures? Long after Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob had died, God said,* §32 "I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.'* So he is the God of the living, not the dead." 33 When the crowds heard him, they were astounded at his teaching. §[The Most Important Commandment] 34 But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees with his reply, they met together to question him again. §35 One of them, an expert in religious law, tried to trap him with this question: §36 "Teacher, which is the most important commandment in the law of Moses?"§37 Jesus replied, ""You must love the  Lord  your God with all your heart, all your soul, and all your mind.'* §38 This is the first and greatest commandment.  §39 A second is equally important: "Love your neighbor as yourself.'* §40 The entire law and all the demands of the prophets are based on these two commandments."  §[Whose Son Is the Messiah?] 41 Then, surrounded by the Pharisees, Jesus asked them a question: §42 "What do you think about the Messiah? Whose son is he?"  They replied, "He is the son of David."§43 Jesus responded, "Then why does David, speaking under the inspiration of the Spirit, call the Messiah "my Lord'? For David said, §44 "The  Lord  said to my Lord,  Sit in the place of honor at my right hand  until I humble your enemies beneath your feet.'*Since David called the Messiah "my Lord,' how can the Messiah be his son?" 46 No one could answer him. And after that, no one dared to ask him any more questions.       §§Footnotes:§ 22:19 Greek a denarius.  § 22:24 Deut 25:5-6.  § 22:31 Greek read about this?

NLT/Matthew 23	[Jesus Criticizes the Religious Leaders] 1 Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples, §2 "The teachers of religious law and the Pharisees are the official interpreters of the law of Moses.* §3 So practice and obey whatever they tell you, but don't follow their example. For they don't practice what they teach.  §4 They crush people with unbearable religious demands and never lift a finger to ease the burden. 5 "Everything they do is for show. On their arms they wear extra wide prayer boxes with Scripture verses inside, and they wear robes with extra long tassels.* §6 And they love to sit at the head table at banquets and in the seats of honor in the synagogues.  §7 They love to receive respectful greetings as they walk in the marketplaces, and to be called "Rabbi.'*"Don't let anyone call you "Rabbi,' for you have only one teacher, and all of you are equal as brothers and sisters.* §9 And don't address anyone here on earth as "Father,' for only God in heaven is your Father.  §10 And don't let anyone call you "Teacher,' for you have only one teacher, the Messiah.  §11 The greatest among you must be a servant.  §12 But those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted. 13 "What sorrow awaits you teachers of religious law and you Pharisees. Hypocrites! For you shut the door of the Kingdom of Heaven in people's faces. You won't go in yourselves, and you don't let others enter either.*"What sorrow awaits you teachers of religious law and you Pharisees. Hypocrites! For you cross land and sea to make one convert, and then you turn that person into twice the child of hell* you yourselves are! 16 "Blind guides! What sorrow awaits you! For you say that it means nothing to swear "by God's Temple,' but that it is binding to swear "by the gold in the Temple.'  §17 Blind fools! Which is more important-the gold or the Temple that makes the gold sacred?  §18 And you say that to swear "by the altar' is not binding, but to swear "by the gifts on the altar' is binding.  §19 How blind! For which is more important-the gift on the altar or the altar that makes the gift sacred?  §20 When you swear "by the altar,' you are swearing by it and by everything on it.  §21 And when you swear "by the Temple,' you are swearing by it and by God, who lives in it.  §22 And when you swear "by heaven,' you are swearing by the throne of God and by God, who sits on the throne. 23 "What sorrow awaits you teachers of religious law and you Pharisees. Hypocrites! For you are careful to tithe even the tiniest income from your herb gardens,* but you ignore the more important aspects of the law-justice, mercy, and faith. You should tithe, yes, but do not neglect the more important things.  §24 Blind guides! You strain your water so you won't accidentally swallow a gnat, but you swallow a camel!*"What sorrow awaits you teachers of religious law and you Pharisees. Hypocrites! For you are so careful to clean the outside of the cup and the dish, but inside you are filthy-full of greed and self-indulgence!  §26 You blind Pharisee! First wash the inside of the cup and the dish,* and then the outside will become clean, too. 27 "What sorrow awaits you teachers of religious law and you Pharisees. Hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs-beautiful on the outside but filled on the inside with dead people's bones and all sorts of impurity.  §28 Outwardly you look like righteous people, but inwardly your hearts are filled with hypocrisy and lawlessness. 29 "What sorrow awaits you teachers of religious law and you Pharisees. Hypocrites! For you build tombs for the prophets your ancestors killed, and you decorate the monuments of the godly people your ancestors destroyed.  §30 Then you say, "If we had lived in the days of our ancestors, we would never have joined them in killing the prophets.' 31 "But in saying that, you testify against yourselves that you are indeed the descendants of those who murdered the prophets.  §32 Go ahead and finish what your ancestors started.  §33 Snakes! Sons of vipers! How will you escape the judgment of hell? 34 "Therefore, I am sending you prophets and wise men and teachers of religious law. But you will kill some by crucifixion, and you will flog others with whips in your synagogues, chasing them from city to city.  §35 As a result, you will be held responsible for the murder of all godly people of all time-from the murder of righteous Abel to the murder of Zechariah son of Berekiah, whom you killed in the Temple between the sanctuary and the altar.  §36 I tell you the truth, this judgment will fall on this very generation.  §[Jesus Grieves over Jerusalem] 37 "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that kills the prophets and stones God's messengers! How often I have wanted to gather your children together as a hen protects her chicks beneath her wings, but you wouldn't let me.  §38 And now, look, your house is abandoned and desolate.* §39 For I tell you this, you will never see me again until you say, "Blessings on the one who comes in the name of the  Lord  !'*"        §§Footnotes:§ 23:2 Greek and the Pharisees sit in the seat of Moses.  § 23:5 Greek They enlarge their phylacteries and lengthen their tassels.  § 23:7 Rabbi, from Aramaic, means "master" or "teacher."  8 § 23:8 Greek brothers.  § 23:13 Some manuscripts add verse 14, What sorrow awaits you teachers of religious law and you Pharisees.

NLT/Matthew 24	[Jesus Speaks about the Future] 1 As Jesus was leaving the Temple grounds, his disciples pointed out to him the various Temple buildings. §2 But he responded, "Do you see all these buildings? I tell you the truth, they will be completely demolished. Not one stone will be left on top of another!" 3 Later, Jesus sat on the Mount of Olives. His disciples came to him privately and said, "Tell us, when will all this happen? What sign will signal your return and the end of the world?*"§4 Jesus told them, "Don't let anyone mislead you,  §5 for many will come in my name, claiming, "I am the Messiah.' They will deceive many.  §6 And you will hear of wars and threats of wars, but don't panic. Yes, these things must take place, but the end won't follow immediately.  §7 Nation will go to war against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in many parts of the world.  §8 But all this is only the first of the birth pains, with more to come. 9 "Then you will be arrested, persecuted, and killed. You will be hated all over the world because you are my followers.* §10 And many will turn away from me and betray and hate each other.  §11 And many false prophets will appear and will deceive many people.  §12 Sin will be rampant everywhere, and the love of many will grow cold.  §13 But the one who endures to the end will be saved.  §14 And the Good News about the Kingdom will be preached throughout the whole world, so that all nations* will hear it; and then the end will come. 15 "The day is coming when you will see what Daniel the prophet spoke about-the sacrilegious object that causes desecration* standing in the Holy Place."  (Reader, pay attention!) §16 "Then those in Judea must flee to the hills.  §17 A person out on the deck of a roof must not go down into the house to pack.  §18 A person out in the field must not return even to get a coat.  §19 How terrible it will be for pregnant women and for nursing mothers in those days.  §20 And pray that your flight will not be in winter or on the Sabbath.  §21 For there will be greater anguish than at any time since the world began. And it will never be so great again.  §22 In fact, unless that time of calamity is shortened, not a single person will survive. But it will be shortened for the sake of God's chosen ones. 23 "Then if anyone tells you, "Look, here is the Messiah,' or "There he is,' don't believe it.  §24 For false messiahs and false prophets will rise up and perform great signs and wonders so as to deceive, if possible, even God's chosen ones.  §25 See, I have warned you about this ahead of time. 26 "So if someone tells you, "Look, the Messiah is out in the desert,' don't bother to go and look. Or, "Look, he is hiding here,' don't believe it!  §27 For as the lightning flashes in the east and shines to the west, so it will be when the Son of Man* comes.  §28 Just as the gathering of vultures shows there is a carcass nearby, so these signs indicate that the end is near.*"Immediately after the anguish of those days,  the sun will be darkened,  the moon will give no light,  the stars will fall from the sky,  and the powers in the heavens will be shaken.*And then at last, the sign that the Son of Man is coming will appear in the heavens, and there will be deep mourning among all the peoples of the earth. And they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.* §31 And he will send out his angels with the mighty blast of a trumpet, and they will gather his chosen ones from all over the world*-from the farthest ends of the earth and heaven. 32 "Now learn a lesson from the fig tree. When its branches bud and its leaves begin to sprout, you know that summer is near.  §33 In the same way, when you see all these things, you can know his return is very near, right at the door.  §34 I tell you the truth, this generation* will not pass from the scene until all these things take place.  §35 Heaven and earth will disappear, but my words will never disappear. 36 "However, no one knows the day or hour when these things will happen, not even the angels in heaven or the Son himself.* Only the Father knows. 37 "When the Son of Man returns, it will be like it was in Noah's day.  §38 In those days before the flood, the people were enjoying banquets and parties and weddings right up to the time Noah entered his boat.  §39 People didn't realize what was going to happen until the flood came and swept them all away. That is the way it will be when the Son of Man comes. 40 "Two men will be working together in the field; one will be taken, the other left.  §41 Two women will be grinding flour at the mill; one will be taken, the other left. 42 "So you, too, must keep watch! For you don't know what day your Lord is coming.  §43 Understand this: If a homeowner knew exactly when a burglar was coming, he would keep watch and not permit his house to be broken into.  §44 You also must be ready all the time, for the Son of Man will come when least expected. 45 "A faithful, sensible servant is one to whom the master can give the responsibility of managing his other household servants and feeding them.  §46 If the master returns and finds that the servant has done a good job, there will be a reward.  §47 I tell you the truth, the master will put that servant in charge of all he owns.  §48 But what if the servant is evil and thinks, "My master won't be back for a while,'  §49 and he begins beating the other servants, partying, and getting drunk?  §50 The master will return unannounced and unexpected,  §51 and he will cut the servant to pieces and assign him a place with the hypocrites. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.        §§Footnotes:§ 24:3 Or the age?  § 24:9 Greek on account of my name.  § 24:14 Or all peoples.  § 24:15 Greek the abomination of desolation.

NLT/Matthew 25	[Parable of the Ten Bridesmaids] 1 "Then the Kingdom of Heaven will be like ten bridesmaids* who took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom.  §2 Five of them were foolish, and five were wise.  §3 The five who were foolish didn't take enough olive oil for their lamps,  §4 but the other five were wise enough to take along extra oil.  §5 When the bridegroom was delayed, they all became drowsy and fell asleep. 6 "At midnight they were roused by the shout, "Look, the bridegroom is coming! Come out and meet him!' 7 "All the bridesmaids got up and prepared their lamps.  §8 Then the five foolish ones asked the others, "Please give us some of your oil because our lamps are going out.' 9 "But the others replied, "We don't have enough for all of us. Go to a shop and buy some for yourselves.' 10 "But while they were gone to buy oil, the bridegroom came. Then those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was locked.  §11 Later, when the other five bridesmaids returned, they stood outside, calling, "Lord! Lord! Open the door for us!' 12 "But he called back, "Believe me, I don't know you!' 13 "So you, too, must keep watch! For you do not know the day or hour of my return.  §[Parable of the Three Servants] 14 "Again, the Kingdom of Heaven can be illustrated by the story of a man going on a long trip. He called together his servants and entrusted his money to them while he was gone.  §15 He gave five bags of silver* to one, two bags of silver to another, and one bag of silver to the last-dividing it in proportion to their abilities. He then left on his trip. 16 "The servant who received the five bags of silver began to invest the money and earned five more.  §17 The servant with two bags of silver also went to work and earned two more.  §18 But the servant who received the one bag of silver dug a hole in the ground and hid the master's money. 19 "After a long time their master returned from his trip and called them to give an account of how they had used his money.  §20 The servant to whom he had entrusted the five bags of silver came forward with five more and said, "Master, you gave me five bags of silver to invest, and I have earned five more.' 21 "The master was full of praise. "Well done, my good and faithful servant. You have been faithful in handling this small amount, so now I will give you many more responsibilities. Let's celebrate together!*' 22 "The servant who had received the two bags of silver came forward and said, "Master, you gave me two bags of silver to invest, and I have earned two more.' 23 "The master said, "Well done, my good and faithful servant. You have been faithful in handling this small amount, so now I will give you many more responsibilities. Let's celebrate together!' 24 "Then the servant with the one bag of silver came and said, "Master, I knew you were a harsh man, harvesting crops you didn't plant and gathering crops you didn't cultivate.  §25 I was afraid I would lose your money, so I hid it in the earth. Look, here is your money back.' 26 "But the master replied, "You wicked and lazy servant! If you knew I harvested crops I didn't plant and gathered crops I didn't cultivate,  §27 why didn't you deposit my money in the bank? At least I could have gotten some interest on it.' 28 "Then he ordered, "Take the money from this servant, and give it to the one with the ten bags of silver.  §29 To those who use well what they are given, even more will be given, and they will have an abundance. But from those who do nothing, even what little they have will be taken away.  §30 Now throw this useless servant into outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'  §[The Final Judgment] 31 "But when the Son of Man* comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit upon his glorious throne.  §32 All the nations* will be gathered in his presence, and he will separate the people as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.  §33 He will place the sheep at his right hand and the goats at his left. 34 "Then the King will say to those on his right, "Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the creation of the world.  §35 For I was hungry, and you fed me. I was thirsty, and you gave me a drink. I was a stranger, and you invited me into your home.  §36 I was naked, and you gave me clothing. I was sick, and you cared for me. I was in prison, and you visited me.' 37 "Then these righteous ones will reply, "Lord, when did we ever see you hungry and feed you? Or thirsty and give you something to drink?  §38 Or a stranger and show you hospitality? Or naked and give you clothing?  §39 When did we ever see you sick or in prison and visit you?' 40 "And the King will say, "I tell you the truth, when you did it to one of the least of these my brothers and sisters,* you were doing it to me!' 41 "Then the King will turn to those on the left and say, "Away with you, you cursed ones, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his demons.* §42 For I was hungry, and you didn't feed me. I was thirsty, and you didn't give me a drink.  §43 I was a stranger, and you didn't invite me into your home. I was naked, and you didn't give me clothing. I was sick and in prison, and you didn't visit me.' §44 "Then they will reply, "Lord, when did we ever see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and not help you?' §45 "And he will answer, "I tell you the truth, when you refused to help the least of these my brothers and sisters, you were refusing to help me.' §46 "And they will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous will go into eternal life."        §§Footnotes:§ 25:1 Or virgins; also in 25:7, 11.  § 25:15 Greek talents; also throughout the story.

NLT/Matthew 26	[The Plot to Kill Jesus] 1 When Jesus had finished saying all these things, he said to his disciples, §2 "As you know, Passover begins in two days, and the Son of Man* will be handed over to be crucified." 3 At that same time the leading priests and elders were meeting at the residence of Caiaphas, the high priest, §4 plotting how to capture Jesus secretly and kill him. §5 "But not during the Passover celebration," they agreed, "or the people may riot." §[Jesus Anointed at Bethany] 6 Meanwhile, Jesus was in Bethany at the home of Simon, a man who had previously had leprosy. §7 While he was eating,* a woman came in with a beautiful alabaster jar of expensive perfume and poured it over his head.§8 The disciples were indignant when they saw this. "What a waste!" they said. §9 "It could have been sold for a high price and the money given to the poor."§10 But Jesus, aware of this, replied, "Why criticize this woman for doing such a good thing to me?  §11 You will always have the poor among you, but you will not always have me.  §12 She has poured this perfume on me to prepare my body for burial.  §13 I tell you the truth, wherever the Good News is preached throughout the world, this woman's deed will be remembered and discussed."  §[Judas Agrees to Betray Jesus] 14 Then Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve disciples, went to the leading priests §15 and asked, "How much will you pay me to betray Jesus to you?" And they gave him thirty pieces of silver. §16 From that time on, Judas began looking for an opportunity to betray Jesus. §[The Last Supper] 17 On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to prepare the Passover meal for you?"§18 "As you go into the city,"  he told them, "you will see a certain man. Tell him, "The Teacher says: My time has come, and I will eat the Passover meal with my disciples at your house.'"  §19 So the disciples did as Jesus told them and prepared the Passover meal there.§20 When it was evening, Jesus sat down at the table* with the Twelve. §21 While they were eating, he said, "I tell you the truth, one of you will betray me." 22 Greatly distressed, each one asked in turn, "Am I the one, Lord?"§23 He replied, "One of you who has just eaten from this bowl with me will betray me.  §24 For the Son of Man must die, as the Scriptures declared long ago. But how terrible it will be for the one who betrays him. It would be far better for that man if he had never been born!" 25 Judas, the one who would betray him, also asked, "Rabbi, am I the one?" And Jesus told him, "You have said it." 26 As they were eating, Jesus took some bread and blessed it. Then he broke it in pieces and gave it to the disciples, saying, "Take this and eat it, for this is my body." 27 And he took a cup of wine and gave thanks to God for it. He gave it to them and said, "Each of you drink from it,  §28 for this is my blood, which confirms the covenant* between God and his people. It is poured out as a sacrifice to forgive the sins of many.  §29 Mark my words-I will not drink wine again until the day I drink it new with you in my Father's Kingdom." 30 Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives. §[Jesus Predicts Peter's Denial] 31 On the way, Jesus told them, "Tonight all of you will desert me. For the Scriptures say,  "God will strike* the Shepherd,  and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.' 32 But after I have been raised from the dead, I will go ahead of you to Galilee and meet you there." 33 Peter declared, "Even if everyone else deserts you, I will never desert you."§34 Jesus replied, "I tell you the truth, Peter-this very night, before the rooster crows, you will deny three times that you even know me." 35 "No!" Peter insisted. "Even if I have to die with you, I will never deny you!" And all the other disciples vowed the same. §[Jesus Prays in Gethsemane] 36 Then Jesus went with them to the olive grove called Gethsemane, and he said, "Sit here while I go over there to pray."  §37 He took Peter and Zebedee's two sons, James and John, and he became anguished and distressed. §38 He told them, "My soul is crushed with grief to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with me." 39 He went on a little farther and bowed with his face to the ground, praying, "My Father! If it is possible, let this cup of suffering be taken away from me. Yet I want your will to be done, not mine." 40 Then he returned to the disciples and found them asleep. He said to Peter, "Couldn't you watch with me even one hour?  §41 Keep watch and pray, so that you will not give in to temptation. For the spirit is willing, but the body is weak!" 42 Then Jesus left them a second time and prayed, "My Father! If this cup cannot be taken away* unless I drink it, your will be done."  §43 When he returned to them again, he found them sleeping, for they couldn't keep their eyes open.§44 So he went to pray a third time, saying the same things again. §45 Then he came to the disciples and said, "Go ahead and sleep. Have your rest. But look-the time has come. The Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.  §46 Up, let's be going. Look, my betrayer is here!"  §[Jesus Is Betrayed and Arrested] 47 And even as Jesus said this, Judas, one of the twelve disciples, arrived with a crowd of men armed with swords and clubs. They had been sent by the leading priests and elders of the people. §48 The traitor, Judas, had given them a prearranged signal: "You will know which one to arrest when I greet him with a kiss." §49 So Judas came straight to Jesus. "Greetings, Rabbi!" he exclaimed and gave him the kiss.§50 Jesus said, "My friend, go ahead and do what you have come for."  Then the others grabbed Jesus and arrested him. §51 But one of the men with Jesus pulled out his sword and struck the high priest's slave, slashing off his ear.§52 "Put away your sword,"  Jesus told him. "Those who use the sword will die by the sword.  §53 Don't you realize that I could ask my Father for thousands* of angels to protect us, and he would send them instantly?  §54 But if I did, how would the Scriptures be fulfilled that describe what must happen now?" 55 Then Jesus said to the crowd, "Am I some dangerous revolutionary, that you come with swords and clubs to arrest me? Why didn't you arrest me in the Temple? I was there teaching every day.  §56 But this is all happening to fulfill the words of the prophets as recorded in the Scriptures."  At that point, all the disciples deserted him and fled. §[Jesus before the Council] 57 Then the people who had arrested Jesus led him to the home of Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of religious law and the elders had gathered. §58 Meanwhile, Peter followed him at a distance and came to the high priest's courtyard. He went in and sat with the guards and waited to see how it would all end.§59 Inside, the leading priests and the entire high council* were trying to find witnesses who would lie about Jesus, so they could put him to death. §60 But even though they found many who agreed to give false witness, they could not use anyone's testimony. Finally, two men came forward §61 who declared, "This man said, "I am able to destroy the Temple of God and rebuild it in three days.'"§62 Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, "Well, aren't you going to answer these charges? What do you have to say for yourself?" §63 But Jesus remained silent. Then the high priest said to him, "I demand in the name of the living God-tell us if you are the Messiah, the Son of God."§64 Jesus replied, "You have said it. And in the future you will see the Son of Man seated in the place of power at God's right hand* and coming on the clouds of heaven."*Then the high priest tore his clothing to show his horror and said, "Blasphemy! Why do we need other witnesses? You have all heard his blasphemy. §66 What is your verdict?" "Guilty!" they shouted. "He deserves to die!"§67 Then they began to spit in Jesus' face and beat him with their fists. And some slapped him, §68 jeering, "Prophesy to us, you Messiah! Who hit you that time?" §[Peter Denies Jesus] 69 Meanwhile, Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. A servant girl came over and said to him, "You were one of those with Jesus the Galilean."§70 But Peter denied it in front of everyone. "I don't know what you're talking about," he said.§71 Later, out by the gate, another servant girl noticed him and said to those standing around, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth.*"§72 Again Peter denied it, this time with an oath. "I don't even know the man," he said.§73 A little later some of the other bystanders came over to Peter and said, "You must be one of them; we can tell by your Galilean accent."§74 Peter swore, "A curse on me if I'm lying-I don't know the man!" And immediately the rooster crowed.§75 Suddenly, Jesus' words flashed through Peter's mind: "Before the rooster crows, you will deny three times that you even know me."  And he went away, weeping bitterly.       §§Footnotes:§ 26:2 "Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself.  § 26:7 Or reclining.  § 26:20 Or Jesus reclined.  § 26:28 Some manuscripts read the new covenant.  § 26:31 Greek I will strike.

NLT/Matthew 27	[Judas Hangs Himself] 1 Very early in the morning the leading priests and the elders of the people met again to lay plans for putting Jesus to death. §2 Then they bound him, led him away, and took him to Pilate, the Roman governor.§3 When Judas, who had betrayed him, realized that Jesus had been condemned to die, he was filled with remorse. So he took the thirty pieces of silver back to the leading priests and the elders. §4 "I have sinned," he declared, "for I have betrayed an innocent man." "What do we care?" they retorted. "That's your problem."§5 Then Judas threw the silver coins down in the Temple and went out and hanged himself.§6 The leading priests picked up the coins. "It wouldn't be right to put this money in the Temple treasury," they said, "since it was payment for murder."* §7 After some discussion they finally decided to buy the potter's field, and they made it into a cemetery for foreigners. §8 That is why the field is still called the Field of Blood. §9 This fulfilled the prophecy of Jeremiah that says, "They took* the thirty pieces of silver- the price at which he was valued by the people of Israel,§10 and purchased the potter's field, as the Lord  directed.*" §[Jesus' Trial before Pilate] 11 Now Jesus was standing before Pilate, the Roman governor. "Are you the king of the Jews?" the governor asked him. Jesus replied, "You have said it."  §12 But when the leading priests and the elders made their accusations against him, Jesus remained silent. §13 "Don't you hear all these charges they are bringing against you?" Pilate demanded. §14 But Jesus made no response to any of the charges, much to the governor's surprise.§15 Now it was the governor's custom each year during the Passover celebration to release one prisoner to the crowd-anyone they wanted. §16 This year there was a notorious prisoner, a man named Barabbas.* §17 As the crowds gathered before Pilate's house that morning, he asked them, "Which one do you want me to release to you-Barabbas, or Jesus who is called the Messiah?" §18 (He knew very well that the religious leaders had arrested Jesus out of envy.)§19 Just then, as Pilate was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him this message: "Leave that innocent man alone. I suffered through a terrible nightmare about him last night."§20 Meanwhile, the leading priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas to be released and for Jesus to be put to death. §21 So the governor asked again, "Which of these two do you want me to release to you?" The crowd shouted back, "Barabbas!"§22 Pilate responded, "Then what should I do with Jesus who is called the Messiah?" They shouted back, "Crucify him!"§23 "Why?" Pilate demanded. "What crime has he committed?" But the mob roared even louder, "Crucify him!"§24 Pilate saw that he wasn't getting anywhere and that a riot was developing. So he sent for a bowl of water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, "I am innocent of this man's blood. The responsibility is yours!"§25 And all the people yelled back, "We will take responsibility for his death-we and our children!"*So Pilate released Barabbas to them. He ordered Jesus flogged with a lead-tipped whip, then turned him over to the Roman soldiers to be crucified. §[The Soldiers Mock Jesus] 27 Some of the governor's soldiers took Jesus into their headquarters* and called out the entire regiment. §28 They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him. §29 They wove thorn branches into a crown and put it on his head, and they placed a reed stick in his right hand as a scepter. Then they knelt before him in mockery and taunted, "Hail! King of the Jews!" §30 And they spit on him and grabbed the stick and struck him on the head with it. §31 When they were finally tired of mocking him, they took off the robe and put his own clothes on him again. Then they led him away to be crucified. §[The Crucifixion] 32 Along the way, they came across a man named Simon, who was from Cyrene,* and the soldiers forced him to carry Jesus' cross. §33 And they went out to a place called Golgotha (which means "Place of the Skull"). §34 The soldiers gave Jesus wine mixed with bitter gall, but when he had tasted it, he refused to drink it.§35 After they had nailed him to the cross, the soldiers gambled for his clothes by throwing dice.* §36 Then they sat around and kept guard as he hung there. §37 A sign was fastened above Jesus' head, announcing the charge against him. It read: "This is Jesus, the King of the Jews." §38 Two revolutionaries* were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.§39 The people passing by shouted abuse, shaking their heads in mockery. §40 "Look at you now!" they yelled at him. "You said you were going to destroy the Temple and rebuild it in three days. Well then, if you are the Son of God, save yourself and come down from the cross!"§41 The leading priests, the teachers of religious law, and the elders also mocked Jesus. §42 "He saved others," they scoffed, "but he can't save himself! So he is the King of Israel, is he? Let him come down from the cross right now, and we will believe in him! §43 He trusted God, so let God rescue him now if he wants him! For he said, "I am the Son of God.'" §44 Even the revolutionaries who were crucified with him ridiculed him in the same way. §[The Death of Jesus] 45 At noon, darkness fell across the whole land until three o'clock. §46 At about three o'clock, Jesus called out with a loud voice, "Eli, Eli,* lema sabachthani?"  which means "My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?"*Some of the bystanders misunderstood and thought he was calling for the prophet Elijah. §48 One of them ran and filled a sponge with sour wine, holding it up to him on a reed stick so he could drink. §49 But the rest said, "Wait! Let's see whether Elijah comes to save him."*Then Jesus shouted out again, and he released his spirit. §51 At that moment the curtain in the sanctuary of the Temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. The earth shook, rocks split apart, §52 and tombs opened. The bodies of many godly men and women who had died were raised from the dead. §53 They left the cemetery after Jesus' resurrection, went into the holy city of Jerusalem, and appeared to many people.§54 The Roman officer* and the other soldiers at the crucifixion were terrified by the earthquake and all that had happened. They said, "This man truly was the Son of God!"§55 And many women who had come from Galilee with Jesus to care for him were watching from a distance. §56 Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary (the mother of James and Joseph), and the mother of James and John, the sons of Zebedee. §[The Burial of Jesus] 57 As evening approached, Joseph, a rich man from Arimathea who had become a follower of Jesus, §58 went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. And Pilate issued an order to release it to him. §59 Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a long sheet of clean linen cloth. §60 He placed it in his own new tomb, which had been carved out of the rock. Then he rolled a great stone across the entrance and left. §61 Both Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting across from the tomb and watching. §[The Guard at the Tomb] 62 The next day, on the Sabbath,* the leading priests and Pharisees went to see Pilate. §63 They told him, "Sir, we remember what that deceiver once said while he was still alive: "After three days I will rise from the dead.' §64 So we request that you seal the tomb until the third day. This will prevent his disciples from coming and stealing his body and then telling everyone he was raised from the dead! If that happens, we'll be worse off than we were at first."§65 Pilate replied, "Take guards and secure it the best you can." §66 So they sealed the tomb and posted guards to protect it.       §§Footnotes:§ 27:6 Greek since it is the price for blood.  § 27:9 Or I took.  § 27:9-10 Greek as the Lord  directed me.

NLT/Matthew 28	[The Resurrection] 1 Early on Sunday morning,* as the new day was dawning, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went out to visit the tomb.§2 Suddenly there was a great earthquake! For an angel of the Lord came down from heaven, rolled aside the stone, and sat on it. §3 His face shone like lightning, and his clothing was as white as snow. §4 The guards shook with fear when they saw him, and they fell into a dead faint.§5 Then the angel spoke to the women. "Don't be afraid!" he said. "I know you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified. §6 He isn't here! He is risen from the dead, just as he said would happen. Come, see where his body was lying. §7 And now, go quickly and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead, and he is going ahead of you to Galilee. You will see him there. Remember what I have told you."§8 The women ran quickly from the tomb. They were very frightened but also filled with great joy, and they rushed to give the disciples the angel's message. §9 And as they went, Jesus met them and greeted them. And they ran to him, grasped his feet, and worshiped him. §10 Then Jesus said to them, "Don't be afraid! Go tell my brothers to leave for Galilee, and they will see me there."  §[The Report of the Guard] 11 As the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and told the leading priests what had happened. §12 A meeting with the elders was called, and they decided to give the soldiers a large bribe. §13 They told the soldiers, "You must say, "Jesus' disciples came during the night while we were sleeping, and they stole his body.' §14 If the governor hears about it, we'll stand up for you so you won't get in trouble." §15 So the guards accepted the bribe and said what they were told to say. Their story spread widely among the Jews, and they still tell it today. §[The Great Commission] 16 Then the eleven disciples left for Galilee, going to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go. §17 When they saw him, they worshiped him-but some of them doubted!§18 Jesus came and told his disciples, "I have been given all authority in heaven and on earth.  §19 Therefore, go and make disciples of all the nations,* baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.  §20 Teach these new disciples to obey all the commands I have given you. And be sure of this: I am with you always, even to the end of the age."        §§Footnotes:§ 28:1 Greek After the Sabbath, on the first day of the week.  § 28:19 Or all peoples.  §
NLT/Matthew 3	[John the Baptist Prepares the Way] 1 In those days John the Baptist came to the Judean wilderness and began preaching. His message was, §2 "Repent of your sins and turn to God, for the Kingdom of Heaven is near.*" §3 The prophet Isaiah was speaking about John when he said, "He is a voice shouting in the wilderness, "Prepare the way for the Lord 's coming! Clear the road for him!'"*John's clothes were woven from coarse camel hair, and he wore a leather belt around his waist. For food he ate locusts and wild honey. §5 People from Jerusalem and from all of Judea and all over the Jordan Valley went out to see and hear John. §6 And when they confessed their sins, he baptized them in the Jordan River.§7 But when he saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to watch him baptize,* he denounced them. "You brood of snakes!" he exclaimed. "Who warned you to flee the coming wrath? §8 Prove by the way you live that you have repented of your sins and turned to God. §9 Don't just say to each other, "We're safe, for we are descendants of Abraham.' That means nothing, for I tell you, God can create children of Abraham from these very stones. §10 Even now the ax of God's judgment is poised, ready to sever the roots of the trees. Yes, every tree that does not produce good fruit will be chopped down and thrown into the fire.§11 "I baptize with* water those who repent of their sins and turn to God. But someone is coming soon who is greater than I am-so much greater that I'm not worthy even to be his slave and carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.* §12 He is ready to separate the chaff from the wheat with his winnowing fork. Then he will clean up the threshing area, gathering the wheat into his barn but burning the chaff with never-ending fire." §[The Baptism of Jesus] 13 Then Jesus went from Galilee to the Jordan River to be baptized by John. §14 But John tried to talk him out of it. "I am the one who needs to be baptized by you," he said, "so why are you coming to me?"§15 But Jesus said, "It should be done, for we must carry out all that God requires.*"  So John agreed to baptize him.§16 After his baptism, as Jesus came up out of the water, the heavens were opened* and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and settling on him. §17 And a voice from heaven said, "This is my dearly loved Son, who brings me great joy."       §§Footnotes:§ 3:2 Or has come, or is coming soon.  § 3:3 Isa 40:3 (Greek version). 4 § 3:7 Or coming to be baptized.  § 3:11a Or in.  § 3:11b Or in the Holy Spirit and in fire.  § 3:15 Or for we must fulfill all righteousness.  § 3:16 Some manuscripts read opened to him.  §
NLT/Matthew 4	[The Temptation of Jesus] 1 Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted there by the devil. §2 For forty days and forty nights he fasted and became very hungry.§3 During that time the devil* came and said to him, "If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become loaves of bread."§4 But Jesus told him, "No! The Scriptures say,  "People do not live by bread alone,  but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.'*" 5 Then the devil took him to the holy city, Jerusalem, to the highest point of the Temple, §6 and said, "If you are the Son of God, jump off! For the Scriptures say, "He will order his angels to protect you. And they will hold you up with their hands so you won't even hurt your foot on a stone.'*"§7 Jesus responded, "The Scriptures also say, "You must not test the  Lord  your God.'*" 8 Next the devil took him to the peak of a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory. §9 "I will give it all to you," he said, "if you will kneel down and worship me."§10 "Get out of here, Satan,"  Jesus told him. "For the Scriptures say,  "You must worship the  Lord  your God  and serve only him.'*" 11 Then the devil went away, and angels came and took care of Jesus. §[The Ministry of Jesus Begins] 12 When Jesus heard that John had been arrested, he left Judea and returned to Galilee. §13 He went first to Nazareth, then left there and moved to Capernaum, beside the Sea of Galilee, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali. §14 This fulfilled what God said through the prophet Isaiah:§15 "In the land of Zebulun and of Naphtali, beside the sea, beyond the Jordan River, in Galilee where so many Gentiles live,§16 the people who sat in darkness have seen a great light. And for those who lived in the land where death casts its shadow, a light has shined."*From then on Jesus began to preach, "Repent of your sins and turn to God, for the Kingdom of Heaven is near.*"  §[The First Disciples] 18 One day as Jesus was walking along the shore of the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers-Simon, also called Peter, and Andrew-throwing a net into the water, for they fished for a living. §19 Jesus called out to them, "Come, follow me, and I will show you how to fish for people!"  §20 And they left their nets at once and followed him.§21 A little farther up the shore he saw two other brothers, James and John, sitting in a boat with their father, Zebedee, repairing their nets. And he called them to come, too. §22 They immediately followed him, leaving the boat and their father behind. §[Crowds Follow Jesus] 23 Jesus traveled throughout the region of Galilee, teaching in the synagogues and announcing the Good News about the Kingdom. And he healed every kind of disease and illness. §24 News about him spread as far as Syria, and people soon began bringing to him all who were sick. And whatever their sickness or disease, or if they were demon possessed or epileptic or paralyzed-he healed them all. §25 Large crowds followed him wherever he went-people from Galilee, the Ten Towns,* Jerusalem, from all over Judea, and from east of the Jordan River.       §§Footnotes:§ 4:3 Greek the tempter.  § 4:4 Deut 8:3.  § 4:6 Ps 91:11-12.  § 4:7 Deut 6:16.  § 4:10 Deut 6:13.  § 4:15-16 Isa 9:1-2 (Greek version). 17 § 4:17 Or has come, or is coming soon.  § 4:25 Greek Decapolis.  §
NLT/Matthew 5	[The Sermon on the Mount] 1 One day as he saw the crowds gathering, Jesus went up on the mountainside and sat down. His disciples gathered around him, §2 and he began to teach them. §[The Beatitudes] 3 "God blesses those who are poor and realize their need for him,*for the Kingdom of Heaven is theirs. 4 God blesses those who mourn,  for they will be comforted. 5 God blesses those who are humble,  for they will inherit the whole earth. 6 God blesses those who hunger and thirst for justice,*for they will be satisfied. 7 God blesses those who are merciful,  for they will be shown mercy. 8 God blesses those whose hearts are pure,  for they will see God. 9 God blesses those who work for peace,  for they will be called the children of God. 10 God blesses those who are persecuted for doing right,  for the Kingdom of Heaven is theirs. 11 "God blesses you when people mock you and persecute you and lie about you and say all sorts of evil things against you because you are my followers.  §12 Be happy about it! Be very glad! For a great reward awaits you in heaven. And remember, the ancient prophets were persecuted in the same way.  §[Teaching about Salt and Light] 13 "You are the salt of the earth. But what good is salt if it has lost its flavor? Can you make it salty again? It will be thrown out and trampled underfoot as worthless. 14 "You are the light of the world-like a city on a hilltop that cannot be hidden.  §15 No one lights a lamp and then puts it under a basket. Instead, a lamp is placed on a stand, where it gives light to everyone in the house.  §16 In the same way, let your good deeds shine out for all to see, so that everyone will praise your heavenly Father.  §[Teaching about the Law] 17 "Don't misunderstand why I have come. I did not come to abolish the law of Moses or the writings of the prophets. No, I came to accomplish their purpose.  §18 I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not even the smallest detail of God's law will disappear until its purpose is achieved.  §19 So if you ignore the least commandment and teach others to do the same, you will be called the least in the Kingdom of Heaven. But anyone who obeys God's laws and teaches them will be called great in the Kingdom of Heaven. 20 "But I warn you-unless your righteousness is better than the righteousness of the teachers of religious law and the Pharisees, you will never enter the Kingdom of Heaven!  §[Teaching about Anger] 21 "You have heard that our ancestors were told, "You must not murder. If you commit murder, you are subject to judgment.'* §22 But I say, if you are even angry with someone,* you are subject to judgment! If you call someone an idiot,* you are in danger of being brought before the court. And if you curse someone,* you are in danger of the fires of hell.*"So if you are presenting a sacrifice* at the altar in the Temple and you suddenly remember that someone has something against you,  §24 leave your sacrifice there at the altar. Go and be reconciled to that person. Then come and offer your sacrifice to God. 25 "When you are on the way to court with your adversary, settle your differences quickly. Otherwise, your accuser may hand you over to the judge, who will hand you over to an officer, and you will be thrown into prison.  §26 And if that happens, you surely won't be free again until you have paid the last penny.*"You have heard the commandment that says, "You must not commit adultery.'* §28 But I say, anyone who even looks at a woman with lust has already committed adultery with her in his heart.  §29 So if your eye-even your good eye*-causes you to lust, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.  §30 And if your hand-even your stronger hand*-causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.  §[Teaching about Divorce] 31 "You have heard the law that says, "A man can divorce his wife by merely giving her a written notice of divorce.'* §32 But I say that a man who divorces his wife, unless she has been unfaithful, causes her to commit adultery. And anyone who marries a divorced woman also commits adultery.  §[Teaching about Vows] 33 "You have also heard that our ancestors were told, "You must not break your vows; you must carry out the vows you make to the  Lord  .'* §34 But I say, do not make any vows! Do not say, "By heaven!' because heaven is God's throne.  §35 And do not say, "By the earth!' because the earth is his footstool. And do not say, "By Jerusalem!' for Jerusalem is the city of the great King.  §36 Do not even say, "By my head!' for you can't turn one hair white or black.  §37 Just say a simple, "Yes, I will,' or "No, I won't.' Anything beyond this is from the evil one.  §[Teaching about Revenge] 38 "You have heard the law that says the punishment must match the injury: "An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.'* §39 But I say, do not resist an evil person! If someone slaps you on the right cheek, offer the other cheek also.  §40 If you are sued in court and your shirt is taken from you, give your coat, too.  §41 If a soldier demands that you carry his gear for a mile,* carry it two miles.  §42 Give to those who ask, and don't turn away from those who want to borrow.  §[Teaching about Love for Enemies] 43 "You have heard the law that says, "Love your neighbor'* and hate your enemy.  §44 But I say, love your enemies!* Pray for those who persecute you!  §45 In that way, you will be acting as true children of your Father in heaven. For he gives his sunlight to both the evil and the good, and he sends rain on the just and the unjust alike.  §46 If you love only those who love you, what reward is there for that? Even corrupt tax collectors do that much.  §47 If you are kind only to your friends,* how are you different from anyone else? Even pagans do that.  §48 But you are to be perfect, even as your Father in heaven is perfect.        §§Footnotes:§ 5:3 Greek poor in spirit.   § 5:6 Or for righteousness.   § 5:21 Exod 20:13; Deut 5:17.  § 5:22a Some manuscripts add without cause.  § 5:22b Greek uses an Aramaic term of contempt: If you say to your brother, "Raca.'  § 5:22c Greek if you say, "You fool.'  § 5:22d Greek Gehenna; also in 5:29, 30.  23 § 5:23 Greek gift; also in 5:24.  § 5:26 Greek the last kodrantes [i.e., quadrans].   §[Teaching about Adultery] 27 § 5:27 Exod 20:14; Deut 5:18.  § 5:29 Greek your right eye.  § 5:30 Greek your right hand.  § 5:31 Deut 24:1.  § 5:33 Num 30:2.  § 5:38 Greek the law that says: "An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.'

NLT/Matthew 6	[Teaching about Giving to the Needy] 1 "Watch out! Don't do your good deeds publicly, to be admired by others, for you will lose the reward from your Father in heaven.  §2 When you give to someone in need, don't do as the hypocrites do-blowing trumpets in the synagogues and streets to call attention to their acts of charity! I tell you the truth, they have received all the reward they will ever get.  §3 But when you give to someone in need, don't let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.  §4 Give your gifts in private, and your Father, who sees everything, will reward you.  §[Teaching about Prayer and Fasting] 5 "When you pray, don't be like the hypocrites who love to pray publicly on street corners and in the synagogues where everyone can see them. I tell you the truth, that is all the reward they will ever get.  §6 But when you pray, go away by yourself, shut the door behind you, and pray to your Father in private. Then your Father, who sees everything, will reward you. 7 "When you pray, don't babble on and on as the Gentiles do. They think their prayers are answered merely by repeating their words again and again.  §8 Don't be like them, for your Father knows exactly what you need even before you ask him!  §9 Pray like this:  Our Father in heaven,  may your name be kept holy. 10 May your Kingdom come soon.  May your will be done on earth,  as it is in heaven. 11 Give us today the food we need,*and forgive us our sins,  as we have forgiven those who sin against us. 13 And don't let us yield to temptation,*but rescue us from the evil one.*"If you forgive those who sin against you, your heavenly Father will forgive you.  §15 But if you refuse to forgive others, your Father will not forgive your sins. 16 "And when you fast, don't make it obvious, as the hypocrites do, for they try to look miserable and disheveled so people will admire them for their fasting. I tell you the truth, that is the only reward they will ever get.  §17 But when you fast, comb your hair* and wash your face.  §18 Then no one will notice that you are fasting, except your Father, who knows what you do in private. And your Father, who sees everything, will reward you.  §[Teaching about Money and Possessions] 19 "Don't store up treasures here on earth, where moths eat them and rust destroys them, and where thieves break in and steal.  §20 Store your treasures in heaven, where moths and rust cannot destroy, and thieves do not break in and steal.  §21 Wherever your treasure is, there the desires of your heart will also be. 22 "Your eye is like a lamp that provides light for your body. When your eye is healthy, your whole body is filled with light.  §23 But when your eye is unhealthy, your whole body is filled with darkness. And if the light you think you have is actually darkness, how deep that darkness is! 24 "No one can serve two masters. For you will hate one and love the other; you will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and be enslaved to money. 25 "That is why I tell you not to worry about everyday life-whether you have enough food and drink, or enough clothes to wear. Isn't life more than food, and your body more than clothing?  §26 Look at the birds. They don't plant or harvest or store food in barns, for your heavenly Father feeds them. And aren't you far more valuable to him than they are?  §27 Can all your worries add a single moment to your life? 28 "And why worry about your clothing? Look at the lilies of the field and how they grow. They don't work or make their clothing,  §29 yet Solomon in all his glory was not dressed as beautifully as they are.  §30 And if God cares so wonderfully for wildflowers that are here today and thrown into the fire tomorrow, he will certainly care for you. Why do you have so little faith? 31 "So don't worry about these things, saying, "What will we eat? What will we drink? What will we wear?'  §32 These things dominate the thoughts of unbelievers, but your heavenly Father already knows all your needs.  §33 Seek the Kingdom of God* above all else, and live righteously, and he will give you everything you need. §34 "So don't worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will bring its own worries. Today's trouble is enough for today.        §§Footnotes:§ 6:11 Or Give us today our food for the day; or Give us today our food for tomorrow.  12 § 6:13a Or And keep us from being tested.   § 6:13b Or from evil.

NLT/Matthew 7	[Do Not Judge Others] 1 "Do not judge others, and you will not be judged.  §2 For you will be treated as you treat others.* The standard you use in judging is the standard by which you will be judged.*"And why worry about a speck in your friend's eye* when you have a log in your own?  §4 How can you think of saying to your friend,* "Let me help you get rid of that speck in your eye,' when you can't see past the log in your own eye?  §5 Hypocrite! First get rid of the log in your own eye; then you will see well enough to deal with the speck in your friend's eye. 6 "Don't waste what is holy on people who are unholy.* Don't throw your pearls to pigs! They will trample the pearls, then turn and attack you.  §[Effective Prayer] 7 "Keep on asking, and you will receive what you ask for. Keep on seeking, and you will find. Keep on knocking, and the door will be opened to you.  §8 For everyone who asks, receives. Everyone who seeks, finds. And to everyone who knocks, the door will be opened. 9 "You parents-if your children ask for a loaf of bread, do you give them a stone instead?  §10 Or if they ask for a fish, do you give them a snake? Of course not!  §11 So if you sinful people know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give good gifts to those who ask him.  §[The Golden Rule] 12 "Do to others whatever you would like them to do to you. This is the essence of all that is taught in the law and the prophets.  §[The Narrow Gate] 13 "You can enter God's Kingdom only through the narrow gate. The highway to hell* is broad, and its gate is wide for the many who choose that way.  §14 But the gateway to life is very narrow and the road is difficult, and only a few ever find it.  §[The Tree and Its Fruit] 15 "Beware of false prophets who come disguised as harmless sheep but are really vicious wolves.  §16 You can identify them by their fruit, that is, by the way they act. Can you pick grapes from thornbushes, or figs from thistles?  §17 A good tree produces good fruit, and a bad tree produces bad fruit.  §18 A good tree can't produce bad fruit, and a bad tree can't produce good fruit.  §19 So every tree that does not produce good fruit is chopped down and thrown into the fire.  §20 Yes, just as you can identify a tree by its fruit, so you can identify people by their actions.  §[True Disciples] 21 "Not everyone who calls out to me, "Lord! Lord!' will enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Only those who actually do the will of my Father in heaven will enter.  §22 On judgment day many will say to me, "Lord! Lord! We prophesied in your name and cast out demons in your name and performed many miracles in your name.'  §23 But I will reply, "I never knew you. Get away from me, you who break God's laws.'  §[Building on a Solid Foundation] 24 "Anyone who listens to my teaching and follows it is wise, like a person who builds a house on solid rock.  §25 Though the rain comes in torrents and the floodwaters rise and the winds beat against that house, it won't collapse because it is built on bedrock.  §26 But anyone who hears my teaching and doesn't obey it is foolish, like a person who builds a house on sand.  §27 When the rains and floods come and the winds beat against that house, it will collapse with a mighty crash." 28 When Jesus had finished saying these things, the crowds were amazed at his teaching, §29 for he taught with real authority-quite unlike their teachers of religious law.       §§Footnotes:§ 7:2a Or For God will judge you as you judge others.  § 7:2b Or The measure you give will be the measure you get back.  3 § 7:3 Greek your brother's eye; also in 7:5.  § 7:4 Greek your brother.  § 7:6 Greek Don't give the sacred to dogs.  § 7:13 Greek The road that leads to destruction.  §
NLT/Matthew 8	[Jesus Heals a Man with Leprosy] 1 Large crowds followed Jesus as he came down the mountainside. §2 Suddenly, a man with leprosy approached him and knelt before him. "Lord," the man said, "if you are willing, you can heal me and make me clean."§3 Jesus reached out and touched him. "I am willing,"  he said. "Be healed!"  And instantly the leprosy disappeared. §4 Then Jesus said to him, "Don't tell anyone about this. Instead, go to the priest and let him examine you. Take along the offering required in the law of Moses for those who have been healed of leprosy.* This will be a public testimony that you have been cleansed."  §[The Faith of a Roman Officer] 5 When Jesus returned to Capernaum, a Roman officer* came and pleaded with him, §6 "Lord, my young servant* lies in bed, paralyzed and in terrible pain."§7 Jesus said, "I will come and heal him." 8 But the officer said, "Lord, I am not worthy to have you come into my home. Just say the word from where you are, and my servant will be healed. §9 I know this because I am under the authority of my superior officers, and I have authority over my soldiers. I only need to say, "Go,' and they go, or "Come,' and they come. And if I say to my slaves, "Do this,' they do it."§10 When Jesus heard this, he was amazed. Turning to those who were following him, he said, "I tell you the truth, I haven't seen faith like this in all Israel!  §11 And I tell you this, that many Gentiles will come from all over the world-from east and west-and sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob at the feast in the Kingdom of Heaven.  §12 But many Israelites-those for whom the Kingdom was prepared-will be thrown into outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth." 13 Then Jesus said to the Roman officer, "Go back home. Because you believed, it has happened."  And the young servant was healed that same hour. §[Jesus Heals Many People] 14 When Jesus arrived at Peter's house, Peter's mother-in-law was sick in bed with a high fever. §15 But when Jesus touched her hand, the fever left her. Then she got up and prepared a meal for him.§16 That evening many demon-possessed people were brought to Jesus. He cast out the evil spirits with a simple command, and he healed all the sick. §17 This fulfilled the word of the Lord through the prophet Isaiah, who said, "He took our sicknesses and removed our diseases."*When Jesus saw the crowd around him, he instructed his disciples to cross to the other side of the lake.§19 Then one of the teachers of religious law said to him, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."§20 But Jesus replied, "Foxes have dens to live in, and birds have nests, but the Son of Man* has no place even to lay his head." 21 Another of his disciples said, "Lord, first let me return home and bury my father."§22 But Jesus told him, "Follow me now. Let the spiritually dead bury their own dead.*"  §[Jesus Calms the Storm] 23 Then Jesus got into the boat and started across the lake with his disciples. §24 Suddenly, a fierce storm struck the lake, with waves breaking into the boat. But Jesus was sleeping. §25 The disciples went and woke him up, shouting, "Lord, save us! We're going to drown!"§26 Jesus responded, "Why are you afraid? You have so little faith!"  Then he got up and rebuked the wind and waves, and suddenly there was a great calm.§27 The disciples were amazed. "Who is this man?" they asked. "Even the winds and waves obey him!" §[Jesus Heals Two Demon-Possessed Men] 28 When Jesus arrived on the other side of the lake, in the region of the Gadarenes,* two men who were possessed by demons met him. They came out of the tombs and were so violent that no one could go through that area.§29 They began screaming at him, "Why are you interfering with us, Son of God? Have you come here to torture us before God's appointed time?"§30 There happened to be a large herd of pigs feeding in the distance. §31 So the demons begged, "If you cast us out, send us into that herd of pigs."§32 "All right, go!"  Jesus commanded them. So the demons came out of the men and entered the pigs, and the whole herd plunged down the steep hillside into the lake and drowned in the water.§33 The herdsmen fled to the nearby town, telling everyone what happened to the demon-possessed men. §34 Then the entire town came out to meet Jesus, but they begged him to go away and leave them alone.       §§Footnotes:§ 8:4 See Lev 14:2-32.  § 8:5 Greek a centurion; similarly in 8:8, 13.  § 8:6 Or child; also in 8:13.  § 8:17 Isa 53:4.  §[The Cost of Following Jesus] 18 § 8:20 "Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself.  § 8:22 Greek Let the dead bury their own dead.  § 8:28 Other manuscripts read Gerasenes; still others read Gergesenes. Compare Mark 5:1; Luke 8:26.  §
NLT/Matthew 9	[Jesus Heals a Paralyzed Man] 1 Jesus climbed into a boat and went back across the lake to his own town. §2 Some people brought to him a paralyzed man on a mat. Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralyzed man, "Be encouraged, my child! Your sins are forgiven." 3 But some of the teachers of religious law said to themselves, "That's blasphemy! Does he think he's God?"§4 Jesus knew* what they were thinking, so he asked them, "Why do you have such evil thoughts in your hearts?  §5 Is it easier to say "Your sins are forgiven,' or "Stand up and walk'?  §6 So I will prove to you that the Son of Man* has the authority on earth to forgive sins."  Then Jesus turned to the paralyzed man and said, "Stand up, pick up your mat, and go home!" 7 And the man jumped up and went home! §8 Fear swept through the crowd as they saw this happen. And they praised God for giving humans such authority. §[Jesus Calls Matthew] 9 As Jesus was walking along, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at his tax collector's booth. "Follow me and be my disciple,"  Jesus said to him. So Matthew got up and followed him.§10 Later, Matthew invited Jesus and his disciples to his home as dinner guests, along with many tax collectors and other disreputable sinners. §11 But when the Pharisees saw this, they asked his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with such scum?*"§12 When Jesus heard this, he said, "Healthy people don't need a doctor-sick people do."  §13 Then he added, "Now go and learn the meaning of this Scripture: "I want you to show mercy, not offer sacrifices.'* For I have come to call not those who think they are righteous, but those who know they are sinners."  §[A Discussion about Fasting] 14 One day the disciples of John the Baptist came to Jesus and asked him, "Why don't your disciples fast* like we do and the Pharisees do?"§15 Jesus replied, "Do wedding guests mourn while celebrating with the groom? Of course not. But someday the groom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast. 16 "Besides, who would patch old clothing with new cloth? For the new patch would shrink and rip away from the old cloth, leaving an even bigger tear than before. 17 "And no one puts new wine into old wineskins. For the old skins would burst from the pressure, spilling the wine and ruining the skins. New wine is stored in new wineskins so that both are preserved."  §[Jesus Heals in Response to Faith] 18 As Jesus was saying this, the leader of a synagogue came and knelt before him. "My daughter has just died," he said, "but you can bring her back to life again if you just come and lay your hand on her."§19 So Jesus and his disciples got up and went with him. §20 Just then a woman who had suffered for twelve years with constant bleeding came up behind him. She touched the fringe of his robe, §21 for she thought, "If I can just touch his robe, I will be healed."§22 Jesus turned around, and when he saw her he said, "Daughter, be encouraged! Your faith has made you well."  And the woman was healed at that moment.§23 When Jesus arrived at the official's home, he saw the noisy crowd and heard the funeral music. §24 "Get out!"  he told them. "The girl isn't dead; she's only asleep."  But the crowd laughed at him. §25 After the crowd was put outside, however, Jesus went in and took the girl by the hand, and she stood up! §26 The report of this miracle swept through the entire countryside. §[Jesus Heals the Blind] 27 After Jesus left the girl's home, two blind men followed along behind him, shouting, "Son of David, have mercy on us!"§28 They went right into the house where he was staying, and Jesus asked them, "Do you believe I can make you see?"  "Yes, Lord," they told him, "we do."§29 Then he touched their eyes and said, "Because of your faith, it will happen."  §30 Then their eyes were opened, and they could see! Jesus sternly warned them, "Don't tell anyone about this."  §31 But instead, they went out and spread his fame all over the region.§32 When they left, a demon-possessed man who couldn't speak was brought to Jesus. §33 So Jesus cast out the demon, and then the man began to speak. The crowds were amazed. "Nothing like this has ever happened in Israel!" they exclaimed.§34 But the Pharisees said, "He can cast out demons because he is empowered by the prince of demons." §[The Need for Workers] 35 Jesus traveled through all the towns and villages of that area, teaching in the synagogues and announcing the Good News about the Kingdom. And he healed every kind of disease and illness. §36 When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them because they were confused and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd. §37 He said to his disciples, "The harvest is great, but the workers are few.  §38 So pray to the Lord who is in charge of the harvest; ask him to send more workers into his fields."        §§Footnotes:§ 9:4 Some manuscripts read saw.  § 9:6 "Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself.  § 9:11 Greek with tax collectors and sinners?  § 9:13 Hos 6:6 (Greek version).  § 9:14 Some manuscripts read fast often.  §
NLT/Mark 1	[John the Baptist Prepares the Way] 1 This is the Good News about Jesus the Messiah, the Son of God.* It began §2 just as the prophet Isaiah had written: "Look, I am sending my messenger ahead of you, and he will prepare your way.*He is a voice shouting in the wilderness, "Prepare the way for the Lord 's coming! Clear the road for him!'*"§4 This messenger was John the Baptist. He was in the wilderness and preached that people should be baptized to show that they had repented of their sins and turned to God to be forgiven. §5 All of Judea, including all the people of Jerusalem, went out to see and hear John. And when they confessed their sins, he baptized them in the Jordan River. §6 His clothes were woven from coarse camel hair, and he wore a leather belt around his waist. For food he ate locusts and wild honey.§7 John announced: "Someone is coming soon who is greater than I am-so much greater that I'm not even worthy to stoop down like a slave and untie the straps of his sandals. §8 I baptize you with* water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit!" §[The Baptism and Temptation of Jesus] 9 One day Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee, and John baptized him in the Jordan River. §10 As Jesus came up out of the water, he saw the heavens splitting apart and the Holy Spirit descending on him* like a dove. §11 And a voice from heaven said, "You are my dearly loved Son, and you bring me great joy."§12 The Spirit then compelled Jesus to go into the wilderness, §13 where he was tempted by Satan for forty days. He was out among the wild animals, and angels took care of him.§14 Later on, after John was arrested, Jesus went into Galilee, where he preached God's Good News.* §15 "The time promised by God has come at last!"  he announced. "The Kingdom of God is near! Repent of your sins and believe the Good News!"  §[The First Disciples] 16 One day as Jesus was walking along the shore of the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon* and his brother Andrew throwing a net into the water, for they fished for a living. §17 Jesus called out to them, "Come, follow me, and I will show you how to fish for people!"  §18 And they left their nets at once and followed him.§19 A little farther up the shore Jesus saw Zebedee's sons, James and John, in a boat repairing their nets. §20 He called them at once, and they also followed him, leaving their father, Zebedee, in the boat with the hired men. §[Jesus Casts Out an Evil Spirit] 21 Jesus and his companions went to the town of Capernaum. When the Sabbath day came, he went into the synagogue and began to teach. §22 The people were amazed at his teaching, for he taught with real authority-quite unlike the teachers of religious law.§23 Suddenly, a man in the synagogue who was possessed by an evil* spirit cried out, §24 "Why are you interfering with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are-the Holy One of God!"§25 But Jesus reprimanded him. "Be quiet! Come out of the man,"  he ordered. §26 At that, the evil spirit screamed, threw the man into a convulsion, and then came out of him.§27 Amazement gripped the audience, and they began to discuss what had happened. "What sort of new teaching is this?" they asked excitedly. "It has such authority! Even evil spirits obey his orders!" §28 The news about Jesus spread quickly throughout the entire region of Galilee. §[Jesus Heals Many People] 29 After Jesus left the synagogue with James and John, they went to Simon and Andrew's home. §30 Now Simon's mother-in-law was sick in bed with a high fever. They told Jesus about her right away. §31 So he went to her bedside, took her by the hand, and helped her sit up. Then the fever left her, and she prepared a meal for them.§32 That evening after sunset, many sick and demon-possessed people were brought to Jesus. §33 The whole town gathered at the door to watch. §34 So Jesus healed many people who were sick with various diseases, and he cast out many demons. But because the demons knew who he was, he did not allow them to speak. §[Jesus Preaches in Galilee] 35 Before daybreak the next morning, Jesus got up and went out to an isolated place to pray. §36 Later Simon and the others went out to find him. §37 When they found him, they said, "Everyone is looking for you."§38 But Jesus replied, "We must go on to other towns as well, and I will preach to them, too. That is why I came."  §39 So he traveled throughout the region of Galilee, preaching in the synagogues and casting out demons. §[Jesus Heals a Man with Leprosy] 40 A man with leprosy came and knelt in front of Jesus, begging to be healed. "If you are willing, you can heal me and make me clean," he said.§41 Moved with compassion,* Jesus reached out and touched him. "I am willing,"  he said. "Be healed!"  §42 Instantly the leprosy disappeared, and the man was healed. §43 Then Jesus sent him on his way with a stern warning: §44 "Don't tell anyone about this. Instead, go to the priest and let him examine you. Take along the offering required in the law of Moses for those who have been healed of leprosy.* This will be a public testimony that you have been cleansed." §45 But the man went and spread the word, proclaiming to everyone what had happened. As a result, large crowds soon surrounded Jesus, and he couldn't publicly enter a town anywhere. He had to stay out in the secluded places, but people from everywhere kept coming to him.       §§Footnotes:§ 1:1 Some manuscripts do not include the Son of God.  § 1:2 Mal 3:1. 3 § 1:3 Isa 40:3 (Greek version).  § 1:8 Or in; also in 1:8b.  § 1:10 Or toward him, or into him.  § 1:14 Some manuscripts read the Good News of the Kingdom of God.  § 1:16 Simon is called "Peter" in 3:16 and thereafter.  § 1:23 Greek unclean; also in 1:26, 27.  § 1:41 Some manuscripts read Moved with anger.  § 1:44 See Lev 14:2-32.  §
NLT/Mark 10	[Discussion about Divorce and Marriage] 1 Then Jesus left Capernaum and went down to the region of Judea and into the area east of the Jordan River. Once again crowds gathered around him, and as usual he was teaching them.§2 Some Pharisees came and tried to trap him with this question: "Should a man be allowed to divorce his wife?"§3 Jesus answered them with a question: "What did Moses say in the law about divorce?" 4 "Well, he permitted it," they replied. "He said a man can give his wife a written notice of divorce and send her away."*But Jesus responded, "He wrote this commandment only as a concession to your hard hearts.  §6 But "God made them male and female'* from the beginning of creation.  §7 "This explains why a man leaves his father and mother and is joined to his wife,* §8 and the two are united into one.'* Since they are no longer two but one,  §9 let no one split apart what God has joined together." 10 Later, when he was alone with his disciples in the house, they brought up the subject again. §11 He told them, "Whoever divorces his wife and marries someone else commits adultery against her.  §12 And if a woman divorces her husband and marries someone else, she commits adultery."  §[Jesus Blesses the Children] 13 One day some parents brought their children to Jesus so he could touch and bless them. But the disciples scolded the parents for bothering him.§14 When Jesus saw what was happening, he was angry with his disciples. He said to them, "Let the children come to me. Don't stop them! For the Kingdom of God belongs to those who are like these children.  §15 I tell you the truth, anyone who doesn't receive the Kingdom of God like a child will never enter it."  §16 Then he took the children in his arms and placed his hands on their heads and blessed them. §[The Rich Man] 17 As Jesus was starting out on his way to Jerusalem, a man came running up to him, knelt down, and asked, "Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"§18 "Why do you call me good?"  Jesus asked. "Only God is truly good.  §19 But to answer your question, you know the commandments: "You must not murder. You must not commit adultery. You must not steal. You must not testify falsely. You must not cheat anyone. Honor your father and mother.'*" 20 "Teacher," the man replied, "I've obeyed all these commandments since I was young."§21 Looking at the man, Jesus felt genuine love for him. "There is still one thing you haven't done,"  he told him. "Go and sell all your possessions and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me." 22 At this the man's face fell, and he went away sad, for he had many possessions.§23 Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, "How hard it is for the rich to enter the Kingdom of God!"  §24 This amazed them. But Jesus said again, "Dear children, it is very hard* to enter the Kingdom of God.  §25 In fact, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the Kingdom of God!" 26 The disciples were astounded. "Then who in the world can be saved?" they asked.§27 Jesus looked at them intently and said, "Humanly speaking, it is impossible. But not with God. Everything is possible with God." 28 Then Peter began to speak up. "We've given up everything to follow you," he said.§29 "Yes,"  Jesus replied, "and I assure you that everyone who has given up house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or property, for my sake and for the Good News,  §30 will receive now in return a hundred times as many houses, brothers, sisters, mothers, children, and property-along with persecution. And in the world to come that person will have eternal life.  §31 But many who are the greatest now will be least important then, and those who seem least important now will be the greatest then.*"  §[Jesus Again Predicts His Death] 32 They were now on the way up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was walking ahead of them. The disciples were filled with awe, and the people following behind were overwhelmed with fear. Taking the twelve disciples aside, Jesus once more began to describe everything that was about to happen to him. §33 "Listen,"  he said, "we're going up to Jerusalem, where the Son of Man* will be betrayed to the leading priests and the teachers of religious law. They will sentence him to die and hand him over to the Romans.* §34 They will mock him, spit on him, flog him with a whip, and kill him, but after three days he will rise again."  §[Jesus Teaches about Serving Others] 35 Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came over and spoke to him. "Teacher," they said, "we want you to do us a favor."§36 "What is your request?"  he asked.§37 They replied, "When you sit on your glorious throne, we want to sit in places of honor next to you, one on your right and the other on your left."§38 But Jesus said to them, "You don't know what you are asking! Are you able to drink from the bitter cup of suffering I am about to drink? Are you able to be baptized with the baptism of suffering I must be baptized with?" 39 "Oh yes," they replied, "we are able!" Then Jesus told them, "You will indeed drink from my bitter cup and be baptized with my baptism of suffering.  §40 But I have no right to say who will sit on my right or my left. God has prepared those places for the ones he has chosen." 41 When the ten other disciples heard what James and John had asked, they were indignant. §42 So Jesus called them together and said, "You know that the rulers in this world lord it over their people, and officials flaunt their authority over those under them.  §43 But among you it will be different. Whoever wants to be a leader among you must be your servant,  §44 and whoever wants to be first among you must be the slave of everyone else.  §45 For even the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve others and to give his life as a ransom for many."  §[Jesus Heals Blind Bartimaeus] 46 Then they reached Jericho, and as Jesus and his disciples left town, a large crowd followed him. A blind beggar named Bartimaeus (son of Timaeus) was sitting beside the road. §47 When Bartimaeus heard that Jesus of Nazareth was nearby, he began to shout, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!"§48 "Be quiet!" many of the people yelled at him. But he only shouted louder, "Son of David, have mercy on me!"§49 When Jesus heard him, he stopped and said, "Tell him to come here."  So they called the blind man. "Cheer up," they said. "Come on, he's calling you!" §50 Bartimaeus threw aside his coat, jumped up, and came to Jesus.§51 "What do you want me to do for you?"  Jesus asked. "My Rabbi,*" the blind man said, "I want to see!"§52 And Jesus said to him, "Go, for your faith has healed you."  Instantly the man could see, and he followed Jesus down the road.*§§Footnotes:§ 10:4 See Deut 24:1. 5 § 10:6 Gen 1:27; 5:2.  § 10:7 Some manuscripts do not include and is joined to his wife.  § 10:7-8 Gen 2:24.  § 10:19 Exod 20:12-16; Deut 5:16-20.  § 10:24 Some manuscripts read very hard for those who trust in riches.  § 10:31 Greek But many who are first will be last; and the last, first.  § 10:33a "Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself.  § 10:33b Greek the Gentiles.  § 10:51 Greek uses the Hebrew term Rabboni.  § 10:52 Or on the way.        §
NLT/Mark 11	[Jesus' Triumphant Entry] 1 As Jesus and his disciples approached Jerusalem, they came to the towns of Bethphage and Bethany on the Mount of Olives. Jesus sent two of them on ahead. §2 "Go into that village over there,"  he told them. "As soon as you enter it, you will see a young donkey tied there that no one has ever ridden. Untie it and bring it here.  §3 If anyone asks, "What are you doing?' just say, "The Lord needs it and will return it soon.'" 4 The two disciples left and found the colt standing in the street, tied outside the front door. §5 As they were untying it, some bystanders demanded, "What are you doing, untying that colt?" §6 They said what Jesus had told them to say, and they were permitted to take it. §7 Then they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their garments over it, and he sat on it.§8 Many in the crowd spread their garments on the road ahead of him, and others spread leafy branches they had cut in the fields. §9 Jesus was in the center of the procession, and the people all around him were shouting, "Praise God!*Blessings on the one who comes in the name of the Lord !§10 Blessings on the coming Kingdom of our ancestor David! Praise God in highest heaven!"*So Jesus came to Jerusalem and went into the Temple. After looking around carefully at everything, he left because it was late in the afternoon. Then he returned to Bethany with the twelve disciples. §[Jesus Curses the Fig Tree] 12 The next morning as they were leaving Bethany, Jesus was hungry. §13 He noticed a fig tree in full leaf a little way off, so he went over to see if he could find any figs. But there were only leaves because it was too early in the season for fruit. §14 Then Jesus said to the tree, "May no one ever eat your fruit again!"  And the disciples heard him say it. §[Jesus Clears the Temple] 15 When they arrived back in Jerusalem, Jesus entered the Temple and began to drive out the people buying and selling animals for sacrifices. He knocked over the tables of the money changers and the chairs of those selling doves, §16 and he stopped everyone from using the Temple as a marketplace.* §17 He said to them, "The Scriptures declare, "My Temple will be called a house of prayer for all nations,' but you have turned it into a den of thieves."*When the leading priests and teachers of religious law heard what Jesus had done, they began planning how to kill him. But they were afraid of him because the people were so amazed at his teaching.§19 That evening Jesus and the disciples left* the city.§20 The next morning as they passed by the fig tree he had cursed, the disciples noticed it had withered from the roots up. §21 Peter remembered what Jesus had said to the tree on the previous day and exclaimed, "Look, Rabbi! The fig tree you cursed has withered and died!"§22 Then Jesus said to the disciples, "Have faith in God.  §23 I tell you the truth, you can say to this mountain, "May you be lifted up and thrown into the sea,' and it will happen. But you must really believe it will happen and have no doubt in your heart.  §24 I tell you, you can pray for anything, and if you believe that you've received it, it will be yours.  §25 But when you are praying, first forgive anyone you are holding a grudge against, so that your Father in heaven will forgive your sins, too.*"  §[The Authority of Jesus Challenged] 27 Again they entered Jerusalem. As Jesus was walking through the Temple area, the leading priests, the teachers of religious law, and the elders came up to him. §28 They demanded, "By what authority are you doing all these things? Who gave you the right to do them?"§29 "I'll tell you by what authority I do these things if you answer one question,"  Jesus replied. §30 "Did John's authority to baptize come from heaven, or was it merely human? Answer me!" 31 They talked it over among themselves. "If we say it was from heaven, he will ask why we didn't believe John. §32 But do we dare say it was merely human?" For they were afraid of what the people would do, because everyone believed that John was a prophet. §33 So they finally replied, "We don't know." And Jesus responded, "Then I won't tell you by what authority I do these things."        §§Footnotes:§ 11:9 Greek Hosanna, an exclamation of praise that literally means "save now"; also in 11:10.  § 11:9-10 Pss 118:25-26; 148:1. 11 § 11:16 Or from carrying merchandise through the Temple.  § 11:17 Isa 56:7; Jer 7:11.  18 § 11:19 Greek they left; other manuscripts read he left.  § 11:25 Some manuscripts add verse 26, But if you refuse to forgive, your Father in heaven will not forgive your sins. Compare Matt 6:15.  §
NLT/Mark 12	[Parable of the Evil Farmers] 1 Then Jesus began teaching them with stories: "A man planted a vineyard. He built a wall around it, dug a pit for pressing out the grape juice, and built a lookout tower. Then he leased the vineyard to tenant farmers and moved to another country.  §2 At the time of the grape harvest, he sent one of his servants to collect his share of the crop.  §3 But the farmers grabbed the servant, beat him up, and sent him back empty-handed.  §4 The owner then sent another servant, but they insulted him and beat him over the head.  §5 The next servant he sent was killed. Others he sent were either beaten or killed,  §6 until there was only one left-his son whom he loved dearly. The owner finally sent him, thinking, "Surely they will respect my son.' 7 "But the tenant farmers said to one another, "Here comes the heir to this estate. Let's kill him and get the estate for ourselves!'  §8 So they grabbed him and murdered him and threw his body out of the vineyard. 9 "What do you suppose the owner of the vineyard will do?"  Jesus asked. "I'll tell you-he will come and kill those farmers and lease the vineyard to others.  §10 Didn't you ever read this in the Scriptures?  "The stone that the builders rejected  has now become the cornerstone. 11 This is the  Lord  's doing,  and it is wonderful to see.'*" 12 The religious leaders* wanted to arrest Jesus because they realized he was telling the story against them-they were the wicked farmers. But they were afraid of the crowd, so they left him and went away. §[Taxes for Caesar] 13 Later the leaders sent some Pharisees and supporters of Herod to trap Jesus into saying something for which he could be arrested. §14 "Teacher," they said, "we know how honest you are. You are impartial and don't play favorites. You teach the way of God truthfully. Now tell us-is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not? §15 Should we pay them, or shouldn't we?" Jesus saw through their hypocrisy and said, "Why are you trying to trap me? Show me a Roman coin,* and I'll tell you."  §16 When they handed it to him, he asked, "Whose picture and title are stamped on it?"  "Caesar's," they replied.§17 "Well, then,"  Jesus said, "give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar, and give to God what belongs to God."  His reply completely amazed them. §[Discussion about Resurrection] 18 Then Jesus was approached by some Sadducees-religious leaders who say there is no resurrection from the dead. They posed this question: §19 "Teacher, Moses gave us a law that if a man dies, leaving a wife without children, his brother should marry the widow and have a child who will carry on the brother's name.* §20 Well, suppose there were seven brothers. The oldest one married and then died without children. §21 So the second brother married the widow, but he also died without children. Then the third brother married her. §22 This continued with all seven of them, and still there were no children. Last of all, the woman also died. §23 So tell us, whose wife will she be in the resurrection? For all seven were married to her."§24 Jesus replied, "Your mistake is that you don't know the Scriptures, and you don't know the power of God.  §25 For when the dead rise, they will neither marry nor be given in marriage. In this respect they will be like the angels in heaven. 26 "But now, as to whether the dead will be raised-haven't you ever read about this in the writings of Moses, in the story of the burning bush? Long after Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob had died, God said to Moses,* "I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.'* §27 So he is the God of the living, not the dead. You have made a serious error."  §[The Most Important Commandment] 28 One of the teachers of religious law was standing there listening to the debate. He realized that Jesus had answered well, so he asked, "Of all the commandments, which is the most important?"§29 Jesus replied, "The most important commandment is this: "Listen, O Israel! The  Lord  our God is the one and only  Lord  .  §30 And you must love the  Lord  your God with all your heart, all your soul, all your mind, and all your strength.'* §31 The second is equally important: "Love your neighbor as yourself.'* No other commandment is greater than these." 32 The teacher of religious law replied, "Well said, Teacher. You have spoken the truth by saying that there is only one God and no other. §33 And I know it is important to love him with all my heart and all my understanding and all my strength, and to love my neighbor as myself. This is more important than to offer all of the burnt offerings and sacrifices required in the law."§34 Realizing how much the man understood, Jesus said to him, "You are not far from the Kingdom of God."  And after that, no one dared to ask him any more questions. §[Whose Son Is the Messiah?] 35 Later, as Jesus was teaching the people in the Temple, he asked, "Why do the teachers of religious law claim that the Messiah is the son of David?  §36 For David himself, speaking under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, said,  "The  Lord  said to my Lord,  Sit in the place of honor at my right hand  until I humble your enemies beneath your feet.'*Since David himself called the Messiah "my Lord,' how can the Messiah be his son?"  The large crowd listened to him with great delight.§38 Jesus also taught: "Beware of these teachers of religious law! For they like to parade around in flowing robes and receive respectful greetings as they walk in the marketplaces.  §39 And how they love the seats of honor in the synagogues and the head table at banquets.  §40 Yet they shamelessly cheat widows out of their property and then pretend to be pious by making long prayers in public. Because of this, they will be more severely punished."  §[The Widow's Offering] 41 Jesus sat down near the collection box in the Temple and watched as the crowds dropped in their money. Many rich people put in large amounts. §42 Then a poor widow came and dropped in two small coins.*Jesus called his disciples to him and said, "I tell you the truth, this poor widow has given more than all the others who are making contributions.  §44 For they gave a tiny part of their surplus, but she, poor as she is, has given everything she had to live on."        §§Footnotes:§ 12:10-11 Ps 118:22-23.  § 12:12 Greek They.  § 12:15 Greek a denarius.  § 12:19 See Deut 25:5-6.  § 12:26a Greek in the story of the bush?

NLT/Mark 13	[Jesus Speaks about the Future] 1 As Jesus was leaving the Temple that day, one of his disciples said, "Teacher, look at these magnificent buildings! Look at the impressive stones in the walls."§2 Jesus replied, "Yes, look at these great buildings. But they will be completely demolished. Not one stone will be left on top of another!" 3 Later, Jesus sat on the Mount of Olives across the valley from the Temple. Peter, James, John, and Andrew came to him privately and asked him, §4 "Tell us, when will all this happen? What sign will show us that these things are about to be fulfilled?"§5 Jesus replied, "Don't let anyone mislead you,  §6 for many will come in my name, claiming, "I am the Messiah.'* They will deceive many.  §7 And you will hear of wars and threats of wars, but don't panic. Yes, these things must take place, but the end won't follow immediately.  §8 Nation will go to war against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in many parts of the world, as well as famines. But this is only the first of the birth pains, with more to come. 9 "When these things begin to happen, watch out! You will be handed over to the local councils and beaten in the synagogues. You will stand trial before governors and kings because you are my followers. But this will be your opportunity to tell them about me.* §10 For the Good News must first be preached to all nations.* §11 But when you are arrested and stand trial, don't worry in advance about what to say. Just say what God tells you at that time, for it is not you who will be speaking, but the Holy Spirit. 12 "A brother will betray his brother to death, a father will betray his own child, and children will rebel against their parents and cause them to be killed.  §13 And everyone will hate you because you are my followers.* But the one who endures to the end will be saved. 14 "The day is coming when you will see the sacrilegious object that causes desecration* standing where he* should not be."  (Reader, pay attention!) "Then those in Judea must flee to the hills.  §15 A person out on the deck of a roof must not go down into the house to pack.  §16 A person out in the field must not return even to get a coat.  §17 How terrible it will be for pregnant women and for nursing mothers in those days.  §18 And pray that your flight will not be in winter.  §19 For there will be greater anguish in those days than at any time since God created the world. And it will never be so great again.  §20 In fact, unless the Lord shortens that time of calamity, not a single person will survive. But for the sake of his chosen ones he has shortened those days. 21 "Then if anyone tells you, "Look, here is the Messiah,' or "There he is,' don't believe it.  §22 For false messiahs and false prophets will rise up and perform signs and wonders so as to deceive, if possible, even God's chosen ones.  §23 Watch out! I have warned you about this ahead of time! 24 "At that time, after the anguish of those days,  the sun will be darkened,  the moon will give no light, 25 the stars will fall from the sky,  and the powers in the heavens will be shaken.*Then everyone will see the Son of Man* coming on the clouds with great power and glory.* §27 And he will send out his angels to gather his chosen ones from all over the world*-from the farthest ends of the earth and heaven. 28 "Now learn a lesson from the fig tree. When its branches bud and its leaves begin to sprout, you know that summer is near.  §29 In the same way, when you see all these things taking place, you can know that his return is very near, right at the door.  §30 I tell you the truth, this generation* will not pass from the scene before all these things take place.  §31 Heaven and earth will disappear, but my words will never disappear. 32 "However, no one knows the day or hour when these things will happen, not even the angels in heaven or the Son himself. Only the Father knows.  §33 And since you don't know when that time will come, be on guard! Stay alert*! 34 "The coming of the Son of Man can be illustrated by the story of a man going on a long trip. When he left home, he gave each of his slaves instructions about the work they were to do, and he told the gatekeeper to watch for his return.  §35 You, too, must keep watch! For you don't know when the master of the household will return-in the evening, at midnight, before dawn, or at daybreak.  §36 Don't let him find you sleeping when he arrives without warning.  §37 I say to you what I say to everyone: Watch for him!"        §§Footnotes:§ 13:6 Greek claiming, "I am.'  § 13:9 Or But this will be your testimony against them.  § 13:10 Or all peoples.  § 13:13 Greek on account of my name.  § 13:14a Greek the abomination of desolation.

NLT/Mark 14	[Jesus Anointed at Bethany] 1 It was now two days before Passover and the Festival of Unleavened Bread. The leading priests and the teachers of religious law were still looking for an opportunity to capture Jesus secretly and kill him. §2 "But not during the Passover celebration," they agreed, "or the people may riot."§3 Meanwhile, Jesus was in Bethany at the home of Simon, a man who had previously had leprosy. While he was eating,* a woman came in with a beautiful alabaster jar of expensive perfume made from essence of nard. She broke open the jar and poured the perfume over his head.§4 Some of those at the table were indignant. "Why waste such expensive perfume?" they asked. §5 "It could have been sold for a year's wages* and the money given to the poor!" So they scolded her harshly.§6 But Jesus replied, "Leave her alone. Why criticize her for doing such a good thing to me?  §7 You will always have the poor among you, and you can help them whenever you want to. But you will not always have me.  §8 She has done what she could and has anointed my body for burial ahead of time.  §9 I tell you the truth, wherever the Good News is preached throughout the world, this woman's deed will be remembered and discussed."  §[Judas Agrees to Betray Jesus] 10 Then Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve disciples, went to the leading priests to arrange to betray Jesus to them. §11 They were delighted when they heard why he had come, and they promised to give him money. So he began looking for an opportunity to betray Jesus. §[The Last Supper] 12 On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread, when the Passover lamb is sacrificed, Jesus' disciples asked him, "Where do you want us to go to prepare the Passover meal for you?"§13 So Jesus sent two of them into Jerusalem with these instructions: "As you go into the city, a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you. Follow him.  §14 At the house he enters, say to the owner, "The Teacher asks: Where is the guest room where I can eat the Passover meal with my disciples?'  §15 He will take you upstairs to a large room that is already set up. That is where you should prepare our meal."  §16 So the two disciples went into the city and found everything just as Jesus had said, and they prepared the Passover meal there.§17 In the evening Jesus arrived with the Twelve. §18 As they were at the table* eating, Jesus said, "I tell you the truth, one of you eating with me here will betray me." 19 Greatly distressed, each one asked in turn, "Am I the one?"§20 He replied, "It is one of you twelve who is eating from this bowl with me.  §21 For the Son of Man* must die, as the Scriptures declared long ago. But how terrible it will be for the one who betrays him. It would be far better for that man if he had never been born!" 22 As they were eating, Jesus took some bread and blessed it. Then he broke it in pieces and gave it to the disciples, saying, "Take it, for this is my body." 23 And he took a cup of wine and gave thanks to God for it. He gave it to them, and they all drank from it. §24 And he said to them, "This is my blood, which confirms the covenant* between God and his people. It is poured out as a sacrifice for many.  §25 I tell you the truth, I will not drink wine again until the day I drink it new in the Kingdom of God." 26 Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives. §[Jesus Predicts Peter's Denial] 27 On the way, Jesus told them, "All of you will desert me. For the Scriptures say,  "God will strike* the Shepherd,  and the sheep will be scattered.' 28 But after I am raised from the dead, I will go ahead of you to Galilee and meet you there." 29 Peter said to him, "Even if everyone else deserts you, I never will."§30 Jesus replied, "I tell you the truth, Peter-this very night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny three times that you even know me." 31 "No!" Peter declared emphatically. "Even if I have to die with you, I will never deny you!" And all the others vowed the same. §[Jesus Prays in Gethsemane] 32 They went to the olive grove called Gethsemane, and Jesus said, "Sit here while I go and pray."  §33 He took Peter, James, and John with him, and he became deeply troubled and distressed. §34 He told them, "My soul is crushed with grief to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with me." 35 He went on a little farther and fell to the ground. He prayed that, if it were possible, the awful hour awaiting him might pass him by. §36 "Abba, Father,"* he cried out, "everything is possible for you. Please take this cup of suffering away from me. Yet I want your will to be done, not mine." 37 Then he returned and found the disciples asleep. He said to Peter, "Simon, are you asleep? Couldn't you watch with me even one hour?  §38 Keep watch and pray, so that you will not give in to temptation. For the spirit is willing, but the body is weak." 39 Then Jesus left them again and prayed the same prayer as before. §40 When he returned to them again, he found them sleeping, for they couldn't keep their eyes open. And they didn't know what to say.§41 When he returned to them the third time, he said, "Go ahead and sleep. Have your rest. But no-the time has come. The Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.  §42 Up, let's be going. Look, my betrayer is here!"  §[Jesus Is Betrayed and Arrested] 43 And immediately, even as Jesus said this, Judas, one of the twelve disciples, arrived with a crowd of men armed with swords and clubs. They had been sent by the leading priests, the teachers of religious law, and the elders. §44 The traitor, Judas, had given them a prearranged signal: "You will know which one to arrest when I greet him with a kiss. Then you can take him away under guard." §45 As soon as they arrived, Judas walked up to Jesus. "Rabbi!" he exclaimed, and gave him the kiss.§46 Then the others grabbed Jesus and arrested him. §47 But one of the men with Jesus pulled out his sword and struck the high priest's slave, slashing off his ear.§48 Jesus asked them, "Am I some dangerous revolutionary, that you come with swords and clubs to arrest me?  §49 Why didn't you arrest me in the Temple? I was there among you teaching every day. But these things are happening to fulfill what the Scriptures say about me." 50 Then all his disciples deserted him and ran away. §51 One young man following behind was clothed only in a long linen shirt. When the mob tried to grab him, §52 he slipped out of his shirt and ran away naked. §[Jesus before the Council] 53 They took Jesus to the high priest's home where the leading priests, the elders, and the teachers of religious law had gathered. §54 Meanwhile, Peter followed him at a distance and went right into the high priest's courtyard. There he sat with the guards, warming himself by the fire.§55 Inside, the leading priests and the entire high council* were trying to find evidence against Jesus, so they could put him to death. But they couldn't find any. §56 Many false witnesses spoke against him, but they contradicted each other. §57 Finally, some men stood up and gave this false testimony: §58 "We heard him say, "I will destroy this Temple made with human hands, and in three days I will build another, made without human hands.'" §59 But even then they didn't get their stories straight!§60 Then the high priest stood up before the others and asked Jesus, "Well, aren't you going to answer these charges? What do you have to say for yourself?" §61 But Jesus was silent and made no reply. Then the high priest asked him, "Are you the Messiah, the Son of the Blessed One?"§62 Jesus said, " I Am  .* And you will see the Son of Man seated in the place of power at God's right hand* and coming on the clouds of heaven.*" 63 Then the high priest tore his clothing to show his horror and said, "Why do we need other witnesses? §64 You have all heard his blasphemy. What is your verdict?" "Guilty!" they all cried. "He deserves to die!"§65 Then some of them began to spit at him, and they blindfolded him and beat him with their fists. "Prophesy to us," they jeered. And the guards slapped him as they took him away. §[Peter Denies Jesus] 66 Meanwhile, Peter was in the courtyard below. One of the servant girls who worked for the high priest came by §67 and noticed Peter warming himself at the fire. She looked at him closely and said, "You were one of those with Jesus of Nazareth.*"§68 But Peter denied it. "I don't know what you're talking about," he said, and he went out into the entryway. Just then, a rooster crowed.*When the servant girl saw him standing there, she began telling the others, "This man is definitely one of them!" §70 But Peter denied it again. A little later some of the other bystanders confronted Peter and said, "You must be one of them, because you are a Galilean."§71 Peter swore, "A curse on me if I'm lying-I don't know this man you're talking about!" §72 And immediately the rooster crowed the second time. Suddenly, Jesus' words flashed through Peter's mind: "Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny three times that you even know me."  And he broke down and wept.       §§Footnotes:§ 14:3 Or reclining.  § 14:5 Greek for 300 denarii.

NLT/Mark 15	[Jesus' Trial before Pilate] 1 Very early in the morning the leading priests, the elders, and the teachers of religious law-the entire high council*-met to discuss their next step. They bound Jesus, led him away, and took him to Pilate, the Roman governor.§2 Pilate asked Jesus, "Are you the king of the Jews?" Jesus replied, "You have said it." 3 Then the leading priests kept accusing him of many crimes, §4 and Pilate asked him, "Aren't you going to answer them? What about all these charges they are bringing against you?" §5 But Jesus said nothing, much to Pilate's surprise.§6 Now it was the governor's custom each year during the Passover celebration to release one prisoner-anyone the people requested. §7 One of the prisoners at that time was Barabbas, a revolutionary who had committed murder in an uprising. §8 The crowd went to Pilate and asked him to release a prisoner as usual.§9 "Would you like me to release to you this "King of the Jews'?" Pilate asked. §10 (For he realized by now that the leading priests had arrested Jesus out of envy.) §11 But at this point the leading priests stirred up the crowd to demand the release of Barabbas instead of Jesus. §12 Pilate asked them, "Then what should I do with this man you call the king of the Jews?"§13 They shouted back, "Crucify him!"§14 "Why?" Pilate demanded. "What crime has he committed?" But the mob roared even louder, "Crucify him!"§15 So to pacify the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas to them. He ordered Jesus flogged with a lead-tipped whip, then turned him over to the Roman soldiers to be crucified. §[The Soldiers Mock Jesus] 16 The soldiers took Jesus into the courtyard of the governor's headquarters (called the Praetorium) and called out the entire regiment. §17 They dressed him in a purple robe, and they wove thorn branches into a crown and put it on his head. §18 Then they saluted him and taunted, "Hail! King of the Jews!" §19 And they struck him on the head with a reed stick, spit on him, and dropped to their knees in mock worship. §20 When they were finally tired of mocking him, they took off the purple robe and put his own clothes on him again. Then they led him away to be crucified. §[The Crucifixion] 21 A passerby named Simon, who was from Cyrene,* was coming in from the countryside just then, and the soldiers forced him to carry Jesus' cross. (Simon was the father of Alexander and Rufus.) §22 And they brought Jesus to a place called Golgotha (which means "Place of the Skull"). §23 They offered him wine drugged with myrrh, but he refused it.§24 Then the soldiers nailed him to the cross. They divided his clothes and threw dice* to decide who would get each piece. §25 It was nine o'clock in the morning when they crucified him. §26 A sign announced the charge against him. It read, "The King of the Jews." §27 Two revolutionaries* were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.*The people passing by shouted abuse, shaking their heads in mockery. "Ha! Look at you now!" they yelled at him. "You said you were going to destroy the Temple and rebuild it in three days. §30 Well then, save yourself and come down from the cross!"§31 The leading priests and teachers of religious law also mocked Jesus. "He saved others," they scoffed, "but he can't save himself! §32 Let this Messiah, this King of Israel, come down from the cross so we can see it and believe him!" Even the men who were crucified with Jesus ridiculed him. §[The Death of Jesus] 33 At noon, darkness fell across the whole land until three o'clock. §34 Then at three o'clock Jesus called out with a loud voice, "Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?"  which means "My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?"*Some of the bystanders misunderstood and thought he was calling for the prophet Elijah. §36 One of them ran and filled a sponge with sour wine, holding it up to him on a reed stick so he could drink. "Wait!" he said. "Let's see whether Elijah comes to take him down!"§37 Then Jesus uttered another loud cry and breathed his last. §38 And the curtain in the sanctuary of the Temple was torn in two, from top to bottom.§39 When the Roman officer* who stood facing him* saw how he had died, he exclaimed, "This man truly was the Son of God!"§40 Some women were there, watching from a distance, including Mary Magdalene, Mary (the mother of James the younger and of Joseph*), and Salome. §41 They had been followers of Jesus and had cared for him while he was in Galilee. Many other women who had come with him to Jerusalem were also there. §[The Burial of Jesus] 42 This all happened on Friday, the day of preparation,* the day before the Sabbath. As evening approached, §43 Joseph of Arimathea took a risk and went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. (Joseph was an honored member of the high council, and he was waiting for the Kingdom of God to come.) §44 Pilate couldn't believe that Jesus was already dead, so he called for the Roman officer and asked if he had died yet. §45 The officer confirmed that Jesus was dead, so Pilate told Joseph he could have the body. §46 Joseph bought a long sheet of linen cloth. Then he took Jesus' body down from the cross, wrapped it in the cloth, and laid it in a tomb that had been carved out of the rock. Then he rolled a stone in front of the entrance. §47 Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joseph saw where Jesus' body was laid.       §§Footnotes:§ 15:1 Greek the Sanhedrin; also in 15:43.  § 15:21 Cyrene was a city in northern Africa.  § 15:24 Greek cast lots.

NLT/Mark 16	[The Resurrection] 1 Saturday evening, when the Sabbath ended, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome went out and purchased burial spices so they could anoint Jesus' body. §2 Very early on Sunday morning,* just at sunrise, they went to the tomb. §3 On the way they were asking each other, "Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance to the tomb?" §4 But as they arrived, they looked up and saw that the stone, which was very large, had already been rolled aside.§5 When they entered the tomb, they saw a young man clothed in a white robe sitting on the right side. The women were shocked, §6 but the angel said, "Don't be alarmed. You are looking for Jesus of Nazareth,* who was crucified. He isn't here! He is risen from the dead! Look, this is where they laid his body. §7 Now go and tell his disciples, including Peter, that Jesus is going ahead of you to Galilee. You will see him there, just as he told you before he died."§8 The women fled from the tomb, trembling and bewildered, and they said nothing to anyone because they were too frightened.*---------- [ The most ancient manuscripts of Mark conclude with verse 16:8. Later manuscripts add one or both of the following endings. ] [ Shorter Ending of Mark ] Then they briefly reported all this to Peter and his companions. Afterward Jesus himself sent them out from east to west with the sacred and unfailing message of salvation that gives eternal life. Amen. [ Longer Ending of Mark ]§9 After Jesus rose from the dead early on Sunday morning, the first person who saw him was Mary Magdalene, the woman from whom he had cast out seven demons. §10 She went to the disciples, who were grieving and weeping, and told them what had happened. §11 But when she told them that Jesus was alive and she had seen him, they didn't believe her.§12 Afterward he appeared in a different form to two of his followers who were walking from Jerusalem into the country. §13 They rushed back to tell the others, but no one believed them.§14 Still later he appeared to the eleven disciples as they were eating together. He rebuked them for their stubborn unbelief because they refused to believe those who had seen him after he had been raised from the dead.*And then he told them, "Go into all the world and preach the Good News to everyone.  §16 Anyone who believes and is baptized will be saved. But anyone who refuses to believe will be condemned.  §17 These miraculous signs will accompany those who believe: They will cast out demons in my name, and they will speak in new languages.* §18 They will be able to handle snakes with safety, and if they drink anything poisonous, it won't hurt them. They will be able to place their hands on the sick, and they will be healed." 19 When the Lord Jesus had finished talking with them, he was taken up into heaven and sat down in the place of honor at God's right hand. §20 And the disciples went everywhere and preached, and the Lord worked through them, confirming what they said by many miraculous signs.       §§Footnotes:§ 16:2 Greek on the first day of the week; also in 16:9.  § 16:6 Or Jesus the Nazarene.  § 16:8 The most reliable early manuscripts of the Gospel of Mark end at verse 8.

The majority of manuscripts include the "longer ending" immediately after verse 8.  § 16:14 Some early manuscripts add: And they excused themselves, saying, "This age of lawlessness and unbelief is under Satan, who does not permit God's truth and power to conquer the evil [unclean] spirits. Therefore, reveal your justice now." This is what they said to Christ. And Christ replied to them, "The period of years of Satan's power has been fulfilled, but other dreadful things will happen soon. And I was handed over to death for those who have sinned, so that they may return to the truth and sin no more, and so they may inherit the spiritual, incorruptible, and righteous glory in heaven." 15 § 16:17 Or new tongues; some manuscripts do not include new.  §
NLT/Mark 2	[Jesus Heals a Paralyzed Man] 1 When Jesus returned to Capernaum several days later, the news spread quickly that he was back home. §2 Soon the house where he was staying was so packed with visitors that there was no more room, even outside the door. While he was preaching God's word to them, §3 four men arrived carrying a paralyzed man on a mat. §4 They couldn't bring him to Jesus because of the crowd, so they dug a hole through the roof above his head. Then they lowered the man on his mat, right down in front of Jesus. §5 Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralyzed man, "My child, your sins are forgiven." 6 But some of the teachers of religious law who were sitting there thought to themselves, §7 "What is he saying? This is blasphemy! Only God can forgive sins!"§8 Jesus knew immediately what they were thinking, so he asked them, "Why do you question this in your hearts?  §9 Is it easier to say to the paralyzed man "Your sins are forgiven,' or "Stand up, pick up your mat, and walk'?  §10 So I will prove to you that the Son of Man* has the authority on earth to forgive sins."  Then Jesus turned to the paralyzed man and said, §11 "Stand up, pick up your mat, and go home!" 12 And the man jumped up, grabbed his mat, and walked out through the stunned onlookers. They were all amazed and praised God, exclaiming, "We've never seen anything like this before!" §[Jesus Calls Levi (Matthew)] 13 Then Jesus went out to the lakeshore again and taught the crowds that were coming to him. §14 As he walked along, he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at his tax collector's booth. "Follow me and be my disciple,"  Jesus said to him. So Levi got up and followed him.§15 Later, Levi invited Jesus and his disciples to his home as dinner guests, along with many tax collectors and other disreputable sinners. (There were many people of this kind among Jesus' followers.) §16 But when the teachers of religious law who were Pharisees* saw him eating with tax collectors and other sinners, they asked his disciples, "Why does he eat with such scum?*"§17 When Jesus heard this, he told them, "Healthy people don't need a doctor-sick people do. I have come to call not those who think they are righteous, but those who know they are sinners."  §[A Discussion about Fasting] 18 Once when John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting, some people came to Jesus and asked, "Why don't your disciples fast like John's disciples and the Pharisees do?"§19 Jesus replied, "Do wedding guests fast while celebrating with the groom? Of course not. They can't fast while the groom is with them.  §20 But someday the groom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast. 21 "Besides, who would patch old clothing with new cloth? For the new patch would shrink and rip away from the old cloth, leaving an even bigger tear than before. 22 "And no one puts new wine into old wineskins. For the wine would burst the wineskins, and the wine and the skins would both be lost. New wine calls for new wineskins."  §[A Discussion about the Sabbath] 23 One Sabbath day as Jesus was walking through some grainfields, his disciples began breaking off heads of grain to eat. §24 But the Pharisees said to Jesus, "Look, why are they breaking the law by harvesting grain on the Sabbath?"§25 Jesus said to them, "Haven't you ever read in the Scriptures what David did when he and his companions were hungry?  §26 He went into the house of God (during the days when Abiathar was high priest) and broke the law by eating the sacred loaves of bread that only the priests are allowed to eat. He also gave some to his companions." 27 Then Jesus said to them, "The Sabbath was made to meet the needs of people, and not people to meet the requirements of the Sabbath.  §28 So the Son of Man is Lord, even over the Sabbath!"        §§Footnotes:§ 2:10 "Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself.  § 2:16a Greek the scribes of the Pharisees.  § 2:16b Greek with tax collectors and sinners?  §
NLT/Mark 3	[Jesus Heals on the Sabbath] 1 Jesus went into the synagogue again and noticed a man with a deformed hand. §2 Since it was the Sabbath, Jesus' enemies watched him closely. If he healed the man's hand, they planned to accuse him of working on the Sabbath.§3 Jesus said to the man with the deformed hand, "Come and stand in front of everyone."  §4 Then he turned to his critics and asked, "Does the law permit good deeds on the Sabbath, or is it a day for doing evil? Is this a day to save life or to destroy it?"  But they wouldn't answer him.§5 He looked around at them angrily and was deeply saddened by their hard hearts. Then he said to the man, "Hold out your hand."  So the man held out his hand, and it was restored! §6 At once the Pharisees went away and met with the supporters of Herod to plot how to kill Jesus. §[Crowds Follow Jesus] 7 Jesus went out to the lake with his disciples, and a large crowd followed him. They came from all over Galilee, Judea, §8 Jerusalem, Idumea, from east of the Jordan River, and even from as far north as Tyre and Sidon. The news about his miracles had spread far and wide, and vast numbers of people came to see him.§9 Jesus instructed his disciples to have a boat ready so the crowd would not crush him. §10 He had healed many people that day, so all the sick people eagerly pushed forward to touch him. §11 And whenever those possessed by evil* spirits caught sight of him, the spirits would throw them to the ground in front of him shrieking, "You are the Son of God!" §12 But Jesus sternly commanded the spirits not to reveal who he was. §[Jesus Chooses the Twelve Apostles] 13 Afterward Jesus went up on a mountain and called out the ones he wanted to go with him. And they came to him. §14 Then he appointed twelve of them and called them his apostles.* They were to accompany him, and he would send them out to preach, §15 giving them authority to cast out demons. §16 These are the twelve he chose: Simon (whom he named Peter),§17 James and John (the sons of Zebedee, but Jesus nicknamed them "Sons of Thunder"*),§18 Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James (son of Alphaeus), Thaddaeus, Simon (the zealot*),§19 Judas Iscariot (who later betrayed him). §[Jesus and the Prince of Demons] 20 One time Jesus entered a house, and the crowds began to gather again. Soon he and his disciples couldn't even find time to eat. §21 When his family heard what was happening, they tried to take him away. "He's out of his mind," they said.§22 But the teachers of religious law who had arrived from Jerusalem said, "He's possessed by Satan,* the prince of demons. That's where he gets the power to cast out demons."§23 Jesus called them over and responded with an illustration. "How can Satan cast out Satan?"  he asked. §24 "A kingdom divided by civil war will collapse.  §25 Similarly, a family splintered by feuding will fall apart.  §26 And if Satan is divided and fights against himself, how can he stand? He would never survive.  §27 Let me illustrate this further. Who is powerful enough to enter the house of a strong man and plunder his goods? Only someone even stronger-someone who could tie him up and then plunder his house. 28 "I tell you the truth, all sin and blasphemy can be forgiven,  §29 but anyone who blasphemes the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven. This is a sin with eternal consequences."  §30 He told them this because they were saying, "He's possessed by an evil spirit." §[The True Family of Jesus] 31 Then Jesus' mother and brothers came to see him. They stood outside and sent word for him to come out and talk with them. §32 There was a crowd sitting around Jesus, and someone said, "Your mother and your brothers* are outside asking for you."§33 Jesus replied, "Who is my mother? Who are my brothers?"  §34 Then he looked at those around him and said, "Look, these are my mother and brothers.  §35 Anyone who does God's will is my brother and sister and mother."        §§Footnotes:§ 3:11 Greek unclean; also in 3:30.  § 3:14 Some manuscripts do not include and called them his apostles.  § 3:17 Greek whom he named Boanerges, which means Sons of Thunder.  § 3:18 Greek the Cananean, an Aramaic term for Jewish nationalists.  § 3:22 Greek Beelzeboul; other manuscripts read Beezeboul; Latin version reads Beelzebub.  § 3:32 Some manuscripts add and sisters.  §
NLT/Mark 4	[Parable of the Farmer Scattering Seed] 1 Once again Jesus began teaching by the lakeshore. A very large crowd soon gathered around him, so he got into a boat. Then he sat in the boat while all the people remained on the shore. §2 He taught them by telling many stories in the form of parables, such as this one:§3 "Listen! A farmer went out to plant some seed.  §4 As he scattered it across his field, some of the seed fell on a footpath, and the birds came and ate it.  §5 Other seed fell on shallow soil with underlying rock. The seed sprouted quickly because the soil was shallow.  §6 But the plant soon wilted under the hot sun, and since it didn't have deep roots, it died.  §7 Other seed fell among thorns that grew up and choked out the tender plants so they produced no grain.  §8 Still other seeds fell on fertile soil, and they sprouted, grew, and produced a crop that was thirty, sixty, and even a hundred times as much as had been planted!"  §9 Then he said, "Anyone with ears to hear should listen and understand." 10 Later, when Jesus was alone with the twelve disciples and with the others who were gathered around, they asked him what the parables meant.§11 He replied, "You are permitted to understand the secret* of the Kingdom of God. But I use parables for everything I say to outsiders,  §12 so that the Scriptures might be fulfilled:  "When they see what I do,  they will learn nothing.  When they hear what I say,  they will not understand.  Otherwise, they will turn to me  and be forgiven.'*" 13 Then Jesus said to them, "If you can't understand the meaning of this parable, how will you understand all the other parables?  §14 The farmer plants seed by taking God's word to others.  §15 The seed that fell on the footpath represents those who hear the message, only to have Satan come at once and take it away.  §16 The seed on the rocky soil represents those who hear the message and immediately receive it with joy.  §17 But since they don't have deep roots, they don't last long. They fall away as soon as they have problems or are persecuted for believing God's word.  §18 The seed that fell among the thorns represents others who hear God's word,  §19 but all too quickly the message is crowded out by the worries of this life, the lure of wealth, and the desire for other things, so no fruit is produced.  §20 And the seed that fell on good soil represents those who hear and accept God's word and produce a harvest of thirty, sixty, or even a hundred times as much as had been planted!"  §[Parable of the Lamp] 21 Then Jesus asked them, "Would anyone light a lamp and then put it under a basket or under a bed? Of course not! A lamp is placed on a stand, where its light will shine.  §22 For everything that is hidden will eventually be brought into the open, and every secret will be brought to light.  §23 Anyone with ears to hear should listen and understand." 24 Then he added, "Pay close attention to what you hear. The closer you listen, the more understanding you will be given*-and you will receive even more.  §25 To those who listen to my teaching, more understanding will be given. But for those who are not listening, even what little understanding they have will be taken away from them."  §[Parable of the Growing Seed] 26 Jesus also said, "The Kingdom of God is like a farmer who scatters seed on the ground.  §27 Night and day, while he's asleep or awake, the seed sprouts and grows, but he does not understand how it happens.  §28 The earth produces the crops on its own. First a leaf blade pushes through, then the heads of wheat are formed, and finally the grain ripens.  §29 And as soon as the grain is ready, the farmer comes and harvests it with a sickle, for the harvest time has come."  §[Parable of the Mustard Seed] 30 Jesus said, "How can I describe the Kingdom of God? What story should I use to illustrate it?  §31 It is like a mustard seed planted in the ground. It is the smallest of all seeds,  §32 but it becomes the largest of all garden plants; it grows long branches, and birds can make nests in its shade." 33 Jesus used many similar stories and illustrations to teach the people as much as they could understand. §34 In fact, in his public ministry he never taught without using parables; but afterward, when he was alone with his disciples, he explained everything to them. §[Jesus Calms the Storm] 35 As evening came, Jesus said to his disciples, "Let's cross to the other side of the lake."  §36 So they took Jesus in the boat and started out, leaving the crowds behind (although other boats followed). §37 But soon a fierce storm came up. High waves were breaking into the boat, and it began to fill with water.§38 Jesus was sleeping at the back of the boat with his head on a cushion. The disciples woke him up, shouting, "Teacher, don't you care that we're going to drown?"§39 When Jesus woke up, he rebuked the wind and said to the waves, "Silence! Be still!"  Suddenly the wind stopped, and there was a great calm. §40 Then he asked them, "Why are you afraid? Do you still have no faith?" §41 The disciples were absolutely terrified. "Who is this man?" they asked each other. "Even the wind and waves obey him!"       §§Footnotes:§ 4:11 Greek mystery.  § 4:12 Isa 6:9-10 (Greek version).  § 4:24 Or The measure you give will be the measure you get back.  §
NLT/Mark 5	[Jesus Heals a Demon-Possessed Man] 1 So they arrived at the other side of the lake, in the region of the Gerasenes.* §2 When Jesus climbed out of the boat, a man possessed by an evil* spirit came out from the tombs to meet him. §3 This man lived in the burial caves and could no longer be restrained, even with a chain. §4 Whenever he was put into chains and shackles-as he often was-he snapped the chains from his wrists and smashed the shackles. No one was strong enough to subdue him. §5 Day and night he wandered among the burial caves and in the hills, howling and cutting himself with sharp stones.§6 When Jesus was still some distance away, the man saw him, ran to meet him, and bowed low before him. §7 With a shriek, he screamed, "Why are you interfering with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? In the name of God, I beg you, don't torture me!" §8 For Jesus had already said to the spirit, "Come out of the man, you evil spirit." 9 Then Jesus demanded, "What is your name?"  And he replied, "My name is Legion, because there are many of us inside this man." §10 Then the evil spirits begged him again and again not to send them to some distant place.§11 There happened to be a large herd of pigs feeding on the hillside nearby. §12 "Send us into those pigs," the spirits begged. "Let us enter them."§13 So Jesus gave them permission. The evil spirits came out of the man and entered the pigs, and the entire herd of about 2,000 pigs plunged down the steep hillside into the lake and drowned in the water.§14 The herdsmen fled to the nearby town and the surrounding countryside, spreading the news as they ran. People rushed out to see what had happened. §15 A crowd soon gathered around Jesus, and they saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons. He was sitting there fully clothed and perfectly sane, and they were all afraid. §16 Then those who had seen what happened told the others about the demon-possessed man and the pigs. §17 And the crowd began pleading with Jesus to go away and leave them alone.§18 As Jesus was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon possessed begged to go with him. §19 But Jesus said, "No, go home to your family, and tell them everything the Lord has done for you and how merciful he has been."  §20 So the man started off to visit the Ten Towns* of that region and began to proclaim the great things Jesus had done for him; and everyone was amazed at what he told them. §[Jesus Heals in Response to Faith] 21 Jesus got into the boat again and went back to the other side of the lake, where a large crowd gathered around him on the shore. §22 Then a leader of the local synagogue, whose name was Jairus, arrived. When he saw Jesus, he fell at his feet, §23 pleading fervently with him. "My little daughter is dying," he said. "Please come and lay your hands on her; heal her so she can live."§24 Jesus went with him, and all the people followed, crowding around him. §25 A woman in the crowd had suffered for twelve years with constant bleeding. §26 She had suffered a great deal from many doctors, and over the years she had spent everything she had to pay them, but she had gotten no better. In fact, she had gotten worse. §27 She had heard about Jesus, so she came up behind him through the crowd and touched his robe. §28 For she thought to herself, "If I can just touch his robe, I will be healed." §29 Immediately the bleeding stopped, and she could feel in her body that she had been healed of her terrible condition.§30 Jesus realized at once that healing power had gone out from him, so he turned around in the crowd and asked, "Who touched my robe?" 31 His disciples said to him, "Look at this crowd pressing around you. How can you ask, "Who touched me?'"§32 But he kept on looking around to see who had done it. §33 Then the frightened woman, trembling at the realization of what had happened to her, came and fell to her knees in front of him and told him what she had done. §34 And he said to her, "Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace. Your suffering is over." 35 While he was still speaking to her, messengers arrived from the home of Jairus, the leader of the synagogue. They told him, "Your daughter is dead. There's no use troubling the Teacher now."§36 But Jesus overheard* them and said to Jairus, "Don't be afraid. Just have faith." 37 Then Jesus stopped the crowd and wouldn't let anyone go with him except Peter, James, and John (the brother of James). §38 When they came to the home of the synagogue leader, Jesus saw much commotion and weeping and wailing. §39 He went inside and asked, "Why all this commotion and weeping? The child isn't dead; she's only asleep." 40 The crowd laughed at him. But he made them all leave, and he took the girl's father and mother and his three disciples into the room where the girl was lying. §41 Holding her hand, he said to her, "Talitha koum,"  which means "Little girl, get up!"  §42 And the girl, who was twelve years old, immediately stood up and walked around! They were overwhelmed and totally amazed. §43 Jesus gave them strict orders not to tell anyone what had happened, and then he told them to give her something to eat.       §§Footnotes:§ 5:1 Other manuscripts read Gadarenes; still others read Gergesenes.

NLT/Mark 6	[Jesus Rejected at Nazareth] 1 Jesus left that part of the country and returned with his disciples to Nazareth, his hometown. §2 The next Sabbath he began teaching in the synagogue, and many who heard him were amazed. They asked, "Where did he get all this wisdom and the power to perform such miracles?" §3 Then they scoffed, "He's just a carpenter, the son of Mary* and the brother of James, Joseph,* Judas, and Simon. And his sisters live right here among us." They were deeply offended and refused to believe in him.§4 Then Jesus told them, "A prophet is honored everywhere except in his own hometown and among his relatives and his own family."  §5 And because of their unbelief, he couldn't do any miracles among them except to place his hands on a few sick people and heal them. §6 And he was amazed at their unbelief. [Jesus Sends Out the Twelve Disciples] Then Jesus went from village to village, teaching the people. §7 And he called his twelve disciples together and began sending them out two by two, giving them authority to cast out evil* spirits. §8 He told them to take nothing for their journey except a walking stick-no food, no traveler's bag, no money.* §9 He allowed them to wear sandals but not to take a change of clothes.§10 "Wherever you go,"  he said, "stay in the same house until you leave town.  §11 But if any place refuses to welcome you or listen to you, shake its dust from your feet as you leave to show that you have abandoned those people to their fate." §12 So the disciples went out, telling everyone they met to repent of their sins and turn to God. §13 And they cast out many demons and healed many sick people, anointing them with olive oil. §[The Death of John the Baptist] 14 Herod Antipas, the king, soon heard about Jesus, because everyone was talking about him. Some were saying,* "This must be John the Baptist raised from the dead. That is why he can do such miracles." §15 Others said, "He's the prophet Elijah." Still others said, "He's a prophet like the other great prophets of the past."§16 When Herod heard about Jesus, he said, "John, the man I beheaded, has come back from the dead."§17 For Herod had sent soldiers to arrest and imprison John as a favor to Herodias. She had been his brother Philip's wife, but Herod had married her. §18 John had been telling Herod, "It is against God's law for you to marry your brother's wife." §19 So Herodias bore a grudge against John and wanted to kill him. But without Herod's approval she was powerless, §20 for Herod respected John; and knowing that he was a good and holy man, he protected him. Herod was greatly disturbed whenever he talked with John, but even so, he liked to listen to him.§21 Herodias's chance finally came on Herod's birthday. He gave a party for his high government officials, army officers, and the leading citizens of Galilee. §22 Then his daughter, also named Herodias,* came in and performed a dance that greatly pleased Herod and his guests. "Ask me for anything you like," the king said to the girl, "and I will give it to you." §23 He even vowed, "I will give you whatever you ask, up to half my kingdom!"§24 She went out and asked her mother, "What should I ask for?" Her mother told her, "Ask for the head of John the Baptist!"§25 So the girl hurried back to the king and told him, "I want the head of John the Baptist, right now, on a tray!"§26 Then the king deeply regretted what he had said; but because of the vows he had made in front of his guests, he couldn't refuse her. §27 So he immediately sent an executioner to the prison to cut off John's head and bring it to him. The soldier beheaded John in the prison, §28 brought his head on a tray, and gave it to the girl, who took it to her mother. §29 When John's disciples heard what had happened, they came to get his body and buried it in a tomb. §[Jesus Feeds Five Thousand] 30 The apostles returned to Jesus from their ministry tour and told him all they had done and taught. §31 Then Jesus said, "Let's go off by ourselves to a quiet place and rest awhile."  He said this because there were so many people coming and going that Jesus and his apostles didn't even have time to eat.§32 So they left by boat for a quiet place, where they could be alone. §33 But many people recognized them and saw them leaving, and people from many towns ran ahead along the shore and got there ahead of them. §34 Jesus saw the huge crowd as he stepped from the boat, and he had compassion on them because they were like sheep without a shepherd. So he began teaching them many things.§35 Late in the afternoon his disciples came to him and said, "This is a remote place, and it's already getting late. §36 Send the crowds away so they can go to the nearby farms and villages and buy something to eat."§37 But Jesus said, "You feed them."  "With what?" they asked. "We'd have to work for months to earn enough money* to buy food for all these people!"§38 "How much bread do you have?"  he asked. "Go and find out."  They came back and reported, "We have five loaves of bread and two fish."§39 Then Jesus told the disciples to have the people sit down in groups on the green grass. §40 So they sat down in groups of fifty or a hundred.§41 Jesus took the five loaves and two fish, looked up toward heaven, and blessed them. Then, breaking the loaves into pieces, he kept giving the bread to the disciples so they could distribute it to the people. He also divided the fish for everyone to share. §42 They all ate as much as they wanted, §43 and afterward, the disciples picked up twelve baskets of leftover bread and fish. §44 A total of 5,000 men and their families were fed.§[Jesus Walks on Water] 45 Immediately after this, Jesus insisted that his disciples get back into the boat and head across the lake to Bethsaida, while he sent the people home. §46 After telling everyone good-bye, he went up into the hills by himself to pray.§47 Late that night, the disciples were in their boat in the middle of the lake, and Jesus was alone on land. §48 He saw that they were in serious trouble, rowing hard and struggling against the wind and waves. About three o'clock in the morning* Jesus came toward them, walking on the water. He intended to go past them, §49 but when they saw him walking on the water, they cried out in terror, thinking he was a ghost. §50 They were all terrified when they saw him. But Jesus spoke to them at once. "Don't be afraid,"  he said. "Take courage! I am here!*"  §51 Then he climbed into the boat, and the wind stopped. They were totally amazed, §52 for they still didn't understand the significance of the miracle of the loaves. Their hearts were too hard to take it in.§53 After they had crossed the lake, they landed at Gennesaret. They brought the boat to shore §54 and climbed out. The people recognized Jesus at once, §55 and they ran throughout the whole area, carrying sick people on mats to wherever they heard he was. §56 Wherever he went-in villages, cities, or the countryside-they brought the sick out to the marketplaces. They begged him to let the sick touch at least the fringe of his robe, and all who touched him were healed.       §§Footnotes:§ 6:3a Some manuscripts read He's just the son of the carpenter and of Mary.  § 6:3b Most manuscripts read Joses; see Matt 13:55.  § 6:7 Greek unclean.  § 6:8 Greek no copper coins in their money belts.  § 6:14 Some manuscripts read He was saying.  § 6:22 Some manuscripts read the daughter of Herodias herself.  § 6:37 Greek It would take 200 denarii.

NLT/Mark 7	[Jesus Teaches about Inner Purity] 1 One day some Pharisees and teachers of religious law arrived from Jerusalem to see Jesus. §2 They noticed that some of his disciples failed to follow the Jewish ritual of hand washing before eating. §3 (The Jews, especially the Pharisees, do not eat until they have poured water over their cupped hands,* as required by their ancient traditions. §4 Similarly, they don't eat anything from the market until they immerse their hands* in water. This is but one of many traditions they have clung to-such as their ceremonial washing of cups, pitchers, and kettles.*)§5 So the Pharisees and teachers of religious law asked him, "Why don't your disciples follow our age-old tradition? They eat without first performing the hand-washing ceremony."§6 Jesus replied, "You hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you, for he wrote,  "These people honor me with their lips,  but their hearts are far from me. 7 Their worship is a farce,  for they teach man-made ideas as commands from God.'*For you ignore God's law and substitute your own tradition." 9 Then he said, "You skillfully sidestep God's law in order to hold on to your own tradition.  §10 For instance, Moses gave you this law from God: "Honor your father and mother,'* and "Anyone who speaks disrespectfully of father or mother must be put to death.'* §11 But you say it is all right for people to say to their parents, "Sorry, I can't help you. For I have vowed to give to God what I would have given to you.'* §12 In this way, you let them disregard their needy parents.  §13 And so you cancel the word of God in order to hand down your own tradition. And this is only one example among many others." 14 Then Jesus called to the crowd to come and hear. "All of you listen,"  he said, "and try to understand.  §15 It's not what goes into your body that defiles you; you are defiled by what comes from your heart.*" 17 Then Jesus went into a house to get away from the crowd, and his disciples asked him what he meant by the parable he had just used. §18 "Don't you understand either?"  he asked. "Can't you see that the food you put into your body cannot defile you?  §19 Food doesn't go into your heart, but only passes through the stomach and then goes into the sewer."  (By saying this, he declared that every kind of food is acceptable in God's eyes.)§20 And then he added, "It is what comes from inside that defiles you.  §21 For from within, out of a person's heart, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder,  §22 adultery, greed, wickedness, deceit, lustful desires, envy, slander, pride, and foolishness.  §23 All these vile things come from within; they are what defile you."  §[The Faith of a Gentile Woman] 24 Then Jesus left Galilee and went north to the region of Tyre.* He didn't want anyone to know which house he was staying in, but he couldn't keep it a secret. §25 Right away a woman who had heard about him came and fell at his feet. Her little girl was possessed by an evil* spirit, §26 and she begged him to cast out the demon from her daughter. Since she was a Gentile, born in Syrian Phoenicia, §27 Jesus told her, "First I should feed the children-my own family, the Jews.* It isn't right to take food from the children and throw it to the dogs." 28 She replied, "That's true, Lord, but even the dogs under the table are allowed to eat the scraps from the children's plates."§29 "Good answer!"  he said. "Now go home, for the demon has left your daughter."  §30 And when she arrived home, she found her little girl lying quietly in bed, and the demon was gone. §[Jesus Heals a Deaf Man] 31 Jesus left Tyre and went up to Sidon before going back to the Sea of Galilee and the region of the Ten Towns.* §32 A deaf man with a speech impediment was brought to him, and the people begged Jesus to lay his hands on the man to heal him.§33 Jesus led him away from the crowd so they could be alone. He put his fingers into the man's ears. Then, spitting on his own fingers, he touched the man's tongue. §34 Looking up to heaven, he sighed and said, "Ephphatha,"  which means, "Be opened!"  §35 Instantly the man could hear perfectly, and his tongue was freed so he could speak plainly!§36 Jesus told the crowd not to tell anyone, but the more he told them not to, the more they spread the news. §37 They were completely amazed and said again and again, "Everything he does is wonderful. He even makes the deaf to hear and gives speech to those who cannot speak."       §§Footnotes:§ 7:3 Greek have washed with the fist.  § 7:4a Some manuscripts read sprinkle themselves.  § 7:4b Some manuscripts add and dining couches.  § 7:7 Isa 29:13 (Greek version).  8 § 7:10a Exod 20:12; Deut 5:16.  § 7:10b Exod 21:17 (Greek version); Lev 20:9 (Greek version).  § 7:11 Greek "What I would have given to you is Corban' (that is, a gift).  § 7:15 Some manuscripts add verse 16, Anyone with ears to hear should listen and understand.

NLT/Mark 8	[Jesus Feeds Four Thousand] 1 About this time another large crowd had gathered, and the people ran out of food again. Jesus called his disciples and told them, §2 "I feel sorry for these people. They have been here with me for three days, and they have nothing left to eat.  §3 If I send them home hungry, they will faint along the way. For some of them have come a long distance." 4 His disciples replied, "How are we supposed to find enough food to feed them out here in the wilderness?"§5 Jesus asked, "How much bread do you have?"  "Seven loaves," they replied.§6 So Jesus told all the people to sit down on the ground. Then he took the seven loaves, thanked God for them, and broke them into pieces. He gave them to his disciples, who distributed the bread to the crowd. §7 A few small fish were found, too, so Jesus also blessed these and told the disciples to distribute them.§8 They ate as much as they wanted. Afterward, the disciples picked up seven large baskets of leftover food. §9 There were about 4,000 men in the crowd that day, and Jesus sent them home after they had eaten. §10 Immediately after this, he got into a boat with his disciples and crossed over to the region of Dalmanutha. §[Pharisees Demand a Miraculous Sign] 11 When the Pharisees heard that Jesus had arrived, they came and started to argue with him. Testing him, they demanded that he show them a miraculous sign from heaven to prove his authority.§12 When he heard this, he sighed deeply in his spirit and said, "Why do these people keep demanding a miraculous sign? I tell you the truth, I will not give this generation any such sign."  §13 So he got back into the boat and left them, and he crossed to the other side of the lake. §[Yeast of the Pharisees and Herod] 14 But the disciples had forgotten to bring any food. They had only one loaf of bread with them in the boat. §15 As they were crossing the lake, Jesus warned them, "Watch out! Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and of Herod." 16 At this they began to argue with each other because they hadn't brought any bread. §17 Jesus knew what they were saying, so he said, "Why are you arguing about having no bread? Don't you know or understand even yet? Are your hearts too hard to take it in?  §18 "You have eyes-can't you see? You have ears-can't you hear?'* Don't you remember anything at all?  §19 When I fed the 5,000 with five loaves of bread, how many baskets of leftovers did you pick up afterward?"  "Twelve," they said.§20 "And when I fed the 4,000 with seven loaves, how many large baskets of leftovers did you pick up?"  "Seven," they said.§21 "Don't you understand yet?"  he asked them. §[Jesus Heals a Blind Man] 22 When they arrived at Bethsaida, some people brought a blind man to Jesus, and they begged him to touch the man and heal him. §23 Jesus took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village. Then, spitting on the man's eyes, he laid his hands on him and asked, "Can you see anything now?" 24 The man looked around. "Yes," he said, "I see people, but I can't see them very clearly. They look like trees walking around."§25 Then Jesus placed his hands on the man's eyes again, and his eyes were opened. His sight was completely restored, and he could see everything clearly. §26 Jesus sent him away, saying, "Don't go back into the village on your way home."  §[Peter's Declaration about Jesus] 27 Jesus and his disciples left Galilee and went up to the villages near Caesarea Philippi. As they were walking along, he asked them, "Who do people say I am?" 28 "Well," they replied, "some say John the Baptist, some say Elijah, and others say you are one of the other prophets."§29 Then he asked them, "But who do you say I am?"  Peter replied, "You are the Messiah.*"§30 But Jesus warned them not to tell anyone about him. §[Jesus Predicts His Death] 31 Then Jesus began to tell them that the Son of Man* must suffer many terrible things and be rejected by the elders, the leading priests, and the teachers of religious law. He would be killed, but three days later he would rise from the dead. §32 As he talked about this openly with his disciples, Peter took him aside and began to reprimand him for saying such things.*Jesus turned around and looked at his disciples, then reprimanded Peter. "Get away from me, Satan!"  he said. "You are seeing things merely from a human point of view, not from God's." 34 Then, calling the crowd to join his disciples, he said, "If any of you wants to be my follower, you must give up your own way, take up your cross, and follow me.  §35 If you try to hang on to your life, you will lose it. But if you give up your life for my sake and for the sake of the Good News, you will save it.  §36 And what do you benefit if you gain the whole world but lose your own soul?* §37 Is anything worth more than your soul?  §38 If anyone is ashamed of me and my message in these adulterous and sinful days, the Son of Man will be ashamed of that person when he returns in the glory of his Father with the holy angels."        §§Footnotes:§ 8:18 Jer 5:21.  § 8:29 Or the Christ.

NLT/Mark 9	1 Jesus went on to say, "I tell you the truth, some standing here right now will not die before they see the Kingdom of God arrive in great power!"  §[The Transfiguration] 2 Six days later Jesus took Peter, James, and John, and led them up a high mountain to be alone. As the men watched, Jesus' appearance was transformed, §3 and his clothes became dazzling white, far whiter than any earthly bleach could ever make them. §4 Then Elijah and Moses appeared and began talking with Jesus.§5 Peter exclaimed, "Rabbi, it's wonderful for us to be here! Let's make three shelters as memorials*-one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah." §6 He said this because he didn't really know what else to say, for they were all terrified.§7 Then a cloud overshadowed them, and a voice from the cloud said, "This is my dearly loved Son. Listen to him." §8 Suddenly, when they looked around, Moses and Elijah were gone, and they saw only Jesus with them.§9 As they went back down the mountain, he told them not to tell anyone what they had seen until the Son of Man* had risen from the dead. §10 So they kept it to themselves, but they often asked each other what he meant by "rising from the dead."§11 Then they asked him, "Why do the teachers of religious law insist that Elijah must return before the Messiah comes?*"§12 Jesus responded, "Elijah is indeed coming first to get everything ready. Yet why do the Scriptures say that the Son of Man must suffer greatly and be treated with utter contempt?  §13 But I tell you, Elijah has already come, and they chose to abuse him, just as the Scriptures predicted."  §[Jesus Heals a Demon-Possessed Boy] 14 When they returned to the other disciples, they saw a large crowd surrounding them, and some teachers of religious law were arguing with them. §15 When the crowd saw Jesus, they were overwhelmed with awe, and they ran to greet him.§16 "What is all this arguing about?"  Jesus asked.§17 One of the men in the crowd spoke up and said, "Teacher, I brought my son so you could heal him. He is possessed by an evil spirit that won't let him talk. §18 And whenever this spirit seizes him, it throws him violently to the ground. Then he foams at the mouth and grinds his teeth and becomes rigid.* So I asked your disciples to cast out the evil spirit, but they couldn't do it."§19 Jesus said to them,*  "You faithless people! How long must I be with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring the boy to me." 20 So they brought the boy. But when the evil spirit saw Jesus, it threw the child into a violent convulsion, and he fell to the ground, writhing and foaming at the mouth.§21 "How long has this been happening?"  Jesus asked the boy's father. He replied, "Since he was a little boy. §22 The spirit often throws him into the fire or into water, trying to kill him. Have mercy on us and help us, if you can."§23 "What do you mean, "If I can'?"  Jesus asked. "Anything is possible if a person believes." 24 The father instantly cried out, "I do believe, but help me overcome my unbelief!"§25 When Jesus saw that the crowd of onlookers was growing, he rebuked the evil* spirit. "Listen, you spirit that makes this boy unable to hear and speak,"  he said. "I command you to come out of this child and never enter him again!" 26 Then the spirit screamed and threw the boy into another violent convulsion and left him. The boy appeared to be dead. A murmur ran through the crowd as people said, "He's dead." §27 But Jesus took him by the hand and helped him to his feet, and he stood up.§28 Afterward, when Jesus was alone in the house with his disciples, they asked him, "Why couldn't we cast out that evil spirit?"§29 Jesus replied, "This kind can be cast out only by prayer.*"  §[Jesus Again Predicts His Death] 30 Leaving that region, they traveled through Galilee. Jesus didn't want anyone to know he was there, §31 for he wanted to spend more time with his disciples and teach them. He said to them, "The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of his enemies. He will be killed, but three days later he will rise from the dead."  §32 They didn't understand what he was saying, however, and they were afraid to ask him what he meant. §[The Greatest in the Kingdom] 33 After they arrived at Capernaum and settled in a house, Jesus asked his disciples, "What were you discussing out on the road?"  §34 But they didn't answer, because they had been arguing about which of them was the greatest. §35 He sat down, called the twelve disciples over to him, and said, "Whoever wants to be first must take last place and be the servant of everyone else." 36 Then he put a little child among them. Taking the child in his arms, he said to them, §37 "Anyone who welcomes a little child like this on my behalf* welcomes me, and anyone who welcomes me welcomes not only me but also my Father who sent me."  §[Using the Name of Jesus] 38 John said to Jesus, "Teacher, we saw someone using your name to cast out demons, but we told him to stop because he wasn't in our group."§39 "Don't stop him!"  Jesus said. "No one who performs a miracle in my name will soon be able to speak evil of me.  §40 Anyone who is not against us is for us.  §41 If anyone gives you even a cup of water because you belong to the Messiah, I tell you the truth, that person will surely be rewarded. 42 "But if you cause one of these little ones who trusts in me to fall into sin, it would be better for you to be thrown into the sea with a large millstone hung around your neck.  §43 If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off.

NLT/Luke 1	[Introduction] 1 Many people have set out to write accounts about the events that have been fulfilled among us. §2 They used the eyewitness reports circulating among us from the early disciples.* §3 Having carefully investigated everything from the beginning, I also have decided to write an accurate account for you, most honorable Theophilus, §4 so you can be certain of the truth of everything you were taught. §[The Birth of John the Baptist Foretold] 5 When Herod was king of Judea, there was a Jewish priest named Zechariah. He was a member of the priestly order of Abijah, and his wife, Elizabeth, was also from the priestly line of Aaron. §6 Zechariah and Elizabeth were righteous in God's eyes, careful to obey all of the Lord's commandments and regulations. §7 They had no children because Elizabeth was unable to conceive, and they were both very old.§8 One day Zechariah was serving God in the Temple, for his order was on duty that week. §9 As was the custom of the priests, he was chosen by lot to enter the sanctuary of the Lord and burn incense. §10 While the incense was being burned, a great crowd stood outside, praying.§11 While Zechariah was in the sanctuary, an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing to the right of the incense altar. §12 Zechariah was shaken and overwhelmed with fear when he saw him. §13 But the angel said, "Don't be afraid, Zechariah! God has heard your prayer. Your wife, Elizabeth, will give you a son, and you are to name him John. §14 You will have great joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth, §15 for he will be great in the eyes of the Lord. He must never touch wine or other alcoholic drinks. He will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even before his birth.* §16 And he will turn many Israelites to the Lord their God. §17 He will be a man with the spirit and power of Elijah. He will prepare the people for the coming of the Lord. He will turn the hearts of the fathers to their children,* and he will cause those who are rebellious to accept the wisdom of the godly."§18 Zechariah said to the angel, "How can I be sure this will happen? I'm an old man now, and my wife is also well along in years."§19 Then the angel said, "I am Gabriel! I stand in the very presence of God. It was he who sent me to bring you this good news! §20 But now, since you didn't believe what I said, you will be silent and unable to speak until the child is born. For my words will certainly be fulfilled at the proper time."§21 Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zechariah to come out of the sanctuary, wondering why he was taking so long. §22 When he finally did come out, he couldn't speak to them. Then they realized from his gestures and his silence that he must have seen a vision in the sanctuary.§23 When Zechariah's week of service in the Temple was over, he returned home. §24 Soon afterward his wife, Elizabeth, became pregnant and went into seclusion for five months. §25 "How kind the Lord is!" she exclaimed. "He has taken away my disgrace of having no children." §[The Birth of Jesus Foretold] 26 In the sixth month of Elizabeth's pregnancy, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a village in Galilee, §27 to a virgin named Mary. She was engaged to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant of King David. §28 Gabriel appeared to her and said, "Greetings,* favored woman! The Lord is with you!*"§29 Confused and disturbed, Mary tried to think what the angel could mean. §30 "Don't be afraid, Mary," the angel told her, "for you have found favor with God! §31 You will conceive and give birth to a son, and you will name him Jesus. §32 He will be very great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his ancestor David. §33 And he will reign over Israel* forever; his Kingdom will never end!"§34 Mary asked the angel, "But how can this happen? I am a virgin."§35 The angel replied, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the baby to be born will be holy, and he will be called the Son of God. §36 What's more, your relative Elizabeth has become pregnant in her old age! People used to say she was barren, but she has conceived a son and is now in her sixth month. §37 For the word of God will never fail.*"§38 Mary responded, "I am the Lord's servant. May everything you have said about me come true." And then the angel left her. §[Mary Visits Elizabeth] 39 A few days later Mary hurried to the hill country of Judea, to the town §40 where Zechariah lived. She entered the house and greeted Elizabeth. §41 At the sound of Mary's greeting, Elizabeth's child leaped within her, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.§42 Elizabeth gave a glad cry and exclaimed to Mary, "God has blessed you above all women, and your child is blessed. §43 Why am I so honored, that the mother of my Lord should visit me? §44 When I heard your greeting, the baby in my womb jumped for joy. §45 You are blessed because you believed that the Lord would do what he said." §[The Magnificat: Mary's Song of Praise] 46 Mary responded, "Oh, how my soul praises the Lord.§47 How my spirit rejoices in God my Savior!§48 For he took notice of his lowly servant girl, and from now on all generations will call me blessed.§49 For the Mighty One is holy, and he has done great things for me.§50 He shows mercy from generation to generation to all who fear him.§51 His mighty arm has done tremendous things! He has scattered the proud and haughty ones.§52 He has brought down princes from their thrones and exalted the humble.§53 He has filled the hungry with good things and sent the rich away with empty hands.§54 He has helped his servant Israel and remembered to be merciful.§55 For he made this promise to our ancestors, to Abraham and his children forever."§56 Mary stayed with Elizabeth about three months and then went back to her own home. §[The Birth of John the Baptist] 57 When it was time for Elizabeth's baby to be born, she gave birth to a son. §58 And when her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had been very merciful to her, everyone rejoiced with her.§59 When the baby was eight days old, they all came for the circumcision ceremony. They wanted to name him Zechariah, after his father. §60 But Elizabeth said, "No! His name is John!"§61 "What?" they exclaimed. "There is no one in all your family by that name." §62 So they used gestures to ask the baby's father what he wanted to name him. §63 He motioned for a writing tablet, and to everyone's surprise he wrote, "His name is John." §64 Instantly Zechariah could speak again, and he began praising God.§65 Awe fell upon the whole neighborhood, and the news of what had happened spread throughout the Judean hills. §66 Everyone who heard about it reflected on these events and asked, "What will this child turn out to be?" For the hand of the Lord was surely upon him in a special way. §[Zechariah's Prophecy] 67 Then his father, Zechariah, was filled with the Holy Spirit and gave this prophecy:§68 "Praise the Lord, the God of Israel, because he has visited and redeemed his people.§69 He has sent us a mighty Savior*from the royal line of his servant David,§70 just as he promised through his holy prophets long ago.§71 Now we will be saved from our enemies and from all who hate us.§72 He has been merciful to our ancestors by remembering his sacred covenant-§73 the covenant he swore with an oath to our ancestor Abraham.§74 We have been rescued from our enemies so we can serve God without fear,§75 in holiness and righteousness for as long as we live.§76 "And you, my little son, will be called the prophet of the Most High, because you will prepare the way for the Lord.§77 You will tell his people how to find salvation through forgiveness of their sins.§78 Because of God's tender mercy, the morning light from heaven is about to break upon us,*to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, and to guide us to the path of peace."§80 John grew up and became strong in spirit. And he lived in the wilderness until he began his public ministry to Israel.       §§Footnotes:§ 1:2 Greek from those who from the beginning were servants of the word.  § 1:15 Or even from birth.  § 1:17 See Mal 4:5-6.  § 1:28a Or Rejoice.  § 1:28b Some manuscripts add Blessed are you among women.  § 1:33 Greek over the house of Jacob.  § 1:37 Some manuscripts read For nothing is impossible with God.  § 1:69 Greek has raised up a horn of salvation for us.  § 1:78 Or the Morning Light from Heaven is about to visit us. 79 §
NLT/Luke 10	[Jesus Sends Out His Disciples] 1 The Lord now chose seventy-two* other disciples and sent them ahead in pairs to all the towns and places he planned to visit. §2 These were his instructions to them: "The harvest is great, but the workers are few. So pray to the Lord who is in charge of the harvest; ask him to send more workers into his fields.  §3 Now go, and remember that I am sending you out as lambs among wolves.  §4 Don't take any money with you, nor a traveler's bag, nor an extra pair of sandals. And don't stop to greet anyone on the road. §5 "Whenever you enter someone's home, first say, "May God's peace be on this house.'  §6 If those who live there are peaceful, the blessing will stand; if they are not, the blessing will return to you.  §7 Don't move around from home to home. Stay in one place, eating and drinking what they provide. Don't hesitate to accept hospitality, because those who work deserve their pay. §8 "If you enter a town and it welcomes you, eat whatever is set before you.  §9 Heal the sick, and tell them, "The Kingdom of God is near you now.'  §10 But if a town refuses to welcome you, go out into its streets and say,  §11 "We wipe even the dust of your town from our feet to show that we have abandoned you to your fate. And know this-the Kingdom of God is near!'  §12 I assure you, even wicked Sodom will be better off than such a town on judgment day. §13 "What sorrow awaits you, Korazin and Bethsaida! For if the miracles I did in you had been done in wicked Tyre and Sidon, their people would have repented of their sins long ago, clothing themselves in burlap and throwing ashes on their heads to show their remorse.  §14 Yes, Tyre and Sidon will be better off on judgment day than you.  §15 And you people of Capernaum, will you be honored in heaven? No, you will go down to the place of the dead.*" §16 Then he said to the disciples, "Anyone who accepts your message is also accepting me. And anyone who rejects you is rejecting me. And anyone who rejects me is rejecting God, who sent me." §17 When the seventy-two disciples returned, they joyfully reported to him, "Lord, even the demons obey us when we use your name!"§18 "Yes,"  he told them, "I saw Satan fall from heaven like lightning!  §19 Look, I have given you authority over all the power of the enemy, and you can walk among snakes and scorpions and crush them. Nothing will injure you.  §20 But don't rejoice because evil spirits obey you; rejoice because your names are registered in heaven."  §[Jesus' Prayer of Thanksgiving] 21 At that same time Jesus was filled with the joy of the Holy Spirit, and he said, "O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, thank you for hiding these things from those who think themselves wise and clever, and for revealing them to the childlike. Yes, Father, it pleased you to do it this way. §22 "My Father has entrusted everything to me. No one truly knows the Son except the Father, and no one truly knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him." §23 Then when they were alone, he turned to the disciples and said, "Blessed are the eyes that see what you have seen.  §24 I tell you, many prophets and kings longed to see what you see, but they didn't see it. And they longed to hear what you hear, but they didn't hear it."  §[The Most Important Commandment] 25 One day an expert in religious law stood up to test Jesus by asking him this question: "Teacher, what should I do to inherit eternal life?"§26 Jesus replied, "What does the law of Moses say? How do you read it?" §27 The man answered, ""You must love the Lord  your God with all your heart, all your soul, all your strength, and all your mind.' And, "Love your neighbor as yourself.'"*§28 "Right!"  Jesus told him. "Do this and you will live!" §29 The man wanted to justify his actions, so he asked Jesus, "And who is my neighbor?" §[Parable of the Good Samaritan] 30 Jesus replied with a story: "A Jewish man was traveling from Jerusalem down to Jericho, and he was attacked by bandits. They stripped him of his clothes, beat him up, and left him half dead beside the road. §31 "By chance a priest came along. But when he saw the man lying there, he crossed to the other side of the road and passed him by.  §32 A Temple assistant* walked over and looked at him lying there, but he also passed by on the other side. §33 "Then a despised Samaritan came along, and when he saw the man, he felt compassion for him.  §34 Going over to him, the Samaritan soothed his wounds with olive oil and wine and bandaged them. Then he put the man on his own donkey and took him to an inn, where he took care of him.  §35 The next day he handed the innkeeper two silver coins,* telling him, "Take care of this man. If his bill runs higher than this, I'll pay you the next time I'm here.' §36 "Now which of these three would you say was a neighbor to the man who was attacked by bandits?"  Jesus asked.§37 The man replied, "The one who showed him mercy." Then Jesus said, "Yes, now go and do the same."  §[Jesus Visits Martha and Mary] 38 As Jesus and the disciples continued on their way to Jerusalem, they came to a certain village where a woman named Martha welcomed him into her home. §39 Her sister, Mary, sat at the Lord's feet, listening to what he taught. §40 But Martha was distracted by the big dinner she was preparing. She came to Jesus and said, "Lord, doesn't it seem unfair to you that my sister just sits here while I do all the work? Tell her to come and help me."§41 But the Lord said to her, "My dear Martha, you are worried and upset over all these details!  §42 There is only one thing worth being concerned about. Mary has discovered it, and it will not be taken away from her."        §§Footnotes:§ 10:1 Some manuscripts read seventy; also in 10:17.  § 10:15 Greek to Hades.  § 10:27 Deut 6:5; Lev 19:18. § 10:32 Greek A Levite.  § 10:35 Greek two denarii. A denarius was equivalent to a laborer's full day's wage.  §
NLT/Luke 11	[Teaching about Prayer] 1 Once Jesus was in a certain place praying. As he finished, one of his disciples came to him and said, "Lord, teach us to pray, just as John taught his disciples."§2 Jesus said, "This is how you should pray:*"Father, may your name be kept holy.  May your Kingdom come soon. 3 Give us each day the food we need,*and forgive us our sins,  as we forgive those who sin against us.  And don't let us yield to temptation.*" 5 Then, teaching them more about prayer, he used this story: "Suppose you went to a friend's house at midnight, wanting to borrow three loaves of bread. You say to him,  §6 "A friend of mine has just arrived for a visit, and I have nothing for him to eat.'  §7 And suppose he calls out from his bedroom, "Don't bother me. The door is locked for the night, and my family and I are all in bed. I can't help you.'  §8 But I tell you this-though he won't do it for friendship's sake, if you keep knocking long enough, he will get up and give you whatever you need because of your shameless persistence.*"And so I tell you, keep on asking, and you will receive what you ask for. Keep on seeking, and you will find. Keep on knocking, and the door will be opened to you.  §10 For everyone who asks, receives. Everyone who seeks, finds. And to everyone who knocks, the door will be opened. 11 "You fathers-if your children ask* for a fish, do you give them a snake instead?  §12 Or if they ask for an egg, do you give them a scorpion? Of course not!  §13 So if you sinful people know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him."  §[Jesus and the Prince of Demons] 14 One day Jesus cast out a demon from a man who couldn't speak, and when the demon was gone, the man began to speak. The crowds were amazed, §15 but some of them said, "No wonder he can cast out demons. He gets his power from Satan,* the prince of demons." §16 Others, trying to test Jesus, demanded that he show them a miraculous sign from heaven to prove his authority.§17 He knew their thoughts, so he said, "Any kingdom divided by civil war is doomed. A family splintered by feuding will fall apart.  §18 You say I am empowered by Satan. But if Satan is divided and fighting against himself, how can his kingdom survive?  §19 And if I am empowered by Satan, what about your own exorcists? They cast out demons, too, so they will condemn you for what you have said.  §20 But if I am casting out demons by the power of God,* then the Kingdom of God has arrived among you.  §21 For when a strong man is fully armed and guards his palace, his possessions are safe- 22 until someone even stronger attacks and overpowers him, strips him of his weapons, and carries off his belongings. 23 "Anyone who isn't with me opposes me, and anyone who isn't working with me is actually working against me. 24 "When an evil* spirit leaves a person, it goes into the desert, searching for rest. But when it finds none, it says, "I will return to the person I came from.'  §25 So it returns and finds that its former home is all swept and in order.  §26 Then the spirit finds seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they all enter the person and live there. And so that person is worse off than before." 27 As he was speaking, a woman in the crowd called out, "God bless your mother-the womb from which you came, and the breasts that nursed you!"§28 Jesus replied, "But even more blessed are all who hear the word of God and put it into practice."  §[The Sign of Jonah] 29 As the crowd pressed in on Jesus, he said, "This evil generation keeps asking me to show them a miraculous sign. But the only sign I will give them is the sign of Jonah.  §30 What happened to him was a sign to the people of Nineveh that God had sent him. What happens to the Son of Man* will be a sign to these people that he was sent by God. 31 "The queen of Sheba* will stand up against this generation on judgment day and condemn it, for she came from a distant land to hear the wisdom of Solomon. Now someone greater than Solomon is here-but you refuse to listen.  §32 The people of Nineveh will also stand up against this generation on judgment day and condemn it, for they repented of their sins at the preaching of Jonah. Now someone greater than Jonah is here-but you refuse to repent.  §[Receiving the Light] 33 "No one lights a lamp and then hides it or puts it under a basket.* Instead, a lamp is placed on a stand, where its light can be seen by all who enter the house. 34 "Your eye is like a lamp that provides light for your body. When your eye is healthy, your whole body is filled with light. But when it is unhealthy, your body is filled with darkness.  §35 Make sure that the light you think you have is not actually darkness.  §36 If you are filled with light, with no dark corners, then your whole life will be radiant, as though a floodlight were filling you with light."  §[Jesus Criticizes the Religious Leaders] 37 As Jesus was speaking, one of the Pharisees invited him home for a meal. So he went in and took his place at the table.* §38 His host was amazed to see that he sat down to eat without first performing the hand-washing ceremony required by Jewish custom. §39 Then the Lord said to him, "You Pharisees are so careful to clean the outside of the cup and the dish, but inside you are filthy-full of greed and wickedness!  §40 Fools! Didn't God make the inside as well as the outside?  §41 So clean the inside by giving gifts to the poor, and you will be clean all over. 42 "What sorrow awaits you Pharisees! For you are careful to tithe even the tiniest income from your herb gardens,* but you ignore justice and the love of God. You should tithe, yes, but do not neglect the more important things. 43 "What sorrow awaits you Pharisees! For you love to sit in the seats of honor in the synagogues and receive respectful greetings as you walk in the marketplaces.  §44 Yes, what sorrow awaits you! For you are like hidden graves in a field. People walk over them without knowing the corruption they are stepping on." 45 "Teacher," said an expert in religious law, "you have insulted us, too, in what you just said."§46 "Yes,"  said Jesus, "what sorrow also awaits you experts in religious law! For you crush people with unbearable religious demands, and you never lift a finger to ease the burden.  §47 What sorrow awaits you! For you build monuments for the prophets your own ancestors killed long ago.  §48 But in fact, you stand as witnesses who agree with what your ancestors did. They killed the prophets, and you join in their crime by building the monuments!  §49 This is what God in his wisdom said about you:* "I will send prophets and apostles to them, but they will kill some and persecute the others.' 50 "As a result, this generation will be held responsible for the murder of all God's prophets from the creation of the world- 51 from the murder of Abel to the murder of Zechariah, who was killed between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, it will certainly be charged against this generation. 52 "What sorrow awaits you experts in religious law! For you remove the key to knowledge from the people. You don't enter the Kingdom yourselves, and you prevent others from entering." 53 As Jesus was leaving, the teachers of religious law and the Pharisees became hostile and tried to provoke him with many questions. §54 They wanted to trap him into saying something they could use against him.       §§Footnotes:§ 11:2 Some manuscripts add additional phrases from the Lord's Prayer as it reads in Matt 6:9-13.   § 11:3 Or Give us each day our food for the day; or Give us each day our food for tomorrow.  4 § 11:4 Or And keep us from being tested.  § 11:8 Or in order to avoid shame, or so his reputation won't be damaged.  9 § 11:11 Some manuscripts add for bread, do you give them a stone? Or [if they ask].  § 11:15 Greek Beelzeboul; also in 11:18, 19. Other manuscripts read Beezeboul; Latin version reads Beelzebub.  § 11:20 Greek by the finger of God.  § 11:24 Greek unclean.  § 11:30 "Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself.  § 11:31 Greek The queen of the south.  § 11:33 Some manuscripts do not include or puts it under a basket.  § 11:37 Or and reclined.  § 11:42 Greek tithe the mint, the rue, and every herb.  § 11:49 Greek Therefore, the wisdom of God said.  §
NLT/Luke 12	[A Warning against Hypocrisy] 1 Meanwhile, the crowds grew until thousands were milling about and stepping on each other. Jesus turned first to his disciples and warned them, "Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees-their hypocrisy.  §2 The time is coming when everything that is covered up will be revealed, and all that is secret will be made known to all.  §3 Whatever you have said in the dark will be heard in the light, and what you have whispered behind closed doors will be shouted from the housetops for all to hear! 4 "Dear friends, don't be afraid of those who want to kill your body; they cannot do any more to you after that.  §5 But I'll tell you whom to fear. Fear God, who has the power to kill you and then throw you into hell.* Yes, he's the one to fear. 6 "What is the price of five sparrows-two copper coins*? Yet God does not forget a single one of them.  §7 And the very hairs on your head are all numbered. So don't be afraid; you are more valuable to God than a whole flock of sparrows. 8 "I tell you the truth, everyone who acknowledges me publicly here on earth, the Son of Man* will also acknowledge in the presence of God's angels.  §9 But anyone who denies me here on earth will be denied before God's angels.  §10 Anyone who speaks against the Son of Man can be forgiven, but anyone who blasphemes the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven. 11 "And when you are brought to trial in the synagogues and before rulers and authorities, don't worry about how to defend yourself or what to say,  §12 for the Holy Spirit will teach you at that time what needs to be said."  §[Parable of the Rich Fool] 13 Then someone called from the crowd, "Teacher, please tell my brother to divide our father's estate with me."§14 Jesus replied, "Friend, who made me a judge over you to decide such things as that?"  §15 Then he said, "Beware! Guard against every kind of greed. Life is not measured by how much you own." 16 Then he told them a story: "A rich man had a fertile farm that produced fine crops.  §17 He said to himself, "What should I do? I don't have room for all my crops.'  §18 Then he said, "I know! I'll tear down my barns and build bigger ones. Then I'll have room enough to store all my wheat and other goods.  §19 And I'll sit back and say to myself, "My friend, you have enough stored away for years to come. Now take it easy! Eat, drink, and be merry!"' 20 "But God said to him, "You fool! You will die this very night. Then who will get everything you worked for?' 21 "Yes, a person is a fool to store up earthly wealth but not have a rich relationship with God."  §[Teaching about Money and Possessions] 22 Then, turning to his disciples, Jesus said, "That is why I tell you not to worry about everyday life-whether you have enough food to eat or enough clothes to wear.  §23 For life is more than food, and your body more than clothing.  §24 Look at the ravens. They don't plant or harvest or store food in barns, for God feeds them. And you are far more valuable to him than any birds!  §25 Can all your worries add a single moment to your life?  §26 And if worry can't accomplish a little thing like that, what's the use of worrying over bigger things? 27 "Look at the lilies and how they grow. They don't work or make their clothing, yet Solomon in all his glory was not dressed as beautifully as they are.  §28 And if God cares so wonderfully for flowers that are here today and thrown into the fire tomorrow, he will certainly care for you. Why do you have so little faith? 29 "And don't be concerned about what to eat and what to drink. Don't worry about such things.  §30 These things dominate the thoughts of unbelievers all over the world, but your Father already knows your needs.  §31 Seek the Kingdom of God above all else, and he will give you everything you need. 32 "So don't be afraid, little flock. For it gives your Father great happiness to give you the Kingdom. 33 "Sell your possessions and give to those in need. This will store up treasure for you in heaven! And the purses of heaven never get old or develop holes. Your treasure will be safe; no thief can steal it and no moth can destroy it.  §34 Wherever your treasure is, there the desires of your heart will also be.  §[Be Ready for the Lord's Coming] 35 "Be dressed for service and keep your lamps burning,  §36 as though you were waiting for your master to return from the wedding feast. Then you will be ready to open the door and let him in the moment he arrives and knocks.  §37 The servants who are ready and waiting for his return will be rewarded. I tell you the truth, he himself will seat them, put on an apron, and serve them as they sit and eat!  §38 He may come in the middle of the night or just before dawn.* But whenever he comes, he will reward the servants who are ready. 39 "Understand this: If a homeowner knew exactly when a burglar was coming, he would not permit his house to be broken into.  §40 You also must be ready all the time, for the Son of Man will come when least expected." 41 Peter asked, "Lord, is that illustration just for us or for everyone?"§42 And the Lord replied, "A faithful, sensible servant is one to whom the master can give the responsibility of managing his other household servants and feeding them.  §43 If the master returns and finds that the servant has done a good job, there will be a reward.  §44 I tell you the truth, the master will put that servant in charge of all he owns.  §45 But what if the servant thinks, "My master won't be back for a while,' and he begins beating the other servants, partying, and getting drunk?  §46 The master will return unannounced and unexpected, and he will cut the servant in pieces and banish him with the unfaithful. 47 "And a servant who knows what the master wants, but isn't prepared and doesn't carry out those instructions, will be severely punished.  §48 But someone who does not know, and then does something wrong, will be punished only lightly. When someone has been given much, much will be required in return; and when someone has been entrusted with much, even more will be required.  §[Jesus Causes Division] 49 "I have come to set the world on fire, and I wish it were already burning!  §50 I have a terrible baptism of suffering ahead of me, and I am under a heavy burden until it is accomplished.  §51 Do you think I have come to bring peace to the earth? No, I have come to divide people against each other!  §52 From now on families will be split apart, three in favor of me, and two against-or two in favor and three against. 53 "Father will be divided against son  and son against father;  mother against daughter  and daughter against mother;  and mother-in-law against daughter-in-law  and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.'*" 54 Then Jesus turned to the crowd and said, "When you see clouds beginning to form in the west, you say, "Here comes a shower.' And you are right.  §55 When the south wind blows, you say, "Today will be a scorcher.' And it is.  §56 You fools! You know how to interpret the weather signs of the earth and sky, but you don't know how to interpret the present times. 57 "Why can't you decide for yourselves what is right?  §58 When you are on the way to court with your accuser, try to settle the matter before you get there. Otherwise, your accuser may drag you before the judge, who will hand you over to an officer, who will throw you into prison.  §59 And if that happens, you won't be free again until you have paid the very last penny.*"        §§Footnotes:§ 12:5 Greek Gehenna.  § 12:6 Greek two assaria [Roman coins equal to 1 16 of a denarius].  § 12:8 "Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself.  § 12:38 Greek in the second or third watch.  § 12:53 Mic 7:6.  § 12:59 Greek last lepton [the smallest Jewish coin].  §
NLT/Luke 13	[A Call to Repentance] 1 About this time Jesus was informed that Pilate had murdered some people from Galilee as they were offering sacrifices at the Temple. §2 "Do you think those Galileans were worse sinners than all the other people from Galilee?"  Jesus asked. "Is that why they suffered?  §3 Not at all! And you will perish, too, unless you repent of your sins and turn to God.  §4 And what about the eighteen people who died when the tower in Siloam fell on them? Were they the worst sinners in Jerusalem?  §5 No, and I tell you again that unless you repent, you will perish, too."  §[Parable of the Barren Fig Tree] 6 Then Jesus told this story: "A man planted a fig tree in his garden and came again and again to see if there was any fruit on it, but he was always disappointed.  §7 Finally, he said to his gardener, "I've waited three years, and there hasn't been a single fig! Cut it down. It's just taking up space in the garden.' 8 "The gardener answered, "Sir, give it one more chance. Leave it another year, and I'll give it special attention and plenty of fertilizer.  §9 If we get figs next year, fine. If not, then you can cut it down.'"  §[Jesus Heals on the Sabbath] 10 One Sabbath day as Jesus was teaching in a synagogue, §11 he saw a woman who had been crippled by an evil spirit. She had been bent double for eighteen years and was unable to stand up straight. §12 When Jesus saw her, he called her over and said, "Dear woman, you are healed of your sickness!"  §13 Then he touched her, and instantly she could stand straight. How she praised God!§14 But the leader in charge of the synagogue was indignant that Jesus had healed her on the Sabbath day. "There are six days of the week for working," he said to the crowd. "Come on those days to be healed, not on the Sabbath."§15 But the Lord replied, "You hypocrites! Each of you works on the Sabbath day! Don't you untie your ox or your donkey from its stall on the Sabbath and lead it out for water?  §16 This dear woman, a daughter of Abraham, has been held in bondage by Satan for eighteen years. Isn't it right that she be released, even on the Sabbath?" 17 This shamed his enemies, but all the people rejoiced at the wonderful things he did. §[Parable of the Mustard Seed] 18 Then Jesus said, "What is the Kingdom of God like? How can I illustrate it?  §19 It is like a tiny mustard seed that a man planted in a garden; it grows and becomes a tree, and the birds make nests in its branches."  §[Parable of the Yeast] 20 He also asked, "What else is the Kingdom of God like?  §21 It is like the yeast a woman used in making bread. Even though she put only a little yeast in three measures of flour, it permeated every part of the dough."  §[The Narrow Door] 22 Jesus went through the towns and villages, teaching as he went, always pressing on toward Jerusalem. §23 Someone asked him, "Lord, will only a few be saved?" He replied, §24 "Work hard to enter the narrow door to God's Kingdom, for many will try to enter but will fail.  §25 When the master of the house has locked the door, it will be too late. You will stand outside knocking and pleading, "Lord, open the door for us!' But he will reply, "I don't know you or where you come from.'  §26 Then you will say, "But we ate and drank with you, and you taught in our streets.'  §27 And he will reply, "I tell you, I don't know you or where you come from. Get away from me, all you who do evil.' 28 "There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, for you will see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the prophets in the Kingdom of God, but you will be thrown out.  §29 And people will come from all over the world-from east and west, north and south-to take their places in the Kingdom of God.  §30 And note this: Some who seem least important now will be the greatest then, and some who are the greatest now will be least important then.*"  §[Jesus Grieves over Jerusalem] 31 At that time some Pharisees said to him, "Get away from here if you want to live! Herod Antipas wants to kill you!"§32 Jesus replied, "Go tell that fox that I will keep on casting out demons and healing people today and tomorrow; and the third day I will accomplish my purpose.  §33 Yes, today, tomorrow, and the next day I must proceed on my way. For it wouldn't do for a prophet of God to be killed except in Jerusalem! 34 "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that kills the prophets and stones God's messengers! How often I have wanted to gather your children together as a hen protects her chicks beneath her wings, but you wouldn't let me.  §35 And now, look, your house is abandoned. And you will never see me again until you say, "Blessings on the one who comes in the name of the  Lord  !'*"        §§Footnotes:§ 13:30 Greek Some are last who will be first, and some are first who will be last.  § 13:35 Ps 118:26.  §
NLT/Luke 14	[Jesus Heals on the Sabbath] 1 One Sabbath day Jesus went to eat dinner in the home of a leader of the Pharisees, and the people were watching him closely. §2 There was a man there whose arms and legs were swollen.* §3 Jesus asked the Pharisees and experts in religious law, "Is it permitted in the law to heal people on the Sabbath day, or not?"  §4 When they refused to answer, Jesus touched the sick man and healed him and sent him away. §5 Then he turned to them and said, "Which of you doesn't work on the Sabbath? If your son* or your cow falls into a pit, don't you rush to get him out?"  §6 Again they could not answer. §[Jesus Teaches about Humility] 7 When Jesus noticed that all who had come to the dinner were trying to sit in the seats of honor near the head of the table, he gave them this advice: §8 "When you are invited to a wedding feast, don't sit in the seat of honor. What if someone who is more distinguished than you has also been invited?  §9 The host will come and say, "Give this person your seat.' Then you will be embarrassed, and you will have to take whatever seat is left at the foot of the table! 10 "Instead, take the lowest place at the foot of the table. Then when your host sees you, he will come and say, "Friend, we have a better place for you!' Then you will be honored in front of all the other guests.  §11 For those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted." 12 Then he turned to his host. "When you put on a luncheon or a banquet,"  he said, "don't invite your friends, brothers, relatives, and rich neighbors. For they will invite you back, and that will be your only reward.  §13 Instead, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind.  §14 Then at the resurrection of the righteous, God will reward you for inviting those who could not repay you."  §[Parable of the Great Feast] 15 Hearing this, a man sitting at the table with Jesus exclaimed, "What a blessing it will be to attend a banquet* in the Kingdom of God!"§16 Jesus replied with this story: "A man prepared a great feast and sent out many invitations.  §17 When the banquet was ready, he sent his servant to tell the guests, "Come, the banquet is ready.'  §18 But they all began making excuses. One said, "I have just bought a field and must inspect it. Please excuse me.'  §19 Another said, "I have just bought five pairs of oxen, and I want to try them out. Please excuse me.'  §20 Another said, "I just got married, so I can't come.' 21 "The servant returned and told his master what they had said. His master was furious and said, "Go quickly into the streets and alleys of the town and invite the poor, the crippled, the blind, and the lame.'  §22 After the servant had done this, he reported, "There is still room for more.'  §23 So his master said, "Go out into the country lanes and behind the hedges and urge anyone you find to come, so that the house will be full.  §24 For none of those I first invited will get even the smallest taste of my banquet.'"  §[The Cost of Being a Disciple] 25 A large crowd was following Jesus. He turned around and said to them, §26 "If you want to be my disciple, you must, by comparison, hate everyone else-your father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters-yes, even your own life. Otherwise, you cannot be my disciple.  §27 And if you do not carry your own cross and follow me, you cannot be my disciple. 28 "But don't begin until you count the cost. For who would begin construction of a building without first calculating the cost to see if there is enough money to finish it?  §29 Otherwise, you might complete only the foundation before running out of money, and then everyone would laugh at you.  §30 They would say, "There's the person who started that building and couldn't afford to finish it!' 31 "Or what king would go to war against another king without first sitting down with his counselors to discuss whether his army of 10,000 could defeat the 20,000 soldiers marching against him?  §32 And if he can't, he will send a delegation to discuss terms of peace while the enemy is still far away.  §33 So you cannot become my disciple without giving up everything you own. 34 "Salt is good for seasoning. But if it loses its flavor, how do you make it salty again?  §35 Flavorless salt is good neither for the soil nor for the manure pile. It is thrown away. Anyone with ears to hear should listen and understand!"        §§Footnotes:§ 14:2 Or who had dropsy.  § 14:5 Some manuscripts read donkey.  § 14:15 Greek to eat bread.  §
NLT/Luke 15	[Parable of the Lost Sheep] 1 Tax collectors and other notorious sinners often came to listen to Jesus teach. §2 This made the Pharisees and teachers of religious law complain that he was associating with such sinful people-even eating with them!§3 So Jesus told them this story: §4 "If a man has a hundred sheep and one of them gets lost, what will he do? Won't he leave the ninety-nine others in the wilderness and go to search for the one that is lost until he finds it?  §5 And when he has found it, he will joyfully carry it home on his shoulders.  §6 When he arrives, he will call together his friends and neighbors, saying, "Rejoice with me because I have found my lost sheep.'  §7 In the same way, there is more joy in heaven over one lost sinner who repents and returns to God than over ninety-nine others who are righteous and haven't strayed away!  §[Parable of the Lost Coin] 8 "Or suppose a woman has ten silver coins* and loses one. Won't she light a lamp and sweep the entire house and search carefully until she finds it?  §9 And when she finds it, she will call in her friends and neighbors and say, "Rejoice with me because I have found my lost coin.'  §10 In the same way, there is joy in the presence of God's angels when even one sinner repents."  §[Parable of the Lost Son] 11 To illustrate the point further, Jesus told them this story: "A man had two sons.  §12 The younger son told his father, "I want my share of your estate now before you die.' So his father agreed to divide his wealth between his sons. 13 "A few days later this younger son packed all his belongings and moved to a distant land, and there he wasted all his money in wild living.  §14 About the time his money ran out, a great famine swept over the land, and he began to starve.  §15 He persuaded a local farmer to hire him, and the man sent him into his fields to feed the pigs.  §16 The young man became so hungry that even the pods he was feeding the pigs looked good to him. But no one gave him anything. 17 "When he finally came to his senses, he said to himself, "At home even the hired servants have food enough to spare, and here I am dying of hunger!  §18 I will go home to my father and say, "Father, I have sinned against both heaven and you,  §19 and I am no longer worthy of being called your son. Please take me on as a hired servant."' 20 "So he returned home to his father. And while he was still a long way off, his father saw him coming. Filled with love and compassion, he ran to his son, embraced him, and kissed him.  §21 His son said to him, "Father, I have sinned against both heaven and you, and I am no longer worthy of being called your son.*' 22 "But his father said to the servants, "Quick! Bring the finest robe in the house and put it on him. Get a ring for his finger and sandals for his feet.  §23 And kill the calf we have been fattening. We must celebrate with a feast,  §24 for this son of mine was dead and has now returned to life. He was lost, but now he is found.' So the party began. 25 "Meanwhile, the older son was in the fields working. When he returned home, he heard music and dancing in the house,  §26 and he asked one of the servants what was going on.  §27 "Your brother is back,' he was told, "and your father has killed the fattened calf. We are celebrating because of his safe return.' 28 "The older brother was angry and wouldn't go in. His father came out and begged him,  §29 but he replied, "All these years I've slaved for you and never once refused to do a single thing you told me to. And in all that time you never gave me even one young goat for a feast with my friends.  §30 Yet when this son of yours comes back after squandering your money on prostitutes, you celebrate by killing the fattened calf!' 31 "His father said to him, "Look, dear son, you have always stayed by me, and everything I have is yours.  §32 We had to celebrate this happy day. For your brother was dead and has come back to life! He was lost, but now he is found!'"        §§Footnotes:§ 15:8 Greek ten drachmas. A drachma was the equivalent of a full day's wage.  § 15:21 Some manuscripts add Please take me on as a hired servant.  §
NLT/Luke 16	[Parable of the Shrewd Manager] 1 Jesus told this story to his disciples: "There was a certain rich man who had a manager handling his affairs. One day a report came that the manager was wasting his employer's money.  §2 So the employer called him in and said, "What's this I hear about you? Get your report in order, because you are going to be fired.' 3 "The manager thought to himself, "Now what? My boss has fired me. I don't have the strength to dig ditches, and I'm too proud to beg.  §4 Ah, I know how to ensure that I'll have plenty of friends who will give me a home when I am fired.' 5 "So he invited each person who owed money to his employer to come and discuss the situation. He asked the first one, "How much do you owe him?'  §6 The man replied, "I owe him 800 gallons of olive oil.' So the manager told him, "Take the bill and quickly change it to 400 gallons.*' 7 ""And how much do you owe my employer?' he asked the next man. "I owe him 1,000 bushels of wheat,' was the reply. "Here,' the manager said, "take the bill and change it to 800 bushels.*' 8 "The rich man had to admire the dishonest rascal for being so shrewd. And it is true that the children of this world are more shrewd in dealing with the world around them than are the children of the light.  §9 Here's the lesson: Use your worldly resources to benefit others and make friends. Then, when your possessions are gone, they will welcome you to an eternal home.*"If you are faithful in little things, you will be faithful in large ones. But if you are dishonest in little things, you won't be honest with greater responsibilities.  §11 And if you are untrustworthy about worldly wealth, who will trust you with the true riches of heaven?  §12 And if you are not faithful with other people's things, why should you be trusted with things of your own? 13 "No one can serve two masters. For you will hate one and love the other; you will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and be enslaved to money." 14 The Pharisees, who dearly loved their money, heard all this and scoffed at him. §15 Then he said to them, "You like to appear righteous in public, but God knows your hearts. What this world honors is detestable in the sight of God. 16 "Until John the Baptist, the law of Moses and the messages of the prophets were your guides. But now the Good News of the Kingdom of God is preached, and everyone is eager to get in.* §17 But that doesn't mean that the law has lost its force. It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the smallest point of God's law to be overturned. 18 "For example, a man who divorces his wife and marries someone else commits adultery. And anyone who marries a woman divorced from her husband commits adultery."  §[Parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus] 19 Jesus said, "There was a certain rich man who was splendidly clothed in purple and fine linen and who lived each day in luxury.  §20 At his gate lay a poor man named Lazarus who was covered with sores.  §21 As Lazarus lay there longing for scraps from the rich man's table, the dogs would come and lick his open sores. 22 "Finally, the poor man died and was carried by the angels to sit beside Abraham at the heavenly banquet.* The rich man also died and was buried,  §23 and he went to the place of the dead.* There, in torment, he saw Abraham in the far distance with Lazarus at his side. 24 "The rich man shouted, "Father Abraham, have some pity! Send Lazarus over here to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue. I am in anguish in these flames.' 25 "But Abraham said to him, "Son, remember that during your lifetime you had everything you wanted, and Lazarus had nothing. So now he is here being comforted, and you are in anguish.  §26 And besides, there is a great chasm separating us. No one can cross over to you from here, and no one can cross over to us from there.' 27 "Then the rich man said, "Please, Father Abraham, at least send him to my father's home.  §28 For I have five brothers, and I want him to warn them so they don't end up in this place of torment.' §29 "But Abraham said, "Moses and the prophets have warned them. Your brothers can read what they wrote.' §30 "The rich man replied, "No, Father Abraham! But if someone is sent to them from the dead, then they will repent of their sins and turn to God.' §31 "But Abraham said, "If they won't listen to Moses and the prophets, they won't be persuaded even if someone rises from the dead.'"        §§Footnotes:§ 16:6 Greek 100 baths . . . 50 [baths].  § 16:7 Greek 100 korous . . . 80 [korous].  § 16:9 Or you will be welcomed into eternal homes.  10 § 16:16 Or everyone is urged to enter in.  § 16:22 Greek to Abraham's bosom.  § 16:23 Greek to Hades.  §
NLT/Luke 17	[Teachings about Forgiveness and Faith] 1 One day Jesus said to his disciples, "There will always be temptations to sin, but what sorrow awaits the person who does the tempting!  §2 It would be better to be thrown into the sea with a millstone hung around your neck than to cause one of these little ones to fall into sin.  §3 So watch yourselves!  "If another believer* sins, rebuke that person; then if there is repentance, forgive.  §4 Even if that person wrongs you seven times a day and each time turns again and asks forgiveness, you must forgive." 5 The apostles said to the Lord, "Show us how to increase our faith."§6 The Lord answered, "If you had faith even as small as a mustard seed, you could say to this mulberry tree, "May you be uprooted and be planted in the sea,' and it would obey you! 7 "When a servant comes in from plowing or taking care of sheep, does his master say, "Come in and eat with me'?  §8 No, he says, "Prepare my meal, put on your apron, and serve me while I eat. Then you can eat later.'  §9 And does the master thank the servant for doing what he was told to do? Of course not.  §10 In the same way, when you obey me you should say, "We are unworthy servants who have simply done our duty.'"  §[Ten Healed of Leprosy] 11 As Jesus continued on toward Jerusalem, he reached the border between Galilee and Samaria. §12 As he entered a village there, ten men with leprosy stood at a distance, §13 crying out, "Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!"§14 He looked at them and said, "Go show yourselves to the priests."* And as they went, they were cleansed of their leprosy.§15 One of them, when he saw that he was healed, came back to Jesus, shouting, "Praise God!" §16 He fell to the ground at Jesus' feet, thanking him for what he had done. This man was a Samaritan.§17 Jesus asked, "Didn't I heal ten men? Where are the other nine?  §18 Has no one returned to give glory to God except this foreigner?"  §19 And Jesus said to the man, "Stand up and go. Your faith has healed you.*"  §[The Coming of the Kingdom] 20 One day the Pharisees asked Jesus, "When will the Kingdom of God come?" Jesus replied, "The Kingdom of God can't be detected by visible signs.* §21 You won't be able to say, "Here it is!' or "It's over there!' For the Kingdom of God is already among you.*" 22 Then he said to his disciples, "The time is coming when you will long to see the day when the Son of Man returns,* but you won't see it.  §23 People will tell you, "Look, there is the Son of Man,' or "Here he is,' but don't go out and follow them.  §24 For as the lightning flashes and lights up the sky from one end to the other, so it will be on the day* when the Son of Man comes.  §25 But first the Son of Man must suffer terribly* and be rejected by this generation. 26 "When the Son of Man returns, it will be like it was in Noah's day.  §27 In those days, the people enjoyed banquets and parties and weddings right up to the time Noah entered his boat and the flood came and destroyed them all. 28 "And the world will be as it was in the days of Lot. People went about their daily business-eating and drinking, buying and selling, farming and building- 29 until the morning Lot left Sodom. Then fire and burning sulfur rained down from heaven and destroyed them all.  §30 Yes, it will be "business as usual' right up to the day when the Son of Man is revealed.  §31 On that day a person out on the deck of a roof must not go down into the house to pack. A person out in the field must not return home.  §32 Remember what happened to Lot's wife!  §33 If you cling to your life, you will lose it, and if you let your life go, you will save it.  §34 That night two people will be asleep in one bed; one will be taken, the other left.  §35 Two women will be grinding flour together at the mill; one will be taken, the other left.*" §37 "Where will this happen, Lord?"* the disciples asked. Jesus replied, "Just as the gathering of vultures shows there is a carcass nearby, so these signs indicate that the end is near."*§§Footnotes:§ 17:3 Greek If your brother.  § 17:14 See Lev 14:2-32.  § 17:19 Or Your faith has saved you.  § 17:20 Or by your speculations.  § 17:21 Or is within you, or is in your grasp.  § 17:22 Or long for even one day with the Son of Man.

NLT/Luke 18	[Parable of the Persistent Widow] 1 One day Jesus told his disciples a story to show that they should always pray and never give up. §2 "There was a judge in a certain city,"  he said, "who neither feared God nor cared about people.  §3 A widow of that city came to him repeatedly, saying, "Give me justice in this dispute with my enemy.'  §4 The judge ignored her for a while, but finally he said to himself, "I don't fear God or care about people,  §5 but this woman is driving me crazy. I'm going to see that she gets justice, because she is wearing me out with her constant requests!'" 6 Then the Lord said, "Learn a lesson from this unjust judge.  §7 Even he rendered a just decision in the end. So don't you think God will surely give justice to his chosen people who cry out to him day and night? Will he keep putting them off?  §8 I tell you, he will grant justice to them quickly! But when the Son of Man* returns, how many will he find on the earth who have faith?"  §[Parable of the Pharisee and Tax Collector] 9 Then Jesus told this story to some who had great confidence in their own righteousness and scorned everyone else: §10 "Two men went to the Temple to pray. One was a Pharisee, and the other was a despised tax collector.  §11 The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed this prayer*: "I thank you, God, that I am not like other people-cheaters, sinners, adulterers. I'm certainly not like that tax collector!  §12 I fast twice a week, and I give you a tenth of my income.' 13 "But the tax collector stood at a distance and dared not even lift his eyes to heaven as he prayed. Instead, he beat his chest in sorrow, saying, "O God, be merciful to me, for I am a sinner.'  §14 I tell you, this sinner, not the Pharisee, returned home justified before God. For those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted."  §[Jesus Blesses the Children] 15 One day some parents brought their little children to Jesus so he could touch and bless them. But when the disciples saw this, they scolded the parents for bothering him.§16 Then Jesus called for the children and said to the disciples, "Let the children come to me. Don't stop them! For the Kingdom of God belongs to those who are like these children.  §17 I tell you the truth, anyone who doesn't receive the Kingdom of God like a child will never enter it."  §[The Rich Man] 18 Once a religious leader asked Jesus this question: "Good Teacher, what should I do to inherit eternal life?"§19 "Why do you call me good?"  Jesus asked him. "Only God is truly good.  §20 But to answer your question, you know the commandments: "You must not commit adultery. You must not murder. You must not steal. You must not testify falsely. Honor your father and mother.'*" 21 The man replied, "I've obeyed all these commandments since I was young."§22 When Jesus heard his answer, he said, "There is still one thing you haven't done. Sell all your possessions and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me." 23 But when the man heard this he became very sad, for he was very rich.§24 When Jesus saw this,* he said, "How hard it is for the rich to enter the Kingdom of God!  §25 In fact, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the Kingdom of God!" 26 Those who heard this said, "Then who in the world can be saved?"§27 He replied, "What is impossible for people is possible with God." 28 Peter said, "We've left our homes to follow you."§29 "Yes,"  Jesus replied, "and I assure you that everyone who has given up house or wife or brothers or parents or children, for the sake of the Kingdom of God,  §30 will be repaid many times over in this life, and will have eternal life in the world to come."  §[Jesus Again Predicts His Death] 31 Taking the twelve disciples aside, Jesus said, "Listen, we're going up to Jerusalem, where all the predictions of the prophets concerning the Son of Man will come true.  §32 He will be handed over to the Romans,* and he will be mocked, treated shamefully, and spit upon.  §33 They will flog him with a whip and kill him, but on the third day he will rise again." 34 But they didn't understand any of this. The significance of his words was hidden from them, and they failed to grasp what he was talking about. §[Jesus Heals a Blind Beggar] 35 As Jesus approached Jericho, a blind beggar was sitting beside the road. §36 When he heard the noise of a crowd going past, he asked what was happening. §37 They told him that Jesus the Nazarene* was going by. §38 So he began shouting, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!"§39 "Be quiet!" the people in front yelled at him. But he only shouted louder, "Son of David, have mercy on me!"§40 When Jesus heard him, he stopped and ordered that the man be brought to him. As the man came near, Jesus asked him, §41 "What do you want me to do for you?"  "Lord," he said, "I want to see!"§42 And Jesus said, "All right, receive your sight! Your faith has healed you."  §43 Instantly the man could see, and he followed Jesus, praising God. And all who saw it praised God, too.       §§Footnotes:§ 18:8 "Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself.  § 18:11 Some manuscripts read stood and prayed this prayer to himself.  § 18:20 Exod 20:12-16; Deut 5:16-20.  § 18:24 Some manuscripts read When Jesus saw how sad the man was.  § 18:32 Greek the Gentiles.  § 18:37 Or Jesus of Nazareth.  §
NLT/Luke 19	[Jesus and Zacchaeus] 1 Jesus entered Jericho and made his way through the town. §2 There was a man there named Zacchaeus. He was the chief tax collector in the region, and he had become very rich. §3 He tried to get a look at Jesus, but he was too short to see over the crowd. §4 So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore-fig tree beside the road, for Jesus was going to pass that way.§5 When Jesus came by, he looked up at Zacchaeus and called him by name. "Zacchaeus!"  he said. "Quick, come down! I must be a guest in your home today." 6 Zacchaeus quickly climbed down and took Jesus to his house in great excitement and joy. §7 But the people were displeased. "He has gone to be the guest of a notorious sinner," they grumbled.§8 Meanwhile, Zacchaeus stood before the Lord and said, "I will give half my wealth to the poor, Lord, and if I have cheated people on their taxes, I will give them back four times as much!"§9 Jesus responded, "Salvation has come to this home today, for this man has shown himself to be a true son of Abraham.  §10 For the Son of Man* came to seek and save those who are lost."  §[Parable of the Ten Servants] 11 The crowd was listening to everything Jesus said. And because he was nearing Jerusalem, he told them a story to correct the impression that the Kingdom of God would begin right away. §12 He said, "A nobleman was called away to a distant empire to be crowned king and then return.  §13 Before he left, he called together ten of his servants and divided among them ten pounds of silver,* saying, "Invest this for me while I am gone.'  §14 But his people hated him and sent a delegation after him to say, "We do not want him to be our king.' 15 "After he was crowned king, he returned and called in the servants to whom he had given the money. He wanted to find out what their profits were.  §16 The first servant reported, "Master, I invested your money and made ten times the original amount!' 17 ""Well done!' the king exclaimed. "You are a good servant. You have been faithful with the little I entrusted to you, so you will be governor of ten cities as your reward.' 18 "The next servant reported, "Master, I invested your money and made five times the original amount.' 19 ""Well done!' the king said. "You will be governor over five cities.' 20 "But the third servant brought back only the original amount of money and said, "Master, I hid your money and kept it safe.  §21 I was afraid because you are a hard man to deal with, taking what isn't yours and harvesting crops you didn't plant.' 22 ""You wicked servant!' the king roared. "Your own words condemn you. If you knew that I'm a hard man who takes what isn't mine and harvests crops I didn't plant,  §23 why didn't you deposit my money in the bank? At least I could have gotten some interest on it.' 24 "Then, turning to the others standing nearby, the king ordered, "Take the money from this servant, and give it to the one who has ten pounds.' 25 ""But, master,' they said, "he already has ten pounds!' 26 ""Yes,' the king replied, "and to those who use well what they are given, even more will be given. But from those who do nothing, even what little they have will be taken away.  §27 And as for these enemies of mine who didn't want me to be their king-bring them in and execute them right here in front of me.'"  §[Jesus' Triumphant Entry] 28 After telling this story, Jesus went on toward Jerusalem, walking ahead of his disciples. §29 As he came to the towns of Bethphage and Bethany on the Mount of Olives, he sent two disciples ahead. §30 "Go into that village over there,"  he told them. "As you enter it, you will see a young donkey tied there that no one has ever ridden. Untie it and bring it here.  §31 If anyone asks, "Why are you untying that colt?' just say, "The Lord needs it.'" 32 So they went and found the colt, just as Jesus had said. §33 And sure enough, as they were untying it, the owners asked them, "Why are you untying that colt?"§34 And the disciples simply replied, "The Lord needs it." §35 So they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their garments over it for him to ride on.§36 As he rode along, the crowds spread out their garments on the road ahead of him. §37 When he reached the place where the road started down the Mount of Olives, all of his followers began to shout and sing as they walked along, praising God for all the wonderful miracles they had seen.§38 "Blessings on the King who comes in the name of the Lord ! Peace in heaven, and glory in highest heaven!"*But some of the Pharisees among the crowd said, "Teacher, rebuke your followers for saying things like that!"§40 He replied, "If they kept quiet, the stones along the road would burst into cheers!"  §[Jesus Weeps over Jerusalem] 41 But as he came closer to Jerusalem and saw the city ahead, he began to weep. §42 "How I wish today that you of all people would understand the way to peace. But now it is too late, and peace is hidden from your eyes.  §43 Before long your enemies will build ramparts against your walls and encircle you and close in on you from every side.  §44 They will crush you into the ground, and your children with you. Your enemies will not leave a single stone in place, because you did not recognize it when God visited you.*"  §[Jesus Clears the Temple] 45 Then Jesus entered the Temple and began to drive out the people selling animals for sacrifices. §46 He said to them, "The Scriptures declare, "My Temple will be a house of prayer,' but you have turned it into a den of thieves."*After that, he taught daily in the Temple, but the leading priests, the teachers of religious law, and the other leaders of the people began planning how to kill him. §48 But they could think of nothing, because all the people hung on every word he said.       §§Footnotes:§ 19:10 "Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself.  § 19:13 Greek ten minas; one mina was worth about three months' wages.  § 19:38 Pss 118:26; 148:1. 39 § 19:44 Greek did not recognize the time of your visitation, a reference to the Messiah's coming.  § 19:46 Isa 56:7; Jer 7:11.  47 §
NLT/Luke 2	[The Birth of Jesus] 1 At that time the Roman emperor, Augustus, decreed that a census should be taken throughout the Roman Empire. §2 (This was the first census taken when Quirinius was governor of Syria.) §3 All returned to their own ancestral towns to register for this census. §4 And because Joseph was a descendant of King David, he had to go to Bethlehem in Judea, David's ancient home. He traveled there from the village of Nazareth in Galilee. §5 He took with him Mary, to whom he was engaged, who was now expecting a child.§6 And while they were there, the time came for her baby to be born. §7 She gave birth to her firstborn son. She wrapped him snugly in strips of cloth and laid him in a manger, because there was no lodging available for them. §[The Shepherds and Angels] 8 That night there were shepherds staying in the fields nearby, guarding their flocks of sheep. §9 Suddenly, an angel of the Lord appeared among them, and the radiance of the Lord's glory surrounded them. They were terrified, §10 but the angel reassured them. "Don't be afraid!" he said. "I bring you good news that will bring great joy to all people. §11 The Savior-yes, the Messiah, the Lord-has been born today in Bethlehem, the city of David! §12 And you will recognize him by this sign: You will find a baby wrapped snugly in strips of cloth, lying in a manger."§13 Suddenly, the angel was joined by a vast host of others-the armies of heaven-praising God and saying,§14 "Glory to God in highest heaven, and peace on earth to those with whom God is pleased."§15 When the angels had returned to heaven, the shepherds said to each other, "Let's go to Bethlehem! Let's see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about."§16 They hurried to the village and found Mary and Joseph. And there was the baby, lying in the manger. §17 After seeing him, the shepherds told everyone what had happened and what the angel had said to them about this child. §18 All who heard the shepherds' story were astonished, §19 but Mary kept all these things in her heart and thought about them often. §20 The shepherds went back to their flocks, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen. It was just as the angel had told them. §[Jesus Is Presented in the Temple] 21 Eight days later, when the baby was circumcised, he was named Jesus, the name given him by the angel even before he was conceived.§22 Then it was time for their purification offering, as required by the law of Moses after the birth of a child; so his parents took him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord. §23 The law of the Lord says, "If a woman's first child is a boy, he must be dedicated to the Lord ."* §24 So they offered the sacrifice required in the law of the Lord-"either a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons."*At that time there was a man in Jerusalem named Simeon. He was righteous and devout and was eagerly waiting for the Messiah to come and rescue Israel. The Holy Spirit was upon him §26 and had revealed to him that he would not die until he had seen the Lord's Messiah. §27 That day the Spirit led him to the Temple. So when Mary and Joseph came to present the baby Jesus to the Lord as the law required, §28 Simeon was there. He took the child in his arms and praised God, saying,§29 "Sovereign Lord, now let your servant die in peace, as you have promised.§30 I have seen your salvation,§31 which you have prepared for all people.§32 He is a light to reveal God to the nations, and he is the glory of your people Israel!"§33 Jesus' parents were amazed at what was being said about him. §34 Then Simeon blessed them, and he said to Mary, the baby's mother, "This child is destined to cause many in Israel to fall, and many others to rise. He has been sent as a sign from God, but many will oppose him. §35 As a result, the deepest thoughts of many hearts will be revealed. And a sword will pierce your very soul." §[The Prophecy of Anna] 36 Anna, a prophet, was also there in the Temple. She was the daughter of Phanuel from the tribe of Asher, and she was very old. Her husband died when they had been married only seven years. §37 Then she lived as a widow to the age of eighty-four.* She never left the Temple but stayed there day and night, worshiping God with fasting and prayer. §38 She came along just as Simeon was talking with Mary and Joseph, and she began praising God. She talked about the child to everyone who had been waiting expectantly for God to rescue Jerusalem.§39 When Jesus' parents had fulfilled all the requirements of the law of the Lord, they returned home to Nazareth in Galilee. §40 There the child grew up healthy and strong. He was filled with wisdom, and God's favor was on him. §[Jesus Speaks with the Teachers] 41 Every year Jesus' parents went to Jerusalem for the Passover festival. §42 When Jesus was twelve years old, they attended the festival as usual. §43 After the celebration was over, they started home to Nazareth, but Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. His parents didn't miss him at first, §44 because they assumed he was among the other travelers. But when he didn't show up that evening, they started looking for him among their relatives and friends.§45 When they couldn't find him, they went back to Jerusalem to search for him there. §46 Three days later they finally discovered him in the Temple, sitting among the religious teachers, listening to them and asking questions. §47 All who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers.§48 His parents didn't know what to think. "Son," his mother said to him, "why have you done this to us? Your father and I have been frantic, searching for you everywhere."§49 "But why did you need to search?"  he asked. "Didn't you know that I must be in my Father's house?"* §50 But they didn't understand what he meant.§51 Then he returned to Nazareth with them and was obedient to them. And his mother stored all these things in her heart.§52 Jesus grew in wisdom and in stature and in favor with God and all the people.       §§Footnotes:§ 2:23 Exod 13:2.  § 2:24 Lev 12:8.  §[The Prophecy of Simeon] 25 § 2:37 Or She had been a widow for eighty-four years.  § 2:49 Or "Didn't you realize that I should be involved with my Father's affairs?"  §
NLT/Luke 20	[The Authority of Jesus Challenged] 1 One day as Jesus was teaching the people and preaching the Good News in the Temple, the leading priests, the teachers of religious law, and the elders came up to him. §2 They demanded, "By what authority are you doing all these things? Who gave you the right?"§3 "Let me ask you a question first,"  he replied. §4 "Did John's authority to baptize come from heaven, or was it merely human?" 5 They talked it over among themselves. "If we say it was from heaven, he will ask why we didn't believe John. §6 But if we say it was merely human, the people will stone us because they are convinced John was a prophet." §7 So they finally replied that they didn't know.§8 And Jesus responded, "Then I won't tell you by what authority I do these things."  §[Parable of the Evil Farmers] 9 Now Jesus turned to the people again and told them this story: "A man planted a vineyard, leased it to tenant farmers, and moved to another country to live for several years.  §10 At the time of the grape harvest, he sent one of his servants to collect his share of the crop. But the farmers attacked the servant, beat him up, and sent him back empty-handed.  §11 So the owner sent another servant, but they also insulted him, beat him up, and sent him away empty-handed.  §12 A third man was sent, and they wounded him and chased him away. 13 ""What will I do?' the owner asked himself. "I know! I'll send my cherished son. Surely they will respect him.' 14 "But when the tenant farmers saw his son, they said to each other, "Here comes the heir to this estate. Let's kill him and get the estate for ourselves!'  §15 So they dragged him out of the vineyard and murdered him.  "What do you suppose the owner of the vineyard will do to them?"  Jesus asked. §16 "I'll tell you-he will come and kill those farmers and lease the vineyard to others."  "How terrible that such a thing should ever happen," his listeners protested.§17 Jesus looked at them and said, "Then what does this Scripture mean?  "The stone that the builders rejected  has now become the cornerstone.'*Everyone who stumbles over that stone will be broken to pieces, and it will crush anyone it falls on." 19 The teachers of religious law and the leading priests wanted to arrest Jesus immediately because they realized he was telling the story against them-they were the wicked farmers. But they were afraid of the people's reaction. §[Taxes for Caesar] 20 Watching for their opportunity, the leaders sent spies pretending to be honest men. They tried to get Jesus to say something that could be reported to the Roman governor so he would arrest Jesus. §21 "Teacher," they said, "we know that you speak and teach what is right and are not influenced by what others think. You teach the way of God truthfully. §22 Now tell us-is it right for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?"§23 He saw through their trickery and said, §24 "Show me a Roman coin.* Whose picture and title are stamped on it?"  "Caesar's," they replied.§25 "Well then,"  he said, "give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar, and give to God what belongs to God." 26 So they failed to trap him by what he said in front of the people. Instead, they were amazed by his answer, and they became silent. §[Discussion about Resurrection] 27 Then Jesus was approached by some Sadducees-religious leaders who say there is no resurrection from the dead. §28 They posed this question: "Teacher, Moses gave us a law that if a man dies, leaving a wife but no children, his brother should marry the widow and have a child who will carry on the brother's name.* §29 Well, suppose there were seven brothers. The oldest one married and then died without children. §30 So the second brother married the widow, but he also died. §31 Then the third brother married her. This continued with all seven of them, who died without children. §32 Finally, the woman also died. §33 So tell us, whose wife will she be in the resurrection? For all seven were married to her!"§34 Jesus replied, "Marriage is for people here on earth.  §35 But in the age to come, those worthy of being raised from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage.  §36 And they will never die again. In this respect they will be like angels. They are children of God and children of the resurrection. 37 "But now, as to whether the dead will be raised-even Moses proved this when he wrote about the burning bush. Long after Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob had died, he referred to the Lord* as "the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.'* §38 So he is the God of the living, not the dead, for they are all alive to him." 39 "Well said, Teacher!" remarked some of the teachers of religious law who were standing there. §40 And then no one dared to ask him any more questions. §[Whose Son Is the Messiah?] 41 Then Jesus presented them with a question. "Why is it,"  he asked, "that the Messiah is said to be the son of David?  §42 For David himself wrote in the book of Psalms:  "The  Lord  said to my Lord,  Sit in the place of honor at my right hand 43 until I humble your enemies,  making them a footstool under your feet.'*Since David called the Messiah "Lord,' how can the Messiah be his son?" 45 Then, with the crowds listening, he turned to his disciples and said, §46 "Beware of these teachers of religious law! For they like to parade around in flowing robes and love to receive respectful greetings as they walk in the marketplaces. And how they love the seats of honor in the synagogues and the head table at banquets.  §47 Yet they shamelessly cheat widows out of their property and then pretend to be pious by making long prayers in public. Because of this, they will be severely punished."        §§Footnotes:§ 20:17 Ps 118:22.  18 § 20:24 Greek a denarius.  § 20:28 See Deut 25:5-6.  § 20:37a Greek when he wrote about the bush.

NLT/Luke 21	[The Widow's Offering] 1 While Jesus was in the Temple, he watched the rich people dropping their gifts in the collection box. §2 Then a poor widow came by and dropped in two small coins.*"I tell you the truth,"  Jesus said, "this poor widow has given more than all the rest of them.  §4 For they have given a tiny part of their surplus, but she, poor as she is, has given everything she has."  §[Jesus Speaks about the Future] 5 Some of his disciples began talking about the majestic stonework of the Temple and the memorial decorations on the walls. But Jesus said, §6 "The time is coming when all these things will be completely demolished. Not one stone will be left on top of another!" 7 "Teacher," they asked, "when will all this happen? What sign will show us that these things are about to take place?"§8 He replied, "Don't let anyone mislead you, for many will come in my name, claiming, "I am the Messiah,'* and saying, "The time has come!' But don't believe them.  §9 And when you hear of wars and insurrections, don't panic. Yes, these things must take place first, but the end won't follow immediately."  §10 Then he added, "Nation will go to war against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.  §11 There will be great earthquakes, and there will be famines and plagues in many lands, and there will be terrifying things and great miraculous signs from heaven. 12 "But before all this occurs, there will be a time of great persecution. You will be dragged into synagogues and prisons, and you will stand trial before kings and governors because you are my followers.  §13 But this will be your opportunity to tell them about me.* §14 So don't worry in advance about how to answer the charges against you,  §15 for I will give you the right words and such wisdom that none of your opponents will be able to reply or refute you!  §16 Even those closest to you-your parents, brothers, relatives, and friends-will betray you. They will even kill some of you.  §17 And everyone will hate you because you are my followers.* §18 But not a hair of your head will perish!  §19 By standing firm, you will win your souls. 20 "And when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then you will know that the time of its destruction has arrived.  §21 Then those in Judea must flee to the hills. Those in Jerusalem must get out, and those out in the country should not return to the city.  §22 For those will be days of God's vengeance, and the prophetic words of the Scriptures will be fulfilled.  §23 How terrible it will be for pregnant women and for nursing mothers in those days. For there will be disaster in the land and great anger against this people.  §24 They will be killed by the sword or sent away as captives to all the nations of the world. And Jerusalem will be trampled down by the Gentiles until the period of the Gentiles comes to an end. 25 "And there will be strange signs in the sun, moon, and stars. And here on earth the nations will be in turmoil, perplexed by the roaring seas and strange tides.  §26 People will be terrified at what they see coming upon the earth, for the powers in the heavens will be shaken.  §27 Then everyone will see the Son of Man* coming on a cloud with power and great glory.* §28 So when all these things begin to happen, stand and look up, for your salvation is near!" 29 Then he gave them this illustration: "Notice the fig tree, or any other tree.  §30 When the leaves come out, you know without being told that summer is near.  §31 In the same way, when you see all these things taking place, you can know that the Kingdom of God is near.  §32 I tell you the truth, this generation will not pass from the scene until all these things have taken place.  §33 Heaven and earth will disappear, but my words will never disappear. 34 "Watch out! Don't let your hearts be dulled by carousing and drunkenness, and by the worries of this life. Don't let that day catch you unaware,  §35 like a trap. For that day will come upon everyone living on the earth.  §36 Keep alert at all times. And pray that you might be strong enough to escape these coming horrors and stand before the Son of Man." 37 Every day Jesus went to the Temple to teach, and each evening he returned to spend the night on the Mount of Olives. §38 The crowds gathered at the Temple early each morning to hear him.       §§Footnotes:§ 21:2 Greek two lepta [the smallest of Jewish coins]. 3 § 21:8 Greek claiming, "I am.'  § 21:13 Or This will be your testimony against them.  § 21:17 Greek on account of my name.  § 21:27a "Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself.  § 21:27b See Dan 7:13.  §
NLT/Luke 22	[Judas Agrees to Betray Jesus] 1 The Festival of Unleavened Bread, which is also called Passover, was approaching. §2 The leading priests and teachers of religious law were plotting how to kill Jesus, but they were afraid of the people's reaction.§3 Then Satan entered into Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve disciples, §4 and he went to the leading priests and captains of the Temple guard to discuss the best way to betray Jesus to them. §5 They were delighted, and they promised to give him money. §6 So he agreed and began looking for an opportunity to betray Jesus so they could arrest him when the crowds weren't around. §[The Last Supper] 7 Now the Festival of Unleavened Bread arrived, when the Passover lamb is sacrificed. §8 Jesus sent Peter and John ahead and said, "Go and prepare the Passover meal, so we can eat it together." 9 "Where do you want us to prepare it?" they asked him.§10 He replied, "As soon as you enter Jerusalem, a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you. Follow him. At the house he enters,  §11 say to the owner, "The Teacher asks: Where is the guest room where I can eat the Passover meal with my disciples?'  §12 He will take you upstairs to a large room that is already set up. That is where you should prepare our meal."  §13 They went off to the city and found everything just as Jesus had said, and they prepared the Passover meal there.§14 When the time came, Jesus and the apostles sat down together at the table.* §15 Jesus said, "I have been very eager to eat this Passover meal with you before my suffering begins.  §16 For I tell you now that I won't eat this meal again until its meaning is fulfilled in the Kingdom of God." 17 Then he took a cup of wine and gave thanks to God for it. Then he said, "Take this and share it among yourselves.  §18 For I will not drink wine again until the Kingdom of God has come." 19 He took some bread and gave thanks to God for it. Then he broke it in pieces and gave it to the disciples, saying, "This is my body, which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me." 20 After supper he took another cup of wine and said, "This cup is the new covenant between God and his people-an agreement confirmed with my blood, which is poured out as a sacrifice for you.*"But here at this table, sitting among us as a friend, is the man who will betray me.  §22 For it has been determined that the Son of Man* must die. But what sorrow awaits the one who betrays him."  §23 The disciples began to ask each other which of them would ever do such a thing.§24 Then they began to argue among themselves about who would be the greatest among them. §25 Jesus told them, "In this world the kings and great men lord it over their people, yet they are called "friends of the people.'  §26 But among you it will be different. Those who are the greatest among you should take the lowest rank, and the leader should be like a servant.  §27 Who is more important, the one who sits at the table or the one who serves? The one who sits at the table, of course. But not here! For I am among you as one who serves. 28 "You have stayed with me in my time of trial.  §29 And just as my Father has granted me a Kingdom, I now grant you the right  §30 to eat and drink at my table in my Kingdom. And you will sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.  §[Jesus Predicts Peter's Denial] 31 "Simon, Simon, Satan has asked to sift each of you like wheat.  §32 But I have pleaded in prayer for you, Simon, that your faith should not fail. So when you have repented and turned to me again, strengthen your brothers." 33 Peter said, "Lord, I am ready to go to prison with you, and even to die with you."§34 But Jesus said, "Peter, let me tell you something. Before the rooster crows tomorrow morning, you will deny three times that you even know me." 35 Then Jesus asked them, "When I sent you out to preach the Good News and you did not have money, a traveler's bag, or an extra pair of sandals, did you need anything?"  "No," they replied.§36 "But now,"  he said, "take your money and a traveler's bag. And if you don't have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one!  §37 For the time has come for this prophecy about me to be fulfilled: "He was counted among the rebels.'* Yes, everything written about me by the prophets will come true." 38 "Look, Lord," they replied, "we have two swords among us." "That's enough,"  he said. §[Jesus Prays on the Mount of Olives] 39 Then, accompanied by the disciples, Jesus left the upstairs room and went as usual to the Mount of Olives. §40 There he told them, "Pray that you will not give in to temptation." 41 He walked away, about a stone's throw, and knelt down and prayed, §42 "Father, if you are willing, please take this cup of suffering away from me. Yet I want your will to be done, not mine."  §43 Then an angel from heaven appeared and strengthened him. §44 He prayed more fervently, and he was in such agony of spirit that his sweat fell to the ground like great drops of blood.*At last he stood up again and returned to the disciples, only to find them asleep, exhausted from grief. §46 "Why are you sleeping?"  he asked them. "Get up and pray, so that you will not give in to temptation."  §[Jesus Is Betrayed and Arrested] 47 But even as Jesus said this, a crowd approached, led by Judas, one of the twelve disciples. Judas walked over to Jesus to greet him with a kiss. §48 But Jesus said, "Judas, would you betray the Son of Man with a kiss?" 49 When the other disciples saw what was about to happen, they exclaimed, "Lord, should we fight? We brought the swords!" §50 And one of them struck at the high priest's slave, slashing off his right ear.§51 But Jesus said, "No more of this."  And he touched the man's ear and healed him.§52 Then Jesus spoke to the leading priests, the captains of the Temple guard, and the elders who had come for him. "Am I some dangerous revolutionary,"  he asked, "that you come with swords and clubs to arrest me?  §53 Why didn't you arrest me in the Temple? I was there every day. But this is your moment, the time when the power of darkness reigns."  §[Peter Denies Jesus] 54 So they arrested him and led him to the high priest's home. And Peter followed at a distance. §55 The guards lit a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat around it, and Peter joined them there. §56 A servant girl noticed him in the firelight and began staring at him. Finally she said, "This man was one of Jesus' followers!"§57 But Peter denied it. "Woman," he said, "I don't even know him!"§58 After a while someone else looked at him and said, "You must be one of them!" "No, man, I'm not!" Peter retorted.§59 About an hour later someone else insisted, "This must be one of them, because he is a Galilean, too."§60 But Peter said, "Man, I don't know what you are talking about." And immediately, while he was still speaking, the rooster crowed.§61 At that moment the Lord turned and looked at Peter. Suddenly, the Lord's words flashed through Peter's mind: "Before the rooster crows tomorrow morning, you will deny three times that you even know me."  §62 And Peter left the courtyard, weeping bitterly.§63 The guards in charge of Jesus began mocking and beating him. §64 They blindfolded him and said, "Prophesy to us! Who hit you that time?" §65 And they hurled all sorts of terrible insults at him. §[Jesus before the Council] 66 At daybreak all the elders of the people assembled, including the leading priests and the teachers of religious law. Jesus was led before this high council,* §67 and they said, "Tell us, are you the Messiah?" But he replied, "If I tell you, you won't believe me.  §68 And if I ask you a question, you won't answer.  §69 But from now on the Son of Man will be seated in the place of power at God's right hand.*" §70 They all shouted, "So, are you claiming to be the Son of God?" And he replied, "You say that I am." §71 "Why do we need other witnesses?" they said. "We ourselves heard him say it."       §§Footnotes:§ 22:14 Or reclined together.  § 22:19-20 Some manuscripts do not include 22:19b-20, which is given for you . . . which is poured out as a sacrifice for you.  21 § 22:22 "Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself.  § 22:37 Isa 53:12.  § 22:43-44 Verses 43 and 44 are not included in the most ancient manuscripts. 45 § 22:66 Greek before their Sanhedrin.  § 22:69 See Ps 110:1.  §
NLT/Luke 23	[Jesus' Trial before Pilate] 1 Then the entire council took Jesus to Pilate, the Roman governor. §2 They began to state their case: "This man has been leading our people astray by telling them not to pay their taxes to the Roman government and by claiming he is the Messiah, a king."§3 So Pilate asked him, "Are you the king of the Jews?" Jesus replied, "You have said it." 4 Pilate turned to the leading priests and to the crowd and said, "I find nothing wrong with this man!"§5 Then they became insistent. "But he is causing riots by his teaching wherever he goes-all over Judea, from Galilee to Jerusalem!"§6 "Oh, is he a Galilean?" Pilate asked. §7 When they said that he was, Pilate sent him to Herod Antipas, because Galilee was under Herod's jurisdiction, and Herod happened to be in Jerusalem at the time.§8 Herod was delighted at the opportunity to see Jesus, because he had heard about him and had been hoping for a long time to see him perform a miracle. §9 He asked Jesus question after question, but Jesus refused to answer. §10 Meanwhile, the leading priests and the teachers of religious law stood there shouting their accusations. §11 Then Herod and his soldiers began mocking and ridiculing Jesus. Finally, they put a royal robe on him and sent him back to Pilate. §12 (Herod and Pilate, who had been enemies before, became friends that day.)§13 Then Pilate called together the leading priests and other religious leaders, along with the people, §14 and he announced his verdict. "You brought this man to me, accusing him of leading a revolt. I have examined him thoroughly on this point in your presence and find him innocent. §15 Herod came to the same conclusion and sent him back to us. Nothing this man has done calls for the death penalty. §16 So I will have him flogged, and then I will release him."*Then a mighty roar rose from the crowd, and with one voice they shouted, "Kill him, and release Barabbas to us!" §19 (Barabbas was in prison for taking part in an insurrection in Jerusalem against the government, and for murder.) §20 Pilate argued with them, because he wanted to release Jesus. §21 But they kept shouting, "Crucify him! Crucify him!"§22 For the third time he demanded, "Why? What crime has he committed? I have found no reason to sentence him to death. So I will have him flogged, and then I will release him."§23 But the mob shouted louder and louder, demanding that Jesus be crucified, and their voices prevailed. §24 So Pilate sentenced Jesus to die as they demanded. §25 As they had requested, he released Barabbas, the man in prison for insurrection and murder. But he turned Jesus over to them to do as they wished. §[The Crucifixion] 26 As they led Jesus away, a man named Simon, who was from Cyrene,* happened to be coming in from the countryside. The soldiers seized him and put the cross on him and made him carry it behind Jesus. §27 A large crowd trailed behind, including many grief-stricken women. §28 But Jesus turned and said to them, "Daughters of Jerusalem, don't weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.  §29 For the days are coming when they will say, "Fortunate indeed are the women who are childless, the wombs that have not borne a child and the breasts that have never nursed.'  §30 People will beg the mountains, "Fall on us,' and plead with the hills, "Bury us.'* §31 For if these things are done when the tree is green, what will happen when it is dry?*" 32 Two others, both criminals, were led out to be executed with him. §33 When they came to a place called The Skull,* they nailed him to the cross. And the criminals were also crucified-one on his right and one on his left.§34 Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, for they don't know what they are doing."* And the soldiers gambled for his clothes by throwing dice.*The crowd watched and the leaders scoffed. "He saved others," they said, "let him save himself if he is really God's Messiah, the Chosen One." §36 The soldiers mocked him, too, by offering him a drink of sour wine. §37 They called out to him, "If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!" §38 A sign was fastened above him with these words: "This is the King of the Jews."§39 One of the criminals hanging beside him scoffed, "So you're the Messiah, are you? Prove it by saving yourself-and us, too, while you're at it!"§40 But the other criminal protested, "Don't you fear God even when you have been sentenced to die? §41 We deserve to die for our crimes, but this man hasn't done anything wrong." §42 Then he said, "Jesus, remember me when you come into your Kingdom."§43 And Jesus replied, "I assure you, today you will be with me in paradise."  §[The Death of Jesus] 44 By this time it was about noon, and darkness fell across the whole land until three o'clock. §45 The light from the sun was gone. And suddenly, the curtain in the sanctuary of the Temple was torn down the middle. §46 Then Jesus shouted, "Father, I entrust my spirit into your hands!"* And with those words he breathed his last.§47 When the Roman officer* overseeing the execution saw what had happened, he worshiped God and said, "Surely this man was innocent.*" §48 And when all the crowd that came to see the crucifixion saw what had happened, they went home in deep sorrow.* §49 But Jesus' friends, including the women who had followed him from Galilee, stood at a distance watching. §[The Burial of Jesus] 50 Now there was a good and righteous man named Joseph. He was a member of the Jewish high council, §51 but he had not agreed with the decision and actions of the other religious leaders. He was from the town of Arimathea in Judea, and he was waiting for the Kingdom of God to come. §52 He went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. §53 Then he took the body down from the cross and wrapped it in a long sheet of linen cloth and laid it in a new tomb that had been carved out of rock. §54 This was done late on Friday afternoon, the day of preparation,* as the Sabbath was about to begin.§55 As his body was taken away, the women from Galilee followed and saw the tomb where his body was placed. §56 Then they went home and prepared spices and ointments to anoint his body. But by the time they were finished the Sabbath had begun, so they rested as required by the law.       §§Footnotes:§ 23:16 Some manuscripts add verse 17, Now it was necessary for him to release one prisoner to them during the Passover celebration.

NLT/Luke 24	[The Resurrection] 1 But very early on Sunday morning* the women went to the tomb, taking the spices they had prepared. §2 They found that the stone had been rolled away from the entrance. §3 So they went in, but they didn't find the body of the Lord Jesus. §4 As they stood there puzzled, two men suddenly appeared to them, clothed in dazzling robes.§5 The women were terrified and bowed with their faces to the ground. Then the men asked, "Why are you looking among the dead for someone who is alive? §6 He isn't here! He is risen from the dead! Remember what he told you back in Galilee, §7 that the Son of Man* must be betrayed into the hands of sinful men and be crucified, and that he would rise again on the third day."§8 Then they remembered that he had said this. §9 So they rushed back from the tomb to tell his eleven disciples-and everyone else-what had happened. §10 It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and several other women who told the apostles what had happened. §11 But the story sounded like nonsense to the men, so they didn't believe it. §12 However, Peter jumped up and ran to the tomb to look. Stooping, he peered in and saw the empty linen wrappings; then he went home again, wondering what had happened. §[The Walk to Emmaus] 13 That same day two of Jesus' followers were walking to the village of Emmaus, seven miles* from Jerusalem. §14 As they walked along they were talking about everything that had happened. §15 As they talked and discussed these things, Jesus himself suddenly came and began walking with them. §16 But God kept them from recognizing him.§17 He asked them, "What are you discussing so intently as you walk along?"  They stopped short, sadness written across their faces. §18 Then one of them, Cleopas, replied, "You must be the only person in Jerusalem who hasn't heard about all the things that have happened there the last few days."§19 "What things?"  Jesus asked. "The things that happened to Jesus, the man from Nazareth," they said. "He was a prophet who did powerful miracles, and he was a mighty teacher in the eyes of God and all the people. §20 But our leading priests and other religious leaders handed him over to be condemned to death, and they crucified him. §21 We had hoped he was the Messiah who had come to rescue Israel. This all happened three days ago.§22 "Then some women from our group of his followers were at his tomb early this morning, and they came back with an amazing report. §23 They said his body was missing, and they had seen angels who told them Jesus is alive! §24 Some of our men ran out to see, and sure enough, his body was gone, just as the women had said."§25 Then Jesus said to them, "You foolish people! You find it so hard to believe all that the prophets wrote in the Scriptures.  §26 Wasn't it clearly predicted that the Messiah would have to suffer all these things before entering his glory?"  §27 Then Jesus took them through the writings of Moses and all the prophets, explaining from all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.§28 By this time they were nearing Emmaus and the end of their journey. Jesus acted as if he were going on, §29 but they begged him, "Stay the night with us, since it is getting late." So he went home with them. §30 As they sat down to eat,* he took the bread and blessed it. Then he broke it and gave it to them. §31 Suddenly, their eyes were opened, and they recognized him. And at that moment he disappeared!§32 They said to each other, "Didn't our hearts burn within us as he talked with us on the road and explained the Scriptures to us?" §33 And within the hour they were on their way back to Jerusalem. There they found the eleven disciples and the others who had gathered with them, §34 who said, "The Lord has really risen! He appeared to Peter.*" §[Jesus Appears to the Disciples] 35 Then the two from Emmaus told their story of how Jesus had appeared to them as they were walking along the road, and how they had recognized him as he was breaking the bread. §36 And just as they were telling about it, Jesus himself was suddenly standing there among them. "Peace be with you,"  he said. §37 But the whole group was startled and frightened, thinking they were seeing a ghost!§38 "Why are you frightened?"  he asked. "Why are your hearts filled with doubt?  §39 Look at my hands. Look at my feet. You can see that it's really me. Touch me and make sure that I am not a ghost, because ghosts don't have bodies, as you see that I do."  §40 As he spoke, he showed them his hands and his feet.§41 Still they stood there in disbelief, filled with joy and wonder. Then he asked them, "Do you have anything here to eat?"  §42 They gave him a piece of broiled fish, §43 and he ate it as they watched.§44 Then he said, "When I was with you before, I told you that everything written about me in the law of Moses and the prophets and in the Psalms must be fulfilled."  §45 Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures. §46 And he said, "Yes, it was written long ago that the Messiah would suffer and die and rise from the dead on the third day.  §47 It was also written that this message would be proclaimed in the authority of his name to all the nations,* beginning in Jerusalem: "There is forgiveness of sins for all who repent.'  §48 You are witnesses of all these things. 49 "And now I will send the Holy Spirit, just as my Father promised. But stay here in the city until the Holy Spirit comes and fills you with power from heaven."  §[The Ascension] 50 Then Jesus led them to Bethany, and lifting his hands to heaven, he blessed them. §51 While he was blessing them, he left them and was taken up to heaven. §52 So they worshiped him and then returned to Jerusalem filled with great joy. §53 And they spent all of their time in the Temple, praising God.       §§Footnotes:§ 24:1 Greek But on the first day of the week, very early in the morning.  § 24:7 "Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself.  § 24:13 Greek 60 stadia [11.1 kilometers].  § 24:30 Or As they reclined.  § 24:34 Greek Simon.  § 24:47 Or all peoples.  §
NLT/Luke 3	[John the Baptist Prepares the Way] 1 It was now the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius, the Roman emperor. Pontius Pilate was governor over Judea; Herod Antipas was ruler* over Galilee; his brother Philip was ruler* over Iturea and Traconitis; Lysanias was ruler over Abilene. §2 Annas and Caiaphas were the high priests. At this time a message from God came to John son of Zechariah, who was living in the wilderness. §3 Then John went from place to place on both sides of the Jordan River, preaching that people should be baptized to show that they had repented of their sins and turned to God to be forgiven. §4 Isaiah had spoken of John when he said, "He is a voice shouting in the wilderness, "Prepare the way for the Lord 's coming! Clear the road for him!§5 The valleys will be filled, and the mountains and hills made level. The curves will be straightened, and the rough places made smooth.§6 And then all people will see the salvation sent from God.'"*When the crowds came to John for baptism, he said, "You brood of snakes! Who warned you to flee the coming wrath? §8 Prove by the way you live that you have repented of your sins and turned to God. Don't just say to each other, "We're safe, for we are descendants of Abraham.' That means nothing, for I tell you, God can create children of Abraham from these very stones. §9 Even now the ax of God's judgment is poised, ready to sever the roots of the trees. Yes, every tree that does not produce good fruit will be chopped down and thrown into the fire."§10 The crowds asked, "What should we do?"§11 John replied, "If you have two shirts, give one to the poor. If you have food, share it with those who are hungry."§12 Even corrupt tax collectors came to be baptized and asked, "Teacher, what should we do?"§13 He replied, "Collect no more taxes than the government requires."§14 "What should we do?" asked some soldiers. John replied, "Don't extort money or make false accusations. And be content with your pay."§15 Everyone was expecting the Messiah to come soon, and they were eager to know whether John might be the Messiah. §16 John answered their questions by saying, "I baptize you with* water; but someone is coming soon who is greater than I am-so much greater that I'm not even worthy to be his slave and untie the straps of his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.* §17 He is ready to separate the chaff from the wheat with his winnowing fork. Then he will clean up the threshing area, gathering the wheat into his barn but burning the chaff with never-ending fire." §18 John used many such warnings as he announced the Good News to the people.§19 John also publicly criticized Herod Antipas, the ruler of Galilee,* for marrying Herodias, his brother's wife, and for many other wrongs he had done. §20 So Herod put John in prison, adding this sin to his many others. §[The Baptism of Jesus] 21 One day when the crowds were being baptized, Jesus himself was baptized. As he was praying, the heavens opened, §22 and the Holy Spirit, in bodily form, descended on him like a dove. And a voice from heaven said, "You are my dearly loved Son, and you bring me great joy.*" §[The Ancestors of Jesus] 23 Jesus was about thirty years old when he began his public ministry.

NLT/Luke 4	[The Temptation of Jesus] 1 Then Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan River. He was led by the Spirit in the wilderness,* §2 where he was tempted by the devil for forty days. Jesus ate nothing all that time and became very hungry.§3 Then the devil said to him, "If you are the Son of God, tell this stone to become a loaf of bread."§4 But Jesus told him, "No! The Scriptures say, "People do not live by bread alone.'*" 5 Then the devil took him up and revealed to him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time. §6 "I will give you the glory of these kingdoms and authority over them," the devil said, "because they are mine to give to anyone I please. §7 I will give it all to you if you will worship me."§8 Jesus replied, "The Scriptures say,  "You must worship the  Lord  your God  and serve only him.'*" 9 Then the devil took him to Jerusalem, to the highest point of the Temple, and said, "If you are the Son of God, jump off! §10 For the Scriptures say, "He will order his angels to protect and guard you.§11 And they will hold you up with their hands so you won't even hurt your foot on a stone.'*"§12 Jesus responded, "The Scriptures also say, "You must not test the  Lord  your God.'*" 13 When the devil had finished tempting Jesus, he left him until the next opportunity came. §[Jesus Rejected at Nazareth] 14 Then Jesus returned to Galilee, filled with the Holy Spirit's power. Reports about him spread quickly through the whole region. §15 He taught regularly in their synagogues and was praised by everyone.§16 When he came to the village of Nazareth, his boyhood home, he went as usual to the synagogue on the Sabbath and stood up to read the Scriptures. §17 The scroll of Isaiah the prophet was handed to him. He unrolled the scroll and found the place where this was written:§18 "The Spirit of the  Lord  is upon me,  for he has anointed me to bring Good News to the poor.  He has sent me to proclaim that captives will be released,  that the blind will see,  that the oppressed will be set free, 19 and that the time of the  Lord  's favor has come.*" 20 He rolled up the scroll, handed it back to the attendant, and sat down. All eyes in the synagogue looked at him intently. §21 Then he began to speak to them. "The Scripture you've just heard has been fulfilled this very day!" 22 Everyone spoke well of him and was amazed by the gracious words that came from his lips. "How can this be?" they asked. "Isn't this Joseph's son?"§23 Then he said, "You will undoubtedly quote me this proverb: "Physician, heal yourself'-meaning, "Do miracles here in your hometown like those you did in Capernaum.'  §24 But I tell you the truth, no prophet is accepted in his own hometown. 25 "Certainly there were many needy widows in Israel in Elijah's time, when the heavens were closed for three and a half years, and a severe famine devastated the land.  §26 Yet Elijah was not sent to any of them. He was sent instead to a foreigner-a widow of Zarephath in the land of Sidon.  §27 And many in Israel had leprosy in the time of the prophet Elisha, but the only one healed was Naaman, a Syrian." 28 When they heard this, the people in the synagogue were furious. §29 Jumping up, they mobbed him and forced him to the edge of the hill on which the town was built. They intended to push him over the cliff, §30 but he passed right through the crowd and went on his way. §[Jesus Casts Out a Demon] 31 Then Jesus went to Capernaum, a town in Galilee, and taught there in the synagogue every Sabbath day. §32 There, too, the people were amazed at his teaching, for he spoke with authority.§33 Once when he was in the synagogue, a man possessed by a demon-an evil* spirit-cried out, shouting, §34 "Go away! Why are you interfering with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are-the Holy One of God!"§35 But Jesus reprimanded him. "Be quiet! Come out of the man,"  he ordered. At that, the demon threw the man to the floor as the crowd watched; then it came out of him without hurting him further.§36 Amazed, the people exclaimed, "What authority and power this man's words possess! Even evil spirits obey him, and they flee at his command!" §37 The news about Jesus spread through every village in the entire region. §[Jesus Heals Many People] 38 After leaving the synagogue that day, Jesus went to Simon's home, where he found Simon's mother-in-law very sick with a high fever. "Please heal her," everyone begged. §39 Standing at her bedside, he rebuked the fever, and it left her. And she got up at once and prepared a meal for them.§40 As the sun went down that evening, people throughout the village brought sick family members to Jesus. No matter what their diseases were, the touch of his hand healed every one. §41 Many were possessed by demons; and the demons came out at his command, shouting, "You are the Son of God!" But because they knew he was the Messiah, he rebuked them and refused to let them speak. §[Jesus Continues to Preach] 42 Early the next morning Jesus went out to an isolated place. The crowds searched everywhere for him, and when they finally found him, they begged him not to leave them. §43 But he replied, "I must preach the Good News of the Kingdom of God in other towns, too, because that is why I was sent."  §44 So he continued to travel around, preaching in synagogues throughout Judea.*§§Footnotes:§ 4:1 Some manuscripts read into the wilderness.  § 4:4 Deut 8:3.  § 4:8 Deut 6:13.  § 4:10-11 Ps 91:11-12.  § 4:12 Deut 6:16.  § 4:18-19 Or and to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord .

NLT/Luke 5	[The First Disciples] 1 One day as Jesus was preaching on the shore of the Sea of Galilee,* great crowds pressed in on him to listen to the word of God. §2 He noticed two empty boats at the water's edge, for the fishermen had left them and were washing their nets. §3 Stepping into one of the boats, Jesus asked Simon,* its owner, to push it out into the water. So he sat in the boat and taught the crowds from there.§4 When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, "Now go out where it is deeper, and let down your nets to catch some fish." 5 "Master," Simon replied, "we worked hard all last night and didn't catch a thing. But if you say so, I'll let the nets down again." §6 And this time their nets were so full of fish they began to tear! §7 A shout for help brought their partners in the other boat, and soon both boats were filled with fish and on the verge of sinking.§8 When Simon Peter realized what had happened, he fell to his knees before Jesus and said, "Oh, Lord, please leave me-I'm such a sinful man." §9 For he was awestruck by the number of fish they had caught, as were the others with him. §10 His partners, James and John, the sons of Zebedee, were also amazed. Jesus replied to Simon, "Don't be afraid! From now on you'll be fishing for people!"  §11 And as soon as they landed, they left everything and followed Jesus. §[Jesus Heals a Man with Leprosy] 12 In one of the villages, Jesus met a man with an advanced case of leprosy. When the man saw Jesus, he bowed with his face to the ground, begging to be healed. "Lord," he said, "if you are willing, you can heal me and make me clean."§13 Jesus reached out and touched him. "I am willing,"  he said. "Be healed!"  And instantly the leprosy disappeared. §14 Then Jesus instructed him not to tell anyone what had happened. He said, "Go to the priest and let him examine you. Take along the offering required in the law of Moses for those who have been healed of leprosy.* This will be a public testimony that you have been cleansed." 15 But despite Jesus' instructions, the report of his power spread even faster, and vast crowds came to hear him preach and to be healed of their diseases. §16 But Jesus often withdrew to the wilderness for prayer. §[Jesus Heals a Paralyzed Man] 17 One day while Jesus was teaching, some Pharisees and teachers of religious law were sitting nearby. (It seemed that these men showed up from every village in all Galilee and Judea, as well as from Jerusalem.) And the Lord's healing power was strongly with Jesus.§18 Some men came carrying a paralyzed man on a sleeping mat. They tried to take him inside to Jesus, §19 but they couldn't reach him because of the crowd. So they went up to the roof and took off some tiles. Then they lowered the sick man on his mat down into the crowd, right in front of Jesus. §20 Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the man, "Young man, your sins are forgiven." 21 But the Pharisees and teachers of religious law said to themselves, "Who does he think he is? That's blasphemy! Only God can forgive sins!"§22 Jesus knew what they were thinking, so he asked them, "Why do you question this in your hearts?  §23 Is it easier to say "Your sins are forgiven,' or "Stand up and walk'?  §24 So I will prove to you that the Son of Man* has the authority on earth to forgive sins."  Then Jesus turned to the paralyzed man and said, "Stand up, pick up your mat, and go home!" 25 And immediately, as everyone watched, the man jumped up, picked up his mat, and went home praising God. §26 Everyone was gripped with great wonder and awe, and they praised God, exclaiming, "We have seen amazing things today!" §[Jesus Calls Levi (Matthew)] 27 Later, as Jesus left the town, he saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at his tax collector's booth. "Follow me and be my disciple,"  Jesus said to him. §28 So Levi got up, left everything, and followed him.§29 Later, Levi held a banquet in his home with Jesus as the guest of honor. Many of Levi's fellow tax collectors and other guests also ate with them. §30 But the Pharisees and their teachers of religious law complained bitterly to Jesus' disciples, "Why do you eat and drink with such scum?*"§31 Jesus answered them, "Healthy people don't need a doctor-sick people do.  §32 I have come to call not those who think they are righteous, but those who know they are sinners and need to repent."  §[A Discussion about Fasting] 33 One day some people said to Jesus, "John the Baptist's disciples fast and pray regularly, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees. Why are your disciples always eating and drinking?"§34 Jesus responded, "Do wedding guests fast while celebrating with the groom? Of course not.  §35 But someday the groom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast." 36 Then Jesus gave them this illustration: "No one tears a piece of cloth from a new garment and uses it to patch an old garment. For then the new garment would be ruined, and the new patch wouldn't even match the old garment. 37 "And no one puts new wine into old wineskins. For the new wine would burst the wineskins, spilling the wine and ruining the skins.  §38 New wine must be stored in new wineskins.  §39 But no one who drinks the old wine seems to want the new wine. "The old is just fine,' they say."        §§Footnotes:§ 5:1 Greek Lake Gennesaret, another name for the Sea of Galilee.  § 5:3 Simon is called "Peter" in 6:14 and thereafter.  § 5:14 See Lev 14:2-32.  § 5:24 "Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself.  § 5:30 Greek with tax collectors and sinners?  §
NLT/Luke 6	[A Discussion about the Sabbath] 1 One Sabbath day as Jesus was walking through some grainfields, his disciples broke off heads of grain, rubbed off the husks in their hands, and ate the grain. §2 But some Pharisees said, "Why are you breaking the law by harvesting grain on the Sabbath?"§3 Jesus replied, "Haven't you read in the Scriptures what David did when he and his companions were hungry?  §4 He went into the house of God and broke the law by eating the sacred loaves of bread that only the priests can eat. He also gave some to his companions."  §5 And Jesus added, "The Son of Man* is Lord, even over the Sabbath."  §[Jesus Heals on the Sabbath] 6 On another Sabbath day, a man with a deformed right hand was in the synagogue while Jesus was teaching. §7 The teachers of religious law and the Pharisees watched Jesus closely. If he healed the man's hand, they planned to accuse him of working on the Sabbath.§8 But Jesus knew their thoughts. He said to the man with the deformed hand, "Come and stand in front of everyone."  So the man came forward. §9 Then Jesus said to his critics, "I have a question for you. Does the law permit good deeds on the Sabbath, or is it a day for doing evil? Is this a day to save life or to destroy it?" 10 He looked around at them one by one and then said to the man, "Hold out your hand."  So the man held out his hand, and it was restored! §11 At this, the enemies of Jesus were wild with rage and began to discuss what to do with him. §[Jesus Chooses the Twelve Apostles] 12 One day soon afterward Jesus went up on a mountain to pray, and he prayed to God all night. §13 At daybreak he called together all of his disciples and chose twelve of them to be apostles. Here are their names:§14 Simon (whom he named Peter), Andrew (Peter's brother), James, John, Philip, Bartholomew,§15 Matthew, Thomas, James (son of Alphaeus), Simon (who was called the zealot),§16 Judas (son of James), Judas Iscariot (who later betrayed him). §[Crowds Follow Jesus] 17 When they came down from the mountain, the disciples stood with Jesus on a large, level area, surrounded by many of his followers and by the crowds. There were people from all over Judea and from Jerusalem and from as far north as the seacoasts of Tyre and Sidon. §18 They had come to hear him and to be healed of their diseases; and those troubled by evil* spirits were healed. §19 Everyone tried to touch him, because healing power went out from him, and he healed everyone. §[The Beatitudes] 20 Then Jesus turned to his disciples and said, "God blesses you who are poor,  for the Kingdom of God is yours. 21 God blesses you who are hungry now,  for you will be satisfied.  God blesses you who weep now,  for in due time you will laugh. 22 What blessings await you when people hate you and exclude you and mock you and curse you as evil because you follow the Son of Man.  §23 When that happens, be happy! Yes, leap for joy! For a great reward awaits you in heaven. And remember, their ancestors treated the ancient prophets that same way.  §[Sorrows Foretold] 24 "What sorrow awaits you who are rich,  for you have your only happiness now. 25 What sorrow awaits you who are fat and prosperous now,  for a time of awful hunger awaits you.  What sorrow awaits you who laugh now,  for your laughing will turn to mourning and sorrow. 26 What sorrow awaits you who are praised by the crowds,  for their ancestors also praised false prophets.  §[Love for Enemies] 27 "But to you who are willing to listen, I say, love your enemies! Do good to those who hate you.  §28 Bless those who curse you. Pray for those who hurt you.  §29 If someone slaps you on one cheek, offer the other cheek also. If someone demands your coat, offer your shirt also.  §30 Give to anyone who asks; and when things are taken away from you, don't try to get them back.  §31 Do to others as you would like them to do to you. 32 "If you love only those who love you, why should you get credit for that? Even sinners love those who love them!  §33 And if you do good only to those who do good to you, why should you get credit? Even sinners do that much!  §34 And if you lend money only to those who can repay you, why should you get credit? Even sinners will lend to other sinners for a full return. 35 "Love your enemies! Do good to them. Lend to them without expecting to be repaid. Then your reward from heaven will be very great, and you will truly be acting as children of the Most High, for he is kind to those who are unthankful and wicked.  §36 You must be compassionate, just as your Father is compassionate.  §[Do Not Judge Others] 37 "Do not judge others, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn others, or it will all come back against you. Forgive others, and you will be forgiven.  §38 Give, and you will receive. Your gift will return to you in full-pressed down, shaken together to make room for more, running over, and poured into your lap. The amount you give will determine the amount you get back.*" 39 Then Jesus gave the following illustration: "Can one blind person lead another? Won't they both fall into a ditch?  §40 Students* are not greater than their teacher. But the student who is fully trained will become like the teacher. 41 "And why worry about a speck in your friend's eye* when you have a log in your own?  §42 How can you think of saying, "Friend,* let me help you get rid of that speck in your eye,' when you can't see past the log in your own eye? Hypocrite! First get rid of the log in your own eye; then you will see well enough to deal with the speck in your friend's eye.  §[The Tree and Its Fruit] 43 "A good tree can't produce bad fruit, and a bad tree can't produce good fruit.  §44 A tree is identified by its fruit. Figs are never gathered from thornbushes, and grapes are not picked from bramble bushes.  §45 A good person produces good things from the treasury of a good heart, and an evil person produces evil things from the treasury of an evil heart. What you say flows from what is in your heart.  §[Building on a Solid Foundation] 46 "So why do you keep calling me "Lord, Lord!' when you don't do what I say?  §47 I will show you what it's like when someone comes to me, listens to my teaching, and then follows it.  §48 It is like a person building a house who digs deep and lays the foundation on solid rock. When the floodwaters rise and break against that house, it stands firm because it is well built.  §49 But anyone who hears and doesn't obey is like a person who builds a house right on the ground, without a foundation. When the floods sweep down against that house, it will collapse into a heap of ruins."        §§Footnotes:§ 6:5 "Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself.  § 6:18 Greek unclean.  § 6:38 Or The measure you give will be the measure you get back.  § 6:40 Or Disciples.  § 6:41 Greek your brother's eye; also in 6:42.  § 6:42 Greek Brother.  §
NLT/Luke 7	[The Faith of a Roman Officer] 1 When Jesus had finished saying all this to the people, he returned to Capernaum. §2 At that time the highly valued slave of a Roman officer* was sick and near death. §3 When the officer heard about Jesus, he sent some respected Jewish elders to ask him to come and heal his slave. §4 So they earnestly begged Jesus to help the man. "If anyone deserves your help, he does," they said, §5 "for he loves the Jewish people and even built a synagogue for us."§6 So Jesus went with them. But just before they arrived at the house, the officer sent some friends to say, "Lord, don't trouble yourself by coming to my home, for I am not worthy of such an honor. §7 I am not even worthy to come and meet you. Just say the word from where you are, and my servant will be healed. §8 I know this because I am under the authority of my superior officers, and I have authority over my soldiers. I only need to say, "Go,' and they go, or "Come,' and they come. And if I say to my slaves, "Do this,' they do it."§9 When Jesus heard this, he was amazed. Turning to the crowd that was following him, he said, "I tell you, I haven't seen faith like this in all Israel!"  §10 And when the officer's friends returned to his house, they found the slave completely healed. §[Jesus Raises a Widow's Son] 11 Soon afterward Jesus went with his disciples to the village of Nain, and a large crowd followed him. §12 A funeral procession was coming out as he approached the village gate. The young man who had died was a widow's only son, and a large crowd from the village was with her. §13 When the Lord saw her, his heart overflowed with compassion. "Don't cry!"  he said. §14 Then he walked over to the coffin and touched it, and the bearers stopped. "Young man,"  he said, "I tell you, get up."  §15 Then the dead boy sat up and began to talk! And Jesus gave him back to his mother.§16 Great fear swept the crowd, and they praised God, saying, "A mighty prophet has risen among us," and "God has visited his people today." §17 And the news about Jesus spread throughout Judea and the surrounding countryside. §[Jesus and John the Baptist] 18 The disciples of John the Baptist told John about everything Jesus was doing. So John called for two of his disciples, §19 and he sent them to the Lord to ask him, "Are you the Messiah we've been expecting,* or should we keep looking for someone else?"§20 John's two disciples found Jesus and said to him, "John the Baptist sent us to ask, "Are you the Messiah we've been expecting, or should we keep looking for someone else?'"§21 At that very time, Jesus cured many people of their diseases, illnesses, and evil spirits, and he restored sight to many who were blind. §22 Then he told John's disciples, "Go back to John and tell him what you have seen and heard-the blind see, the lame walk, those with leprosy are cured, the deaf hear, the dead are raised to life, and the Good News is being preached to the poor."  §23 And he added, "God blesses those who do not fall away because of me.*" 24 After John's disciples left, Jesus began talking about him to the crowds. "What kind of man did you go into the wilderness to see? Was he a weak reed, swayed by every breath of wind?  §25 Or were you expecting to see a man dressed in expensive clothes? No, people who wear beautiful clothes and live in luxury are found in palaces.  §26 Were you looking for a prophet? Yes, and he is more than a prophet.  §27 John is the man to whom the Scriptures refer when they say,  "Look, I am sending my messenger ahead of you,  and he will prepare your way before you.'*I tell you, of all who have ever lived, none is greater than John. Yet even the least person in the Kingdom of God is greater than he is!" 29 When they heard this, all the people-even the tax collectors-agreed that God's way was right,* for they had been baptized by John. §30 But the Pharisees and experts in religious law rejected God's plan for them, for they had refused John's baptism.§31 "To what can I compare the people of this generation?"  Jesus asked. "How can I describe them?  §32 They are like children playing a game in the public square. They complain to their friends,  "We played wedding songs,  and you didn't dance,  so we played funeral songs,  and you didn't weep.' 33 For John the Baptist didn't spend his time eating bread or drinking wine, and you say, "He's possessed by a demon.'  §34 The Son of Man,* on the other hand, feasts and drinks, and you say, "He's a glutton and a drunkard, and a friend of tax collectors and other sinners!'  §35 But wisdom is shown to be right by the lives of those who follow it.*"  §[Jesus Anointed by a Sinful Woman] 36 One of the Pharisees asked Jesus to have dinner with him, so Jesus went to his home and sat down to eat.* §37 When a certain immoral woman from that city heard he was eating there, she brought a beautiful alabaster jar filled with expensive perfume. §38 Then she knelt behind him at his feet, weeping. Her tears fell on his feet, and she wiped them off with her hair. Then she kept kissing his feet and putting perfume on them.§39 When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, "If this man were a prophet, he would know what kind of woman is touching him. She's a sinner!"§40 Then Jesus answered his thoughts. "Simon,"  he said to the Pharisee, "I have something to say to you."  "Go ahead, Teacher," Simon replied.§41 Then Jesus told him this story: "A man loaned money to two people-500 pieces of silver* to one and 50 pieces to the other.  §42 But neither of them could repay him, so he kindly forgave them both, canceling their debts. Who do you suppose loved him more after that?" 43 Simon answered, "I suppose the one for whom he canceled the larger debt." "That's right,"  Jesus said. §44 Then he turned to the woman and said to Simon, "Look at this woman kneeling here. When I entered your home, you didn't offer me water to wash the dust from my feet, but she has washed them with her tears and wiped them with her hair.  §45 You didn't greet me with a kiss, but from the time I first came in, she has not stopped kissing my feet.  §46 You neglected the courtesy of olive oil to anoint my head, but she has anointed my feet with rare perfume. 47 "I tell you, her sins-and they are many-have been forgiven, so she has shown me much love. But a person who is forgiven little shows only little love."  §48 Then Jesus said to the woman, "Your sins are forgiven." 49 The men at the table said among themselves, "Who is this man, that he goes around forgiving sins?"§50 And Jesus said to the woman, "Your faith has saved you; go in peace."        §§Footnotes:§ 7:2 Greek a centurion; similarly in 7:6.  § 7:19 Greek Are you the one who is coming?

NLT/Luke 8	[Women Who Followed Jesus] 1 Soon afterward Jesus began a tour of the nearby towns and villages, preaching and announcing the Good News about the Kingdom of God. He took his twelve disciples with him, §2 along with some women who had been cured of evil spirits and diseases. Among them were Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons; §3 Joanna, the wife of Chuza, Herod's business manager; Susanna; and many others who were contributing from their own resources to support Jesus and his disciples. §[Parable of the Farmer Scattering Seed] 4 One day Jesus told a story in the form of a parable to a large crowd that had gathered from many towns to hear him: §5 "A farmer went out to plant his seed. As he scattered it across his field, some seed fell on a footpath, where it was stepped on, and the birds ate it.  §6 Other seed fell among rocks. It began to grow, but the plant soon wilted and died for lack of moisture.  §7 Other seed fell among thorns that grew up with it and choked out the tender plants.  §8 Still other seed fell on fertile soil. This seed grew and produced a crop that was a hundred times as much as had been planted!"  When he had said this, he called out, "Anyone with ears to hear should listen and understand." 9 His disciples asked him what this parable meant. §10 He replied, "You are permitted to understand the secrets* of the Kingdom of God. But I use parables to teach the others so that the Scriptures might be fulfilled:  "When they look, they won't really see.  When they hear, they won't understand.'*"This is the meaning of the parable: The seed is God's word.  §12 The seeds that fell on the footpath represent those who hear the message, only to have the devil come and take it away from their hearts and prevent them from believing and being saved.  §13 The seeds on the rocky soil represent those who hear the message and receive it with joy. But since they don't have deep roots, they believe for a while, then they fall away when they face temptation.  §14 The seeds that fell among the thorns represent those who hear the message, but all too quickly the message is crowded out by the cares and riches and pleasures of this life. And so they never grow into maturity.  §15 And the seeds that fell on the good soil represent honest, good-hearted people who hear God's word, cling to it, and patiently produce a huge harvest.  §[Parable of the Lamp] 16 "No one lights a lamp and then covers it with a bowl or hides it under a bed. A lamp is placed on a stand, where its light can be seen by all who enter the house.  §17 For all that is secret will eventually be brought into the open, and everything that is concealed will be brought to light and made known to all. 18 "So pay attention to how you hear. To those who listen to my teaching, more understanding will be given. But for those who are not listening, even what they think they understand will be taken away from them."  §[The True Family of Jesus] 19 Then Jesus' mother and brothers came to see him, but they couldn't get to him because of the crowd. §20 Someone told Jesus, "Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, and they want to see you."§21 Jesus replied, "My mother and my brothers are all those who hear God's word and obey it."  §[Jesus Calms the Storm] 22 One day Jesus said to his disciples, "Let's cross to the other side of the lake."  So they got into a boat and started out. §23 As they sailed across, Jesus settled down for a nap. But soon a fierce storm came down on the lake. The boat was filling with water, and they were in real danger.§24 The disciples went and woke him up, shouting, "Master, Master, we're going to drown!" When Jesus woke up, he rebuked the wind and the raging waves. Suddenly the storm stopped and all was calm. §25 Then he asked them, "Where is your faith?"  The disciples were terrified and amazed. "Who is this man?" they asked each other. "When he gives a command, even the wind and waves obey him!" §[Jesus Heals a Demon-Possessed Man] 26 So they arrived in the region of the Gerasenes,* across the lake from Galilee. §27 As Jesus was climbing out of the boat, a man who was possessed by demons came out to meet him. For a long time he had been homeless and naked, living in the tombs outside the town.§28 As soon as he saw Jesus, he shrieked and fell down in front of him. Then he screamed, "Why are you interfering with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? Please, I beg you, don't torture me!" §29 For Jesus had already commanded the evil* spirit to come out of him. This spirit had often taken control of the man. Even when he was placed under guard and put in chains and shackles, he simply broke them and rushed out into the wilderness, completely under the demon's power.§30 Jesus demanded, "What is your name?"  "Legion," he replied, for he was filled with many demons. §31 The demons kept begging Jesus not to send them into the bottomless pit.*There happened to be a large herd of pigs feeding on the hillside nearby, and the demons begged him to let them enter into the pigs. So Jesus gave them permission. §33 Then the demons came out of the man and entered the pigs, and the entire herd plunged down the steep hillside into the lake and drowned.§34 When the herdsmen saw it, they fled to the nearby town and the surrounding countryside, spreading the news as they ran. §35 People rushed out to see what had happened. A crowd soon gathered around Jesus, and they saw the man who had been freed from the demons. He was sitting at Jesus' feet, fully clothed and perfectly sane, and they were all afraid. §36 Then those who had seen what happened told the others how the demon-possessed man had been healed. §37 And all the people in the region of the Gerasenes begged Jesus to go away and leave them alone, for a great wave of fear swept over them. So Jesus returned to the boat and left, crossing back to the other side of the lake. §38 The man who had been freed from the demons begged to go with him. But Jesus sent him home, saying, §39 "No, go back to your family, and tell them everything God has done for you."  So he went all through the town proclaiming the great things Jesus had done for him. §[Jesus Heals in Response to Faith] 40 On the other side of the lake the crowds welcomed Jesus, because they had been waiting for him. §41 Then a man named Jairus, a leader of the local synagogue, came and fell at Jesus' feet, pleading with him to come home with him. §42 His only daughter,* who was about twelve years old, was dying. As Jesus went with him, he was surrounded by the crowds. §43 A woman in the crowd had suffered for twelve years with constant bleeding,* and she could find no cure. §44 Coming up behind Jesus, she touched the fringe of his robe. Immediately, the bleeding stopped.§45 "Who touched me?"  Jesus asked. Everyone denied it, and Peter said, "Master, this whole crowd is pressing up against you."§46 But Jesus said, "Someone deliberately touched me, for I felt healing power go out from me."  §47 When the woman realized that she could not stay hidden, she began to tremble and fell to her knees in front of him. The whole crowd heard her explain why she had touched him and that she had been immediately healed. §48 "Daughter,"  he said to her, "your faith has made you well. Go in peace." 49 While he was still speaking to her, a messenger arrived from the home of Jairus, the leader of the synagogue. He told him, "Your daughter is dead. There's no use troubling the Teacher now."§50 But when Jesus heard what had happened, he said to Jairus, "Don't be afraid. Just have faith, and she will be healed." 51 When they arrived at the house, Jesus wouldn't let anyone go in with him except Peter, John, James, and the little girl's father and mother. §52 The house was filled with people weeping and wailing, but he said, "Stop the weeping! She isn't dead; she's only asleep." 53 But the crowd laughed at him because they all knew she had died. §54 Then Jesus took her by the hand and said in a loud voice, "My child, get up!"  §55 And at that moment her life* returned, and she immediately stood up! Then Jesus told them to give her something to eat. §56 Her parents were overwhelmed, but Jesus insisted that they not tell anyone what had happened.       §§Footnotes:§ 8:10a Greek mysteries.  § 8:10b Isa 6:9 (Greek version).  11 § 8:26 Other manuscripts read Gadarenes; still others read Gergesenes; also in 8:37.

NLT/Luke 9	[Jesus Sends Out the Twelve Disciples] 1 One day Jesus called together his twelve disciples* and gave them power and authority to cast out all demons and to heal all diseases. §2 Then he sent them out to tell everyone about the Kingdom of God and to heal the sick. §3 "Take nothing for your journey,"  he instructed them. "Don't take a walking stick, a traveler's bag, food, money,* or even a change of clothes.  §4 Wherever you go, stay in the same house until you leave town.  §5 And if a town refuses to welcome you, shake its dust from your feet as you leave to show that you have abandoned those people to their fate." 6 So they began their circuit of the villages, preaching the Good News and healing the sick. §[Herod's Confusion] 7 When Herod Antipas, the ruler of Galilee,* heard about everything Jesus was doing, he was puzzled. Some were saying that John the Baptist had been raised from the dead. §8 Others thought Jesus was Elijah or one of the other prophets risen from the dead.§9 "I beheaded John," Herod said, "so who is this man about whom I hear such stories?" And he kept trying to see him. §[Jesus Feeds Five Thousand] 10 When the apostles returned, they told Jesus everything they had done. Then he slipped quietly away with them toward the town of Bethsaida. §11 But the crowds found out where he was going, and they followed him. He welcomed them and taught them about the Kingdom of God, and he healed those who were sick.§12 Late in the afternoon the twelve disciples came to him and said, "Send the crowds away to the nearby villages and farms, so they can find food and lodging for the night. There is nothing to eat here in this remote place."§13 But Jesus said, "You feed them."  "But we have only five loaves of bread and two fish," they answered. "Or are you expecting us to go and buy enough food for this whole crowd?" §14 For there were about 5,000 men there. Jesus replied, "Tell them to sit down in groups of about fifty each."  §15 So the people all sat down. §16 Jesus took the five loaves and two fish, looked up toward heaven, and blessed them. Then, breaking the loaves into pieces, he kept giving the bread and fish to the disciples so they could distribute it to the people. §17 They all ate as much as they wanted, and afterward, the disciples picked up twelve baskets of leftovers! §[Peter's Declaration about Jesus] 18 One day Jesus left the crowds to pray alone. Only his disciples were with him, and he asked them, "Who do people say I am?" 19 "Well," they replied, "some say John the Baptist, some say Elijah, and others say you are one of the other ancient prophets risen from the dead."§20 Then he asked them, "But who do you say I am?"  Peter replied, "You are the Messiah* sent from God!" §[Jesus Predicts His Death] 21 Jesus warned his disciples not to tell anyone who he was. §22 "The Son of Man* must suffer many terrible things,"  he said. "He will be rejected by the elders, the leading priests, and the teachers of religious law. He will be killed, but on the third day he will be raised from the dead." 23 Then he said to the crowd, "If any of you wants to be my follower, you must give up your own way, take up your cross daily, and follow me.  §24 If you try to hang on to your life, you will lose it. But if you give up your life for my sake, you will save it.  §25 And what do you benefit if you gain the whole world but are yourself lost or destroyed?  §26 If anyone is ashamed of me and my message, the Son of Man will be ashamed of that person when he returns in his glory and in the glory of the Father and the holy angels.  §27 I tell you the truth, some standing here right now will not die before they see the Kingdom of God."  §[The Transfiguration] 28 About eight days later Jesus took Peter, John, and James up on a mountain to pray. §29 And as he was praying, the appearance of his face was transformed, and his clothes became dazzling white. §30 Suddenly, two men, Moses and Elijah, appeared and began talking with Jesus. §31 They were glorious to see. And they were speaking about his exodus from this world, which was about to be fulfilled in Jerusalem.§32 Peter and the others had fallen asleep. When they woke up, they saw Jesus' glory and the two men standing with him. §33 As Moses and Elijah were starting to leave, Peter, not even knowing what he was saying, blurted out, "Master, it's wonderful for us to be here! Let's make three shelters as memorials*-one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah." §34 But even as he was saying this, a cloud overshadowed them, and terror gripped them as the cloud covered them.§35 Then a voice from the cloud said, "This is my Son, my Chosen One.* Listen to him." §36 When the voice finished, Jesus was there alone. They didn't tell anyone at that time what they had seen. §[Jesus Heals a Demon-Possessed Boy] 37 The next day, after they had come down the mountain, a large crowd met Jesus. §38 A man in the crowd called out to him, "Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, my only child. §39 An evil spirit keeps seizing him, making him scream. It throws him into convulsions so that he foams at the mouth. It batters him and hardly ever leaves him alone. §40 I begged your disciples to cast out the spirit, but they couldn't do it."§41 Jesus said, "You faithless and corrupt people! How long must I be with you and put up with you?"  Then he said to the man, "Bring your son here." 42 As the boy came forward, the demon knocked him to the ground and threw him into a violent convulsion. But Jesus rebuked the evil* spirit and healed the boy. Then he gave him back to his father. §43 Awe gripped the people as they saw this majestic display of God's power. §[Jesus Again Predicts His Death] While everyone was marveling at everything he was doing, Jesus said to his disciples, §44 "Listen to me and remember what I say. The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of his enemies."  §45 But they didn't know what he meant. Its significance was hidden from them, so they couldn't understand it, and they were afraid to ask him about it. §[The Greatest in the Kingdom] 46 Then his disciples began arguing about which of them was the greatest. §47 But Jesus knew their thoughts, so he brought a little child to his side. §48 Then he said to them, "Anyone who welcomes a little child like this on my behalf* welcomes me, and anyone who welcomes me also welcomes my Father who sent me. Whoever is the least among you is the greatest."  §[Using the Name of Jesus] 49 John said to Jesus, "Master, we saw someone using your name to cast out demons, but we told him to stop because he isn't in our group."§50 But Jesus said, "Don't stop him! Anyone who is not against you is for you."  §[Opposition from Samaritans] 51 As the time drew near for him to ascend to heaven, Jesus resolutely set out for Jerusalem. §52 He sent messengers ahead to a Samaritan village to prepare for his arrival. §53 But the people of the village did not welcome Jesus because he was on his way to Jerusalem. §54 When James and John saw this, they said to Jesus, "Lord, should we call down fire from heaven to burn them up*?" §55 But Jesus turned and rebuked them.* §56 So they went on to another village. §[The Cost of Following Jesus] 57 As they were walking along, someone said to Jesus, "I will follow you wherever you go."§58 But Jesus replied, "Foxes have dens to live in, and birds have nests, but the Son of Man has no place even to lay his head." 59 He said to another person, "Come, follow me."  The man agreed, but he said, "Lord, first let me return home and bury my father."§60 But Jesus told him, "Let the spiritually dead bury their own dead!* Your duty is to go and preach about the Kingdom of God." 61 Another said, "Yes, Lord, I will follow you, but first let me say good-bye to my family."§62 But Jesus told him, "Anyone who puts a hand to the plow and then looks back is not fit for the Kingdom of God."        §§Footnotes:§ 9:1 Greek the Twelve; other manuscripts read the twelve apostles.  § 9:3 Or silver coins.  § 9:7 Greek Herod the tetrarch.

NLT/John 1	[Prologue: Christ, the Eternal Word] 1 In the beginning the Word already existed. The Word was with God, and the Word was God.§2 He existed in the beginning with God.§3 God created everything through him, and nothing was created except through him.§4 The Word gave life to everything that was created,*and his life brought light to everyone.§5 The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness can never extinguish it.*God sent a man, John the Baptist,* §7 to tell about the light so that everyone might believe because of his testimony. §8 John himself was not the light; he was simply a witness to tell about the light. §9 The one who is the true light, who gives light to everyone, was coming into the world.§10 He came into the very world he created, but the world didn't recognize him. §11 He came to his own people, and even they rejected him. §12 But to all who believed him and accepted him, he gave the right to become children of God. §13 They are reborn-not with a physical birth resulting from human passion or plan, but a birth that comes from God.§14 So the Word became human* and made his home among us. He was full of unfailing love and faithfulness.* And we have seen his glory, the glory of the Father's one and only Son.§15 John testified about him when he shouted to the crowds, "This is the one I was talking about when I said, "Someone is coming after me who is far greater than I am, for he existed long before me.'"§16 From his abundance we have all received one gracious blessing after another.* §17 For the law was given through Moses, but God's unfailing love and faithfulness came through Jesus Christ. §18 No one has ever seen God. But the unique One, who is himself God,* is near to the Father's heart. He has revealed God to us. §[The Testimony of John the Baptist] 19 This was John's testimony when the Jewish leaders sent priests and Temple assistants* from Jerusalem to ask John, "Who are you?" §20 He came right out and said, "I am not the Messiah."§21 "Well then, who are you?" they asked. "Are you Elijah?" "No," he replied. "Are you the Prophet we are expecting?"*"No."§22 "Then who are you? We need an answer for those who sent us. What do you have to say about yourself?"§23 John replied in the words of the prophet Isaiah:  "I am a voice shouting in the wilderness, "Clear the way for the Lord 's coming!'"*Then the Pharisees who had been sent §25 asked him, "If you aren't the Messiah or Elijah or the Prophet, what right do you have to baptize?"§26 John told them, "I baptize with* water, but right here in the crowd is someone you do not recognize. §27 Though his ministry follows mine, I'm not even worthy to be his slave and untie the straps of his sandal."§28 This encounter took place in Bethany, an area east of the Jordan River, where John was baptizing. §[Jesus, the Lamb of God] 29 The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, "Look! The Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world! §30 He is the one I was talking about when I said, "A man is coming after me who is far greater than I am, for he existed long before me.' §31 I did not recognize him as the Messiah, but I have been baptizing with water so that he might be revealed to Israel."§32 Then John testified, "I saw the Holy Spirit descending like a dove from heaven and resting upon him. §33 I didn't know he was the one, but when God sent me to baptize with water, he told me, "The one on whom you see the Spirit descend and rest is the one who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.' §34 I saw this happen to Jesus, so I testify that he is the Chosen One of God.*" §[The First Disciples] 35 The following day John was again standing with two of his disciples. §36 As Jesus walked by, John looked at him and declared, "Look! There is the Lamb of God!" §37 When John's two disciples heard this, they followed Jesus.§38 Jesus looked around and saw them following. "What do you want?"  he asked them. They replied, "Rabbi" (which means "Teacher"), "where are you staying?"§39 "Come and see,"  he said. It was about four o'clock in the afternoon when they went with him to the place where he was staying, and they remained with him the rest of the day.§40 Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of these men who heard what John said and then followed Jesus. §41 Andrew went to find his brother, Simon, and told him, "We have found the Messiah" (which means "Christ"*).§42 Then Andrew brought Simon to meet Jesus. Looking intently at Simon, Jesus said, "Your name is Simon, son of John-but you will be called Cephas"  (which means "Peter"*).§43 The next day Jesus decided to go to Galilee. He found Philip and said to him, "Come, follow me."  §44 Philip was from Bethsaida, Andrew and Peter's hometown.§45 Philip went to look for Nathanael and told him, "We have found the very person Moses* and the prophets wrote about! His name is Jesus, the son of Joseph from Nazareth."§46 "Nazareth!" exclaimed Nathanael. "Can anything good come from Nazareth?" "Come and see for yourself," Philip replied.§47 As they approached, Jesus said, "Now here is a genuine son of Israel-a man of complete integrity." 48 "How do you know about me?" Nathanael asked. Jesus replied, "I could see you under the fig tree before Philip found you." 49 Then Nathanael exclaimed, "Rabbi, you are the Son of God-the King of Israel!"§50 Jesus asked him, "Do you believe this just because I told you I had seen you under the fig tree? You will see greater things than this."  §51 Then he said, "I tell you the truth, you will all see heaven open and the angels of God going up and down on the Son of Man, the one who is the stairway between heaven and earth.*"        §§Footnotes:§ 1:3-4 Or and nothing that was created was created except through him.

NLT/John 10	[The Good Shepherd and His Sheep] 1 "I tell you the truth, anyone who sneaks over the wall of a sheepfold, rather than going through the gate, must surely be a thief and a robber!  §2 But the one who enters through the gate is the shepherd of the sheep.  §3 The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep recognize his voice and come to him. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.  §4 After he has gathered his own flock, he walks ahead of them, and they follow him because they know his voice.  §5 They won't follow a stranger; they will run from him because they don't know his voice." 6 Those who heard Jesus use this illustration didn't understand what he meant, §7 so he explained it to them: "I tell you the truth, I am the gate for the sheep.  §8 All who came before me* were thieves and robbers. But the true sheep did not listen to them.  §9 Yes, I am the gate. Those who come in through me will be saved.* They will come and go freely and will find good pastures.  §10 The thief's purpose is to steal and kill and destroy. My purpose is to give them a rich and satisfying life. 11 "I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd sacrifices his life for the sheep.  §12 A hired hand will run when he sees a wolf coming. He will abandon the sheep because they don't belong to him and he isn't their shepherd. And so the wolf attacks them and scatters the flock.  §13 The hired hand runs away because he's working only for the money and doesn't really care about the sheep. 14 "I am the good shepherd; I know my own sheep, and they know me,  §15 just as my Father knows me and I know the Father. So I sacrifice my life for the sheep.  §16 I have other sheep, too, that are not in this sheepfold. I must bring them also. They will listen to my voice, and there will be one flock with one shepherd. 17 "The Father loves me because I sacrifice my life so I may take it back again.  §18 No one can take my life from me. I sacrifice it voluntarily. For I have the authority to lay it down when I want to and also to take it up again. For this is what my Father has commanded." 19 When he said these things, the people* were again divided in their opinions about him. §20 Some said, "He's demon possessed and out of his mind. Why listen to a man like that?" §21 Others said, "This doesn't sound like a man possessed by a demon! Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?" §[Jesus Claims to Be the Son of God] 22 It was now winter, and Jesus was in Jerusalem at the time of Hanukkah, the Festival of Dedication. §23 He was in the Temple, walking through the section known as Solomon's Colonnade. §24 The people surrounded him and asked, "How long are you going to keep us in suspense? If you are the Messiah, tell us plainly."§25 Jesus replied, "I have already told you, and you don't believe me. The proof is the work I do in my Father's name.  §26 But you don't believe me because you are not my sheep.  §27 My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me.  §28 I give them eternal life, and they will never perish. No one can snatch them away from me,  §29 for my Father has given them to me, and he is more powerful than anyone else.* No one can snatch them from the Father's hand.  §30 The Father and I are one." 31 Once again the people picked up stones to kill him. §32 Jesus said, "At my Father's direction I have done many good works. For which one are you going to stone me?" 33 They replied, "We're stoning you not for any good work, but for blasphemy! You, a mere man, claim to be God."§34 Jesus replied, "It is written in your own Scriptures* that God said to certain leaders of the people, "I say, you are gods!'* §35 And you know that the Scriptures cannot be altered. So if those people who received God's message were called "gods,'  §36 why do you call it blasphemy when I say, "I am the Son of God'? After all, the Father set me apart and sent me into the world.  §37 Don't believe me unless I carry out my Father's work.  §38 But if I do his work, believe in the evidence of the miraculous works I have done, even if you don't believe me. Then you will know and understand that the Father is in me, and I am in the Father." 39 Once again they tried to arrest him, but he got away and left them. §40 He went beyond the Jordan River near the place where John was first baptizing and stayed there awhile. §41 And many followed him. "John didn't perform miraculous signs," they remarked to one another, "but everything he said about this man has come true." §42 And many who were there believed in Jesus.       §§Footnotes:§ 10:8 Some manuscripts do not include before me.  § 10:9 Or will find safety.  § 10:19 Greek Jewish people; also in 10:24, 31.  § 10:29 Other manuscripts read for what my Father has given me is more powerful than anything; still others read for regarding that which my Father has given me, he is greater than all.  § 10:34a Greek your own law.  § 10:34b Ps 82:6.  §
NLT/John 11	[The Raising of Lazarus] 1 A man named Lazarus was sick. He lived in Bethany with his sisters, Mary and Martha. §2 This is the Mary who later poured the expensive perfume on the Lord's feet and wiped them with her hair.* Her brother, Lazarus, was sick. §3 So the two sisters sent a message to Jesus telling him, "Lord, your dear friend is very sick."§4 But when Jesus heard about it he said, "Lazarus's sickness will not end in death. No, it happened for the glory of God so that the Son of God will receive glory from this."  §5 So although Jesus loved Martha, Mary, and Lazarus, §6 he stayed where he was for the next two days. §7 Finally, he said to his disciples, "Let's go back to Judea." 8 But his disciples objected. "Rabbi," they said, "only a few days ago the people* in Judea were trying to stone you. Are you going there again?"§9 Jesus replied, "There are twelve hours of daylight every day. During the day people can walk safely. They can see because they have the light of this world.  §10 But at night there is danger of stumbling because they have no light."  §11 Then he said, "Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but now I will go and wake him up." 12 The disciples said, "Lord, if he is sleeping, he will soon get better!" §13 They thought Jesus meant Lazarus was simply sleeping, but Jesus meant Lazarus had died.§14 So he told them plainly, "Lazarus is dead.  §15 And for your sakes, I'm glad I wasn't there, for now you will really believe. Come, let's go see him." 16 Thomas, nicknamed the Twin,* said to his fellow disciples, "Let's go, too-and die with Jesus."§17 When Jesus arrived at Bethany, he was told that Lazarus had already been in his grave for four days. §18 Bethany was only a few miles* down the road from Jerusalem, §19 and many of the people had come to console Martha and Mary in their loss. §20 When Martha got word that Jesus was coming, she went to meet him. But Mary stayed in the house. §21 Martha said to Jesus, "Lord, if only you had been here, my brother would not have died. §22 But even now I know that God will give you whatever you ask."§23 Jesus told her, "Your brother will rise again." 24 "Yes," Martha said, "he will rise when everyone else rises, at the last day."§25 Jesus told her, "I am the resurrection and the life.* Anyone who believes in me will live, even after dying.  §26 Everyone who lives in me and believes in me will never ever die. Do you believe this, Martha?" 27 "Yes, Lord," she told him. "I have always believed you are the Messiah, the Son of God, the one who has come into the world from God." §28 Then she returned to Mary. She called Mary aside from the mourners and told her, "The Teacher is here and wants to see you." §29 So Mary immediately went to him.§30 Jesus had stayed outside the village, at the place where Martha met him. §31 When the people who were at the house consoling Mary saw her leave so hastily, they assumed she was going to Lazarus's grave to weep. So they followed her there. §32 When Mary arrived and saw Jesus, she fell at his feet and said, "Lord, if only you had been here, my brother would not have died."§33 When Jesus saw her weeping and saw the other people wailing with her, a deep anger welled up within him,* and he was deeply troubled. §34 "Where have you put him?"  he asked them. They told him, "Lord, come and see." §35 Then Jesus wept. §36 The people who were standing nearby said, "See how much he loved him!" §37 But some said, "This man healed a blind man. Couldn't he have kept Lazarus from dying?"§38 Jesus was still angry as he arrived at the tomb, a cave with a stone rolled across its entrance. §39 "Roll the stone aside,"  Jesus told them. But Martha, the dead man's sister, protested, "Lord, he has been dead for four days. The smell will be terrible."§40 Jesus responded, "Didn't I tell you that you would see God's glory if you believe?"  §41 So they rolled the stone aside. Then Jesus looked up to heaven and said, "Father, thank you for hearing me.  §42 You always hear me, but I said it out loud for the sake of all these people standing here, so that they will believe you sent me."  §43 Then Jesus shouted, "Lazarus, come out!"  §44 And the dead man came out, his hands and feet bound in graveclothes, his face wrapped in a headcloth. Jesus told them, "Unwrap him and let him go!"  §[The Plot to Kill Jesus] 45 Many of the people who were with Mary believed in Jesus when they saw this happen. §46 But some went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done. §47 Then the leading priests and Pharisees called the high council* together. "What are we going to do?" they asked each other. "This man certainly performs many miraculous signs. §48 If we allow him to go on like this, soon everyone will believe in him. Then the Roman army will come and destroy both our Temple* and our nation."§49 Caiaphas, who was high priest at that time,* said, "You don't know what you're talking about! §50 You don't realize that it's better for you that one man should die for the people than for the whole nation to be destroyed."§51 He did not say this on his own; as high priest at that time he was led to prophesy that Jesus would die for the entire nation. §52 And not only for that nation, but to bring together and unite all the children of God scattered around the world.§53 So from that time on, the Jewish leaders began to plot Jesus' death. §54 As a result, Jesus stopped his public ministry among the people and left Jerusalem. He went to a place near the wilderness, to the village of Ephraim, and stayed there with his disciples.§55 It was now almost time for the Jewish Passover celebration, and many people from all over the country arrived in Jerusalem several days early so they could go through the purification ceremony before Passover began. §56 They kept looking for Jesus, but as they stood around in the Temple, they said to each other, "What do you think? He won't come for Passover, will he?" §57 Meanwhile, the leading priests and Pharisees had publicly ordered that anyone seeing Jesus must report it immediately so they could arrest him.       §§Footnotes:§ 11:2 This incident is recorded in chapter 12.  § 11:8 Greek Jewish people; also in 11:19, 31, 33, 36, 45, 54.  § 11:16 Greek Thomas, who was called Didymus.  § 11:18 Greek was about 15 stadia [about 2.8 kilometers].  § 11:25 Some manuscripts do not include and the life.  § 11:33 Or he was angry in his spirit.  § 11:47 Greek the Sanhedrin.  § 11:48 Or our position; Greek reads our place.  § 11:49 Greek that year; also in 11:51.  §
NLT/John 12	[Jesus Anointed at Bethany] 1 Six days before the Passover celebration began, Jesus arrived in Bethany, the home of Lazarus-the man he had raised from the dead. §2 A dinner was prepared in Jesus' honor. Martha served, and Lazarus was among those who ate* with him. §3 Then Mary took a twelve-ounce jar* of expensive perfume made from essence of nard, and she anointed Jesus' feet with it, wiping his feet with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance.§4 But Judas Iscariot, the disciple who would soon betray him, said, §5 "That perfume was worth a year's wages.* It should have been sold and the money given to the poor." §6 Not that he cared for the poor-he was a thief, and since he was in charge of the disciples' money, he often stole some for himself.§7 Jesus replied, "Leave her alone. She did this in preparation for my burial.  §8 You will always have the poor among you, but you will not always have me." 9 When all the people* heard of Jesus' arrival, they flocked to see him and also to see Lazarus, the man Jesus had raised from the dead. §10 Then the leading priests decided to kill Lazarus, too, §11 for it was because of him that many of the people had deserted them* and believed in Jesus. §[Jesus' Triumphant Entry] 12 The next day, the news that Jesus was on the way to Jerusalem swept through the city. A large crowd of Passover visitors §13 took palm branches and went down the road to meet him. They shouted,  "Praise God!*Blessings on the one who comes in the name of the Lord ! Hail to the King of Israel!"*Jesus found a young donkey and rode on it, fulfilling the prophecy that said:§15 "Don't be afraid, people of Jerusalem.*Look, your King is coming, riding on a donkey's colt."*His disciples didn't understand at the time that this was a fulfillment of prophecy. But after Jesus entered into his glory, they remembered what had happened and realized that these things had been written about him.§17 Many in the crowd had seen Jesus call Lazarus from the tomb, raising him from the dead, and they were telling others* about it. §18 That was the reason so many went out to meet him-because they had heard about this miraculous sign. §19 Then the Pharisees said to each other, "There's nothing we can do. Look, everyone* has gone after him!" §[Jesus Predicts His Death] 20 Some Greeks who had come to Jerusalem for the Passover celebration §21 paid a visit to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee. They said, "Sir, we want to meet Jesus." §22 Philip told Andrew about it, and they went together to ask Jesus.§23 Jesus replied, "Now the time has come for the Son of Man* to enter into his glory.  §24 I tell you the truth, unless a kernel of wheat is planted in the soil and dies, it remains alone. But its death will produce many new kernels-a plentiful harvest of new lives.  §25 Those who love their life in this world will lose it. Those who care nothing for their life in this world will keep it for eternity.  §26 Anyone who wants to serve me must follow me, because my servants must be where I am. And the Father will honor anyone who serves me. 27 "Now my soul is deeply troubled. Should I pray, "Father, save me from this hour'? But this is the very reason I came!  §28 Father, bring glory to your name."  Then a voice spoke from heaven, saying, "I have already brought glory to my name, and I will do so again." §29 When the crowd heard the voice, some thought it was thunder, while others declared an angel had spoken to him.§30 Then Jesus told them, "The voice was for your benefit, not mine.  §31 The time for judging this world has come, when Satan, the ruler of this world, will be cast out.  §32 And when I am lifted up from the earth, I will draw everyone to myself."  §33 He said this to indicate how he was going to die.§34 The crowd responded, "We understood from Scripture* that the Messiah would live forever. How can you say the Son of Man will die? Just who is this Son of Man, anyway?"§35 Jesus replied, "My light will shine for you just a little longer. Walk in the light while you can, so the darkness will not overtake you. Those who walk in the darkness cannot see where they are going.  §36 Put your trust in the light while there is still time; then you will become children of the light."  After saying these things, Jesus went away and was hidden from them. §[The Unbelief of the People] 37 But despite all the miraculous signs Jesus had done, most of the people still did not believe in him. §38 This is exactly what Isaiah the prophet had predicted:  " Lord , who has believed our message? To whom has the Lord  revealed his powerful arm?"*But the people couldn't believe, for as Isaiah also said,§40 "The Lord has blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts- so that their eyes cannot see, and their hearts cannot understand, and they cannot turn to me and have me heal them."*Isaiah was referring to Jesus when he said this, because he saw the future and spoke of the Messiah's glory. §42 Many people did believe in him, however, including some of the Jewish leaders. But they wouldn't admit it for fear that the Pharisees would expel them from the synagogue. §43 For they loved human praise more than the praise of God.§44 Jesus shouted to the crowds, "If you trust me, you are trusting not only me, but also God who sent me.  §45 For when you see me, you are seeing the one who sent me.  §46 I have come as a light to shine in this dark world, so that all who put their trust in me will no longer remain in the dark.  §47 I will not judge those who hear me but don't obey me, for I have come to save the world and not to judge it.  §48 But all who reject me and my message will be judged on the day of judgment by the truth I have spoken.  §49 I don't speak on my own authority. The Father who sent me has commanded me what to say and how to say it.  §50 And I know his commands lead to eternal life; so I say whatever the Father tells me to say."        §§Footnotes:§ 12:2 Or who reclined.  § 12:3 Greek took 1 litra [327 grams].  § 12:5 Greek worth 300 denarii.

NLT/John 13	[Jesus Washes His Disciples' Feet] 1 Before the Passover celebration, Jesus knew that his hour had come to leave this world and return to his Father. He had loved his disciples during his ministry on earth, and now he loved them to the very end.* §2 It was time for supper, and the devil had already prompted Judas,* son of Simon Iscariot, to betray Jesus. §3 Jesus knew that the Father had given him authority over everything and that he had come from God and would return to God. §4 So he got up from the table, took off his robe, wrapped a towel around his waist, §5 and poured water into a basin. Then he began to wash the disciples' feet, drying them with the towel he had around him.§6 When Jesus came to Simon Peter, Peter said to him, "Lord, are you going to wash my feet?"§7 Jesus replied, "You don't understand now what I am doing, but someday you will." 8 "No," Peter protested, "you will never ever wash my feet!" Jesus replied, "Unless I wash you, you won't belong to me." 9 Simon Peter exclaimed, "Then wash my hands and head as well, Lord, not just my feet!"§10 Jesus replied, "A person who has bathed all over does not need to wash, except for the feet,* to be entirely clean. And you disciples are clean, but not all of you."  §11 For Jesus knew who would betray him. That is what he meant when he said, "Not all of you are clean." 12 After washing their feet, he put on his robe again and sat down and asked, "Do you understand what I was doing?  §13 You call me "Teacher' and "Lord,' and you are right, because that's what I am.  §14 And since I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you ought to wash each other's feet.  §15 I have given you an example to follow. Do as I have done to you.  §16 I tell you the truth, slaves are not greater than their master. Nor is the messenger more important than the one who sends the message.  §17 Now that you know these things, God will bless you for doing them.  §[Jesus Predicts His Betrayal] 18 "I am not saying these things to all of you; I know the ones I have chosen. But this fulfills the Scripture that says, "The one who eats my food has turned against me.'* §19 I tell you this beforehand, so that when it happens you will believe that  I Am  the Messiah.* §20 I tell you the truth, anyone who welcomes my messenger is welcoming me, and anyone who welcomes me is welcoming the Father who sent me." 21 Now Jesus was deeply troubled,* and he exclaimed, "I tell you the truth, one of you will betray me!" 22 The disciples looked at each other, wondering whom he could mean. §23 The disciple Jesus loved was sitting next to Jesus at the table.* §24 Simon Peter motioned to him to ask, "Who's he talking about?" §25 So that disciple leaned over to Jesus and asked, "Lord, who is it?"§26 Jesus responded, "It is the one to whom I give the bread I dip in the bowl."  And when he had dipped it, he gave it to Judas, son of Simon Iscariot. §27 When Judas had eaten the bread, Satan entered into him. Then Jesus told him, "Hurry and do what you're going to do."  §28 None of the others at the table knew what Jesus meant. §29 Since Judas was their treasurer, some thought Jesus was telling him to go and pay for the food or to give some money to the poor. §30 So Judas left at once, going out into the night. §[Jesus Predicts Peter's Denial] 31 As soon as Judas left the room, Jesus said, "The time has come for the Son of Man* to enter into his glory, and God will be glorified because of him.  §32 And since God receives glory because of the Son,* he will give his own glory to the Son, and he will do so at once.  §33 Dear children, I will be with you only a little longer. And as I told the Jewish leaders, you will search for me, but you can't come where I am going.  §34 So now I am giving you a new commandment: Love each other. Just as I have loved you, you should love each other.  §35 Your love for one another will prove to the world that you are my disciples." 36 Simon Peter asked, "Lord, where are you going?" And Jesus replied, "You can't go with me now, but you will follow me later." 37 "But why can't I come now, Lord?" he asked. "I'm ready to die for you."§38 Jesus answered, "Die for me? I tell you the truth, Peter-before the rooster crows tomorrow morning, you will deny three times that you even know me.        §§Footnotes:§ 13:1 Or he showed them the full extent of his love.  § 13:2 Or the devil had already intended for Judas.  § 13:10 Some manuscripts do not include except for the feet.  § 13:18 Ps 41:9.  § 13:19 Or that the " I Am ' has come; or that I am the Lord ; Greek reads that I am. See Exod 3:14.  § 13:21 Greek was troubled in his spirit.  § 13:23 Greek was reclining on Jesus' bosom. The "disciple Jesus loved" was probably John.  § 13:31 "Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself.  § 13:32 Several early manuscripts do not include And since God receives glory because of the Son.  §
NLT/John 14	[Jesus, the Way to the Father] 1 "Don't let your hearts be troubled. Trust in God, and trust also in me.  §2 There is more than enough room in my Father's home.* If this were not so, would I have told you that I am going to prepare a place for you?* §3 When everything is ready, I will come and get you, so that you will always be with me where I am.  §4 And you know the way to where I am going." 5 "No, we don't know, Lord," Thomas said. "We have no idea where you are going, so how can we know the way?"§6 Jesus told him, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one can come to the Father except through me.  §7 If you had really known me, you would know who my Father is.* From now on, you do know him and have seen him!" 8 Philip said, "Lord, show us the Father, and we will be satisfied."§9 Jesus replied, "Have I been with you all this time, Philip, and yet you still don't know who I am? Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father! So why are you asking me to show him to you?  §10 Don't you believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words I speak are not my own, but my Father who lives in me does his work through me.  §11 Just believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me. Or at least believe because of the work you have seen me do. 12 "I tell you the truth, anyone who believes in me will do the same works I have done, and even greater works, because I am going to be with the Father.  §13 You can ask for anything in my name, and I will do it, so that the Son can bring glory to the Father.  §14 Yes, ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it!  §[Jesus Promises the Holy Spirit] 15 "If you love me, obey* my commandments.  §16 And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Advocate,* who will never leave you.  §17 He is the Holy Spirit, who leads into all truth. The world cannot receive him, because it isn't looking for him and doesn't recognize him. But you know him, because he lives with you now and later will be in you.* §18 No, I will not abandon you as orphans-I will come to you.  §19 Soon the world will no longer see me, but you will see me. Since I live, you also will live.  §20 When I am raised to life again, you will know that I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I am in you.  §21 Those who accept my commandments and obey them are the ones who love me. And because they love me, my Father will love them. And I will love them and reveal myself to each of them." 22 Judas (not Judas Iscariot, but the other disciple with that name) said to him, "Lord, why are you going to reveal yourself only to us and not to the world at large?"§23 Jesus replied, "All who love me will do what I say. My Father will love them, and we will come and make our home with each of them.  §24 Anyone who doesn't love me will not obey me. And remember, my words are not my own. What I am telling you is from the Father who sent me.  §25 I am telling you these things now while I am still with you.  §26 But when the Father sends the Advocate as my representative-that is, the Holy Spirit-he will teach you everything and will remind you of everything I have told you. 27 "I am leaving you with a gift-peace of mind and heart. And the peace I give is a gift the world cannot give. So don't be troubled or afraid.  §28 Remember what I told you: I am going away, but I will come back to you again. If you really loved me, you would be happy that I am going to the Father, who is greater than I am.  §29 I have told you these things before they happen so that when they do happen, you will believe. 30 "I don't have much more time to talk to you, because the ruler of this world approaches. He has no power over me,  §31 but I will do what the Father requires of me, so that the world will know that I love the Father. Come, let's be going.        §§Footnotes:§ 14:2a Or There are many rooms in my Father's house.  § 14:2b Or If this were not so, I would have told you that I am going to prepare a place for you.

NLT/John 15	[Jesus, the True Vine] 1 "I am the true grapevine, and my Father is the gardener.  §2 He cuts off every branch of mine that doesn't produce fruit, and he prunes the branches that do bear fruit so they will produce even more.  §3 You have already been pruned and purified by the message I have given you.  §4 Remain in me, and I will remain in you. For a branch cannot produce fruit if it is severed from the vine, and you cannot be fruitful unless you remain in me. 5 "Yes, I am the vine; you are the branches. Those who remain in me, and I in them, will produce much fruit. For apart from me you can do nothing.  §6 Anyone who does not remain in me is thrown away like a useless branch and withers. Such branches are gathered into a pile to be burned.  §7 But if you remain in me and my words remain in you, you may ask for anything you want, and it will be granted!  §8 When you produce much fruit, you are my true disciples. This brings great glory to my Father. 9 "I have loved you even as the Father has loved me. Remain in my love.  §10 When you obey my commandments, you remain in my love, just as I obey my Father's commandments and remain in his love.  §11 I have told you these things so that you will be filled with my joy. Yes, your joy will overflow!  §12 This is my commandment: Love each other in the same way I have loved you.  §13 There is no greater love than to lay down one's life for one's friends.  §14 You are my friends if you do what I command.  §15 I no longer call you slaves, because a master doesn't confide in his slaves. Now you are my friends, since I have told you everything the Father told me.  §16 You didn't choose me. I chose you. I appointed you to go and produce lasting fruit, so that the Father will give you whatever you ask for, using my name.  §17 This is my command: Love each other.  §[The World's Hatred] 18 "If the world hates you, remember that it hated me first.  §19 The world would love you as one of its own if you belonged to it, but you are no longer part of the world. I chose you to come out of the world, so it hates you.  §20 Do you remember what I told you? "A slave is not greater than the master.' Since they persecuted me, naturally they will persecute you. And if they had listened to me, they would listen to you.  §21 They will do all this to you because of me, for they have rejected the one who sent me.  §22 They would not be guilty if I had not come and spoken to them. But now they have no excuse for their sin.  §23 Anyone who hates me also hates my Father.  §24 If I hadn't done such miraculous signs among them that no one else could do, they would not be guilty. But as it is, they have seen everything I did, yet they still hate me and my Father.  §25 This fulfills what is written in their Scriptures*: "They hated me without cause.' 26 "But I will send you the Advocate*-the Spirit of truth. He will come to you from the Father and will testify all about me.  §27 And you must also testify about me because you have been with me from the beginning of my ministry.        §§Footnotes:§ 15:25 Greek in their law.

NLT/John 16	1 "I have told you these things so that you won't abandon your faith.  §2 For you will be expelled from the synagogues, and the time is coming when those who kill you will think they are doing a holy service for God.  §3 This is because they have never known the Father or me.  §4 Yes, I'm telling you these things now, so that when they happen, you will remember my warning. I didn't tell you earlier because I was going to be with you for a while longer.  §[The Work of the Holy Spirit] 5 "But now I am going away to the one who sent me, and not one of you is asking where I am going.  §6 Instead, you grieve because of what I've told you.  §7 But in fact, it is best for you that I go away, because if I don't, the Advocate* won't come. If I do go away, then I will send him to you.  §8 And when he comes, he will convict the world of its sin, and of God's righteousness, and of the coming judgment.  §9 The world's sin is that it refuses to believe in me.  §10 Righteousness is available because I go to the Father, and you will see me no more.  §11 Judgment will come because the ruler of this world has already been judged. 12 "There is so much more I want to tell you, but you can't bear it now.  §13 When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all truth. He will not speak on his own but will tell you what he has heard. He will tell you about the future.  §14 He will bring me glory by telling you whatever he receives from me.  §15 All that belongs to the Father is mine; this is why I said, "The Spirit will tell you whatever he receives from me.'  §[Sadness Will Be Turned to Joy] 16 "In a little while you won't see me anymore. But a little while after that, you will see me again." 17 Some of the disciples asked each other, "What does he mean when he says, "In a little while you won't see me, but then you will see me,' and "I am going to the Father'? §18 And what does he mean by "a little while'? We don't understand."§19 Jesus realized they wanted to ask him about it, so he said, "Are you asking yourselves what I meant? I said in a little while you won't see me, but a little while after that you will see me again.  §20 I tell you the truth, you will weep and mourn over what is going to happen to me, but the world will rejoice. You will grieve, but your grief will suddenly turn to wonderful joy.  §21 It will be like a woman suffering the pains of labor. When her child is born, her anguish gives way to joy because she has brought a new baby into the world.  §22 So you have sorrow now, but I will see you again; then you will rejoice, and no one can rob you of that joy.  §23 At that time you won't need to ask me for anything. I tell you the truth, you will ask the Father directly, and he will grant your request because you use my name.  §24 You haven't done this before. Ask, using my name, and you will receive, and you will have abundant joy. 25 "I have spoken of these matters in figures of speech, but soon I will stop speaking figuratively and will tell you plainly all about the Father.  §26 Then you will ask in my name. I'm not saying I will ask the Father on your behalf,  §27 for the Father himself loves you dearly because you love me and believe that I came from God.* §28 Yes, I came from the Father into the world, and now I will leave the world and return to the Father." 29 Then his disciples said, "At last you are speaking plainly and not figuratively. §30 Now we understand that you know everything, and there's no need to question you. From this we believe that you came from God."§31 Jesus asked, "Do you finally believe?  §32 But the time is coming-indeed it's here now-when you will be scattered, each one going his own way, leaving me alone. Yet I am not alone because the Father is with me.  §33 I have told you all this so that you may have peace in me. Here on earth you will have many trials and sorrows.

NLT/John 17	[The Prayer of Jesus] 1 After saying all these things, Jesus looked up to heaven and said, "Father, the hour has come. Glorify your Son so he can give glory back to you.  §2 For you have given him authority over everyone. He gives eternal life to each one you have given him.  §3 And this is the way to have eternal life-to know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, the one you sent to earth.  §4 I brought glory to you here on earth by completing the work you gave me to do.  §5 Now, Father, bring me into the glory we shared before the world began. 6 "I have revealed you* to the ones you gave me from this world. They were always yours. You gave them to me, and they have kept your word.  §7 Now they know that everything I have is a gift from you,  §8 for I have passed on to them the message you gave me. They accepted it and know that I came from you, and they believe you sent me. 9 "My prayer is not for the world, but for those you have given me, because they belong to you.  §10 All who are mine belong to you, and you have given them to me, so they bring me glory.  §11 Now I am departing from the world; they are staying in this world, but I am coming to you. Holy Father, you have given me your name;* now protect them by the power of your name so that they will be united just as we are.  §12 During my time here, I protected them by the power of the name you gave me.* I guarded them so that not one was lost, except the one headed for destruction, as the Scriptures foretold. 13 "Now I am coming to you. I told them many things while I was with them in this world so they would be filled with my joy.  §14 I have given them your word. And the world hates them because they do not belong to the world, just as I do not belong to the world.  §15 I'm not asking you to take them out of the world, but to keep them safe from the evil one.  §16 They do not belong to this world any more than I do.  §17 Make them holy by your truth; teach them your word, which is truth.  §18 Just as you sent me into the world, I am sending them into the world.  §19 And I give myself as a holy sacrifice for them so they can be made holy by your truth. 20 "I am praying not only for these disciples but also for all who will ever believe in me through their message.  §21 I pray that they will all be one, just as you and I are one-as you are in me, Father, and I am in you. And may they be in us so that the world will believe you sent me. 22 "I have given them the glory you gave me, so they may be one as we are one.  §23 I am in them and you are in me. May they experience such perfect unity that the world will know that you sent me and that you love them as much as you love me.  §24 Father, I want these whom you have given me to be with me where I am. Then they can see all the glory you gave me because you loved me even before the world began! 25 "O righteous Father, the world doesn't know you, but I do; and these disciples know you sent me.  §26 I have revealed you to them, and I will continue to do so. Then your love for me will be in them, and I will be in them."        §§Footnotes:§ 17:6 Greek have revealed your name; also in 17:26.  § 17:11 Some manuscripts read you have given me these [disciples].  § 17:12 Some manuscripts read I protected those you gave me, by the power of your name.  §
NLT/John 18	[Jesus Is Betrayed and Arrested] 1 After saying these things, Jesus crossed the Kidron Valley with his disciples and entered a grove of olive trees. §2 Judas, the betrayer, knew this place, because Jesus had often gone there with his disciples. §3 The leading priests and Pharisees had given Judas a contingent of Roman soldiers and Temple guards to accompany him. Now with blazing torches, lanterns, and weapons, they arrived at the olive grove.§4 Jesus fully realized all that was going to happen to him, so he stepped forward to meet them. "Who are you looking for?"  he asked.§5 "Jesus the Nazarene,"* they replied. " I Am  he,"* Jesus said. (Judas, who betrayed him, was standing with them.) §6 As Jesus said " I Am  he,"  they all drew back and fell to the ground! §7 Once more he asked them, "Who are you looking for?"  And again they replied, "Jesus the Nazarene."§8 "I told you that  I Am  he,"  Jesus said. "And since I am the one you want, let these others go."  §9 He did this to fulfill his own statement: "I did not lose a single one of those you have given me."*Then Simon Peter drew a sword and slashed off the right ear of Malchus, the high priest's slave. §11 But Jesus said to Peter, "Put your sword back into its sheath. Shall I not drink from the cup of suffering the Father has given me?"  §[Jesus at the High Priest's House] 12 So the soldiers, their commanding officer, and the Temple guards arrested Jesus and tied him up. §13 First they took him to Annas, since he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest at that time.* §14 Caiaphas was the one who had told the other Jewish leaders, "It's better that one man should die for the people." §[Peter's First Denial] 15 Simon Peter followed Jesus, as did another of the disciples. That other disciple was acquainted with the high priest, so he was allowed to enter the high priest's courtyard with Jesus. §16 Peter had to stay outside the gate. Then the disciple who knew the high priest spoke to the woman watching at the gate, and she let Peter in. §17 The woman asked Peter, "You're not one of that man's disciples, are you?" "No," he said, "I am not."§18 Because it was cold, the household servants and the guards had made a charcoal fire. They stood around it, warming themselves, and Peter stood with them, warming himself. §[The High Priest Questions Jesus] 19 Inside, the high priest began asking Jesus about his followers and what he had been teaching them. §20 Jesus replied, "Everyone knows what I teach. I have preached regularly in the synagogues and the Temple, where the people* gather. I have not spoken in secret.  §21 Why are you asking me this question? Ask those who heard me. They know what I said." 22 Then one of the Temple guards standing nearby slapped Jesus across the face. "Is that the way to answer the high priest?" he demanded.§23 Jesus replied, "If I said anything wrong, you must prove it. But if I'm speaking the truth, why are you beating me?" 24 Then Annas bound Jesus and sent him to Caiaphas, the high priest. §[Peter's Second and Third Denials] 25 Meanwhile, as Simon Peter was standing by the fire warming himself, they asked him again, "You're not one of his disciples, are you?" He denied it, saying, "No, I am not."§26 But one of the household slaves of the high priest, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, asked, "Didn't I see you out there in the olive grove with Jesus?" §27 Again Peter denied it. And immediately a rooster crowed. §[Jesus' Trial before Pilate] 28 Jesus' trial before Caiaphas ended in the early hours of the morning. Then he was taken to the headquarters of the Roman governor.* His accusers didn't go inside because it would defile them, and they wouldn't be allowed to celebrate the Passover. §29 So Pilate, the governor, went out to them and asked, "What is your charge against this man?"§30 "We wouldn't have handed him over to you if he weren't a criminal!" they retorted.§31 "Then take him away and judge him by your own law," Pilate told them. "Only the Romans are permitted to execute someone," the Jewish leaders replied. §32 (This fulfilled Jesus' prediction about the way he would die.*)§33 Then Pilate went back into his headquarters and called for Jesus to be brought to him. "Are you the king of the Jews?" he asked him.§34 Jesus replied, "Is this your own question, or did others tell you about me?" 35 "Am I a Jew?" Pilate retorted. "Your own people and their leading priests brought you to me for trial. Why? What have you done?"§36 Jesus answered, "My Kingdom is not an earthly kingdom. If it were, my followers would fight to keep me from being handed over to the Jewish leaders. But my Kingdom is not of this world." 37 Pilate said, "So you are a king?" Jesus responded, "You say I am a king. Actually, I was born and came into the world to testify to the truth. All who love the truth recognize that what I say is true." 38 "What is truth?" Pilate asked. Then he went out again to the people and told them, "He is not guilty of any crime. §39 But you have a custom of asking me to release one prisoner each year at Passover. Would you like me to release this "King of the Jews'?"§40 But they shouted back, "No! Not this man. We want Barabbas!" (Barabbas was a revolutionary.)       §§Footnotes:§ 18:5a Or Jesus of Nazareth; also in 18:7.  § 18:5b Or "The " I Am ' is here"; or "I am the Lord "; Greek reads I am; also in 18:6, 8.

NLT/John 19	[Jesus Sentenced to Death] 1 Then Pilate had Jesus flogged with a lead-tipped whip. §2 The soldiers wove a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and they put a purple robe on him. §3 "Hail! King of the Jews!" they mocked, as they slapped him across the face.§4 Pilate went outside again and said to the people, "I am going to bring him out to you now, but understand clearly that I find him not guilty." §5 Then Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. And Pilate said, "Look, here is the man!"§6 When they saw him, the leading priests and Temple guards began shouting, "Crucify him! Crucify him!" "Take him yourselves and crucify him," Pilate said. "I find him not guilty."§7 The Jewish leaders replied, "By our law he ought to die because he called himself the Son of God."§8 When Pilate heard this, he was more frightened than ever. §9 He took Jesus back into the headquarters* again and asked him, "Where are you from?" But Jesus gave no answer. §10 "Why don't you talk to me?" Pilate demanded. "Don't you realize that I have the power to release you or crucify you?"§11 Then Jesus said, "You would have no power over me at all unless it were given to you from above. So the one who handed me over to you has the greater sin." 12 Then Pilate tried to release him, but the Jewish leaders shouted, "If you release this man, you are no "friend of Caesar.'* Anyone who declares himself a king is a rebel against Caesar."§13 When they said this, Pilate brought Jesus out to them again. Then Pilate sat down on the judgment seat on the platform that is called the Stone Pavement (in Hebrew, Gabbatha ). §14 It was now about noon on the day of preparation for the Passover. And Pilate said to the people,* "Look, here is your king!"§15 "Away with him," they yelled. "Away with him! Crucify him!" "What? Crucify your king?" Pilate asked. "We have no king but Caesar," the leading priests shouted back.§16 Then Pilate turned Jesus over to them to be crucified. §[The Crucifixion] So they took Jesus away. §17 Carrying the cross by himself, he went to the place called Place of the Skull (in Hebrew, Golgotha ). §18 There they nailed him to the cross. Two others were crucified with him, one on either side, with Jesus between them. §19 And Pilate posted a sign on the cross that read, "Jesus of Nazareth,* the King of the Jews." §20 The place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and the sign was written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek, so that many people could read it.§21 Then the leading priests objected and said to Pilate, "Change it from "The King of the Jews' to "He said, I am King of the Jews.'"§22 Pilate replied, "No, what I have written, I have written."§23 When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they divided his clothes among the four of them. They also took his robe, but it was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom. §24 So they said, "Rather than tearing it apart, let's throw dice* for it." This fulfilled the Scripture that says, "They divided my garments among themselves and threw dice for my clothing."* So that is what they did.§25 Standing near the cross were Jesus' mother, and his mother's sister, Mary (the wife of Clopas), and Mary Magdalene. §26 When Jesus saw his mother standing there beside the disciple he loved, he said to her, "Dear woman, here is your son."  §27 And he said to this disciple, "Here is your mother."  And from then on this disciple took her into his home. §[The Death of Jesus] 28 Jesus knew that his mission was now finished, and to fulfill Scripture he said, "I am thirsty."* §29 A jar of sour wine was sitting there, so they soaked a sponge in it, put it on a hyssop branch, and held it up to his lips. §30 When Jesus had tasted it, he said, "It is finished!"  Then he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.§31 It was the day of preparation, and the Jewish leaders didn't want the bodies hanging there the next day, which was the Sabbath (and a very special Sabbath, because it was Passover week). So they asked Pilate to hasten their deaths by ordering that their legs be broken. Then their bodies could be taken down. §32 So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the two men crucified with Jesus. §33 But when they came to Jesus, they saw that he was already dead, so they didn't break his legs. §34 One of the soldiers, however, pierced his side with a spear, and immediately blood and water flowed out. §35 (This report is from an eyewitness giving an accurate account. He speaks the truth so that you also may continue to believe.*) §36 These things happened in fulfillment of the Scriptures that say, "Not one of his bones will be broken,"* §37 and "They will look on the one they pierced."*Afterward Joseph of Arimathea, who had been a secret disciple of Jesus (because he feared the Jewish leaders), asked Pilate for permission to take down Jesus' body. When Pilate gave permission, Joseph came and took the body away. §39 With him came Nicodemus, the man who had come to Jesus at night. He brought about seventy-five pounds* of perfumed ointment made from myrrh and aloes. §40 Following Jewish burial custom, they wrapped Jesus' body with the spices in long sheets of linen cloth. §41 The place of crucifixion was near a garden, where there was a new tomb, never used before. §42 And so, because it was the day of preparation for the Jewish Passover* and since the tomb was close at hand, they laid Jesus there.       §§Footnotes:§ 19:9 Greek the Praetorium.  § 19:12 "Friend of Caesar" is a technical term that refers to an ally of the emperor.  § 19:14 Greek Jewish people; also in 19:20.  § 19:19 Or Jesus the Nazarene.  § 19:24a Greek cast lots.  § 19:24b Ps 22:18.  § 19:28 See Pss 22:15; 69:21.  § 19:35 Some manuscripts read that you also may believe.  § 19:36 Exod 12:46; Num 9:12; Ps 34:20.  § 19:37 Zech 12:10.  §[The Burial of Jesus] 38 § 19:39 Greek 100 litras [32.7 kilograms].  § 19:42 Greek because of the Jewish day of preparation.  §
NLT/John 2	[The Wedding at Cana] 1 The next day* there was a wedding celebration in the village of Cana in Galilee. Jesus' mother was there, §2 and Jesus and his disciples were also invited to the celebration. §3 The wine supply ran out during the festivities, so Jesus' mother told him, "They have no more wine."§4 "Dear woman, that's not our problem,"  Jesus replied. "My time has not yet come." 5 But his mother told the servants, "Do whatever he tells you."§6 Standing nearby were six stone water jars, used for Jewish ceremonial washing. Each could hold twenty to thirty gallons.* §7 Jesus told the servants, "Fill the jars with water."  When the jars had been filled, §8 he said, "Now dip some out, and take it to the master of ceremonies."  So the servants followed his instructions.§9 When the master of ceremonies tasted the water that was now wine, not knowing where it had come from (though, of course, the servants knew), he called the bridegroom over. §10 "A host always serves the best wine first," he said. "Then, when everyone has had a lot to drink, he brings out the less expensive wine. But you have kept the best until now!"§11 This miraculous sign at Cana in Galilee was the first time Jesus revealed his glory. And his disciples believed in him.§12 After the wedding he went to Capernaum for a few days with his mother, his brothers, and his disciples. §[Jesus Clears the Temple] 13 It was nearly time for the Jewish Passover celebration, so Jesus went to Jerusalem. §14 In the Temple area he saw merchants selling cattle, sheep, and doves for sacrifices; he also saw dealers at tables exchanging foreign money. §15 Jesus made a whip from some ropes and chased them all out of the Temple. He drove out the sheep and cattle, scattered the money changers' coins over the floor, and turned over their tables. §16 Then, going over to the people who sold doves, he told them, "Get these things out of here. Stop turning my Father's house into a marketplace!" 17 Then his disciples remembered this prophecy from the Scriptures: "Passion for God's house will consume me."*But the Jewish leaders demanded, "What are you doing? If God gave you authority to do this, show us a miraculous sign to prove it."§19 "All right,"  Jesus replied. "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up." 20 "What!" they exclaimed. "It has taken forty-six years to build this Temple, and you can rebuild it in three days?" §21 But when Jesus said "this temple," he meant his own body. §22 After he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered he had said this, and they believed both the Scriptures and what Jesus had said. §[Jesus and Nicodemus] 23 Because of the miraculous signs Jesus did in Jerusalem at the Passover celebration, many began to trust in him. §24 But Jesus didn't trust them, because he knew all about people. §25 No one needed to tell him about human nature, for he knew what was in each person's heart.       §§Footnotes:§ 2:1 Greek On the third day; see 1:35, 43.  § 2:6 Greek 2 or 3 measures [75 to 113 liters].  § 2:17 Or "Concern for God's house will be my undoing."

NLT/John 20	[The Resurrection] 1 Early on Sunday morning,* while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene came to the tomb and found that the stone had been rolled away from the entrance. §2 She ran and found Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one whom Jesus loved. She said, "They have taken the Lord's body out of the tomb, and we don't know where they have put him!"§3 Peter and the other disciple started out for the tomb. §4 They were both running, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first. §5 He stooped and looked in and saw the linen wrappings lying there, but he didn't go in. §6 Then Simon Peter arrived and went inside. He also noticed the linen wrappings lying there, §7 while the cloth that had covered Jesus' head was folded up and lying apart from the other wrappings. §8 Then the disciple who had reached the tomb first also went in, and he saw and believed-§9 for until then they still hadn't understood the Scriptures that said Jesus must rise from the dead. §10 Then they went home. §[Jesus Appears to Mary Magdalene] 11 Mary was standing outside the tomb crying, and as she wept, she stooped and looked in. §12 She saw two white-robed angels, one sitting at the head and the other at the foot of the place where the body of Jesus had been lying. §13 "Dear woman, why are you crying?" the angels asked her. "Because they have taken away my Lord," she replied, "and I don't know where they have put him."§14 She turned to leave and saw someone standing there. It was Jesus, but she didn't recognize him. §15 "Dear woman, why are you crying?"  Jesus asked her. "Who are you looking for?"  She thought he was the gardener. "Sir," she said, "if you have taken him away, tell me where you have put him, and I will go and get him."§16 "Mary!"  Jesus said. She turned to him and cried out, "Rabboni!" (which is Hebrew for "Teacher").§17 "Don't cling to me,"  Jesus said, "for I haven't yet ascended to the Father. But go find my brothers and tell them, "I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.'" 18 Mary Magdalene found the disciples and told them, "I have seen the Lord!" Then she gave them his message. §[Jesus Appears to His Disciples] 19 That Sunday evening* the disciples were meeting behind locked doors because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders. Suddenly, Jesus was standing there among them! "Peace be with you,"  he said. §20 As he spoke, he showed them the wounds in his hands and his side. They were filled with joy when they saw the Lord! §21 Again he said, "Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, so I am sending you."  §22 Then he breathed on them and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit.  §23 If you forgive anyone's sins, they are forgiven. If you do not forgive them, they are not forgiven."  §[Jesus Appears to Thomas] 24 One of the twelve disciples, Thomas (nicknamed the Twin),* was not with the others when Jesus came. §25 They told him, "We have seen the Lord!" But he replied, "I won't believe it unless I see the nail wounds in his hands, put my fingers into them, and place my hand into the wound in his side."§26 Eight days later the disciples were together again, and this time Thomas was with them. The doors were locked; but suddenly, as before, Jesus was standing among them. "Peace be with you,"  he said. §27 Then he said to Thomas, "Put your finger here, and look at my hands. Put your hand into the wound in my side. Don't be faithless any longer. Believe!" 28 "My Lord and my God!" Thomas exclaimed.§29 Then Jesus told him, "You believe because you have seen me. Blessed are those who believe without seeing me."  §[Purpose of the Book] 30 The disciples saw Jesus do many other miraculous signs in addition to the ones recorded in this book. §31 But these are written so that you may continue to believe* that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that by believing in him you will have life by the power of his name.       §§Footnotes:§ 20:1 Greek On the first day of the week.  § 20:19 Greek In the evening of that day, the first day of the week.  § 20:24 Greek Thomas, who was called Didymus.  § 20:31 Some manuscripts read that you may believe.  §
NLT/John 21	[Epilogue: Jesus Appears to Seven Disciples] 1 Later, Jesus appeared again to the disciples beside the Sea of Galilee.* This is how it happened. §2 Several of the disciples were there-Simon Peter, Thomas (nicknamed the Twin),* Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples.§3 Simon Peter said, "I'm going fishing." "We'll come, too," they all said. So they went out in the boat, but they caught nothing all night.§4 At dawn Jesus was standing on the beach, but the disciples couldn't see who he was. §5 He called out, "Fellows,* have you caught any fish?"  "No," they replied.§6 Then he said, "Throw out your net on the right-hand side of the boat, and you'll get some!"  So they did, and they couldn't haul in the net because there were so many fish in it.§7 Then the disciple Jesus loved said to Peter, "It's the Lord!" When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on his tunic (for he had stripped for work), jumped into the water, and headed to shore. §8 The others stayed with the boat and pulled the loaded net to the shore, for they were only about a hundred yards* from shore. §9 When they got there, they found breakfast waiting for them-fish cooking over a charcoal fire, and some bread.§10 "Bring some of the fish you've just caught,"  Jesus said. §11 So Simon Peter went aboard and dragged the net to the shore. There were 153 large fish, and yet the net hadn't torn.§12 "Now come and have some breakfast!"  Jesus said. None of the disciples dared to ask him, "Who are you?" They knew it was the Lord. §13 Then Jesus served them the bread and the fish. §14 This was the third time Jesus had appeared to his disciples since he had been raised from the dead.§15 After breakfast Jesus asked Simon Peter, "Simon son of John, do you love me more than these?*"  "Yes, Lord," Peter replied, "you know I love you." "Then feed my lambs,"  Jesus told him.§16 Jesus repeated the question: "Simon son of John, do you love me?"  "Yes, Lord," Peter said, "you know I love you." "Then take care of my sheep,"  Jesus said.§17 A third time he asked him, "Simon son of John, do you love me?"  Peter was hurt that Jesus asked the question a third time. He said, "Lord, you know everything. You know that I love you." Jesus said, "Then feed my sheep. 18 "I tell you the truth, when you were young, you were able to do as you liked; you dressed yourself and went wherever you wanted to go. But when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and others* will dress you and take you where you don't want to go."  §19 Jesus said this to let him know by what kind of death he would glorify God. Then Jesus told him, "Follow me." 20 Peter turned around and saw behind them the disciple Jesus loved-the one who had leaned over to Jesus during supper and asked, "Lord, who will betray you?" §21 Peter asked Jesus, "What about him, Lord?"§22 Jesus replied, "If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you? As for you, follow me."  §23 So the rumor spread among the community of believers* that this disciple wouldn't die. But that isn't what Jesus said at all. He only said, "If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you?" 24 This disciple is the one who testifies to these events and has recorded them here. And we know that his account of these things is accurate.§25 Jesus also did many other things. If they were all written down, I suppose the whole world could not contain the books that would be written.       §§Footnotes:§ 21:1 Greek Sea of Tiberias, another name for the Sea of Galilee.  § 21:2 Greek Thomas, who was called Didymus.  § 21:5 Greek Children.  § 21:8 Greek 200 cubits [90 meters].  § 21:15 Or more than these others do?  § 21:18 Some manuscripts read and another one.  § 21:23 Greek the brothers.  §
NLT/John 3	1 There was a man named Nicodemus, a Jewish religious leader who was a Pharisee. §2 After dark one evening, he came to speak with Jesus. "Rabbi," he said, "we all know that God has sent you to teach us. Your miraculous signs are evidence that God is with you."§3 Jesus replied, "I tell you the truth, unless you are born again,* you cannot see the Kingdom of God." 4 "What do you mean?" exclaimed Nicodemus. "How can an old man go back into his mother's womb and be born again?"§5 Jesus replied, "I assure you, no one can enter the Kingdom of God without being born of water and the Spirit.* §6 Humans can reproduce only human life, but the Holy Spirit gives birth to spiritual life.* §7 So don't be surprised when I say, "You* must be born again.'  §8 The wind blows wherever it wants. Just as you can hear the wind but can't tell where it comes from or where it is going, so you can't explain how people are born of the Spirit." 9 "How are these things possible?" Nicodemus asked.§10 Jesus replied, "You are a respected Jewish teacher, and yet you don't understand these things?  §11 I assure you, we tell you what we know and have seen, and yet you won't believe our testimony.  §12 But if you don't believe me when I tell you about earthly things, how can you possibly believe if I tell you about heavenly things?  §13 No one has ever gone to heaven and returned. But the Son of Man* has come down from heaven.  §14 And as Moses lifted up the bronze snake on a pole in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up,  §15 so that everyone who believes in him will have eternal life.*"For this is how God loved the world: He gave* his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life.  §17 God sent his Son into the world not to judge the world, but to save the world through him. 18 "There is no judgment against anyone who believes in him. But anyone who does not believe in him has already been judged for not believing in God's one and only Son.  §19 And the judgment is based on this fact: God's light came into the world, but people loved the darkness more than the light, for their actions were evil.  §20 All who do evil hate the light and refuse to go near it for fear their sins will be exposed.  §21 But those who do what is right come to the light so others can see that they are doing what God wants.*"  §[John the Baptist Exalts Jesus] 22 Then Jesus and his disciples left Jerusalem and went into the Judean countryside. Jesus spent some time with them there, baptizing people.§23 At this time John the Baptist was baptizing at Aenon, near Salim, because there was plenty of water there; and people kept coming to him for baptism. §24 (This was before John was thrown into prison.) §25 A debate broke out between John's disciples and a certain Jew* over ceremonial cleansing. §26 So John's disciples came to him and said, "Rabbi, the man you met on the other side of the Jordan River, the one you identified as the Messiah, is also baptizing people. And everybody is going to him instead of coming to us."§27 John replied, "No one can receive anything unless God gives it from heaven. §28 You yourselves know how plainly I told you, "I am not the Messiah. I am only here to prepare the way for him.' §29 It is the bridegroom who marries the bride, and the bridegroom's friend is simply glad to stand with him and hear his vows. Therefore, I am filled with joy at his success. §30 He must become greater and greater, and I must become less and less.§31 "He has come from above and is greater than anyone else. We are of the earth, and we speak of earthly things, but he has come from heaven and is greater than anyone else.* §32 He testifies about what he has seen and heard, but how few believe what he tells them! §33 Anyone who accepts his testimony can affirm that God is true. §34 For he is sent by God. He speaks God's words, for God gives him the Spirit without limit. §35 The Father loves his Son and has put everything into his hands. §36 And anyone who believes in God's Son has eternal life. Anyone who doesn't obey the Son will never experience eternal life but remains under God's angry judgment."       §§Footnotes:§ 3:3 Or born from above; also in 3:7.  § 3:5 Or and spirit.

NLT/John 4	[Jesus and the Samaritan Woman] 1 Jesus* knew the Pharisees had heard that he was baptizing and making more disciples than John §2 (though Jesus himself didn't baptize them-his disciples did). §3 So he left Judea and returned to Galilee.§4 He had to go through Samaria on the way. §5 Eventually he came to the Samaritan village of Sychar, near the field that Jacob gave to his son Joseph. §6 Jacob's well was there; and Jesus, tired from the long walk, sat wearily beside the well about noontime. §7 Soon a Samaritan woman came to draw water, and Jesus said to her, "Please give me a drink."  §8 He was alone at the time because his disciples had gone into the village to buy some food.§9 The woman was surprised, for Jews refuse to have anything to do with Samaritans.* She said to Jesus, "You are a Jew, and I am a Samaritan woman. Why are you asking me for a drink?"§10 Jesus replied, "If you only knew the gift God has for you and who you are speaking to, you would ask me, and I would give you living water." 11 "But sir, you don't have a rope or a bucket," she said, "and this well is very deep. Where would you get this living water? §12 And besides, do you think you're greater than our ancestor Jacob, who gave us this well? How can you offer better water than he and his sons and his animals enjoyed?"§13 Jesus replied, "Anyone who drinks this water will soon become thirsty again.  §14 But those who drink the water I give will never be thirsty again. It becomes a fresh, bubbling spring within them, giving them eternal life." 15 "Please, sir," the woman said, "give me this water! Then I'll never be thirsty again, and I won't have to come here to get water."§16 "Go and get your husband,"  Jesus told her.§17 "I don't have a husband," the woman replied. Jesus said, "You're right! You don't have a husband- 18 for you have had five husbands, and you aren't even married to the man you're living with now. You certainly spoke the truth!" 19 "Sir," the woman said, "you must be a prophet. §20 So tell me, why is it that you Jews insist that Jerusalem is the only place of worship, while we Samaritans claim it is here at Mount Gerizim,* where our ancestors worshiped?"§21 Jesus replied, "Believe me, dear woman, the time is coming when it will no longer matter whether you worship the Father on this mountain or in Jerusalem.  §22 You Samaritans know very little about the one you worship, while we Jews know all about him, for salvation comes through the Jews.  §23 But the time is coming-indeed it's here now-when true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth. The Father is looking for those who will worship him that way.  §24 For God is Spirit, so those who worship him must worship in spirit and in truth." 25 The woman said, "I know the Messiah is coming-the one who is called Christ. When he comes, he will explain everything to us."§26 Then Jesus told her, " I Am  the Messiah!"*Just then his disciples came back. They were shocked to find him talking to a woman, but none of them had the nerve to ask, "What do you want with her?" or "Why are you talking to her?" §28 The woman left her water jar beside the well and ran back to the village, telling everyone, §29 "Come and see a man who told me everything I ever did! Could he possibly be the Messiah?" §30 So the people came streaming from the village to see him.§31 Meanwhile, the disciples were urging Jesus, "Rabbi, eat something."§32 But Jesus replied, "I have a kind of food you know nothing about." 33 "Did someone bring him food while we were gone?" the disciples asked each other.§34 Then Jesus explained: "My nourishment comes from doing the will of God, who sent me, and from finishing his work.  §35 You know the saying, "Four months between planting and harvest.' But I say, wake up and look around. The fields are already ripe* for harvest.  §36 The harvesters are paid good wages, and the fruit they harvest is people brought to eternal life. What joy awaits both the planter and the harvester alike!  §37 You know the saying, "One plants and another harvests.' And it's true.  §38 I sent you to harvest where you didn't plant; others had already done the work, and now you will get to gather the harvest."  §[Many Samaritans Believe] 39 Many Samaritans from the village believed in Jesus because the woman had said, "He told me everything I ever did!" §40 When they came out to see him, they begged him to stay in their village. So he stayed for two days, §41 long enough for many more to hear his message and believe. §42 Then they said to the woman, "Now we believe, not just because of what you told us, but because we have heard him ourselves. Now we know that he is indeed the Savior of the world." §[Jesus Heals an Official's Son] 43 At the end of the two days, Jesus went on to Galilee. §44 He himself had said that a prophet is not honored in his own hometown. §45 Yet the Galileans welcomed him, for they had been in Jerusalem at the Passover celebration and had seen everything he did there.§46 As he traveled through Galilee, he came to Cana, where he had turned the water into wine. There was a government official in nearby Capernaum whose son was very sick. §47 When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee, he went and begged Jesus to come to Capernaum to heal his son, who was about to die.§48 Jesus asked, "Will you never believe in me unless you see miraculous signs and wonders?" 49 The official pleaded, "Lord, please come now before my little boy dies."§50 Then Jesus told him, "Go back home. Your son will live!"  And the man believed what Jesus said and started home.§51 While the man was on his way, some of his servants met him with the news that his son was alive and well. §52 He asked them when the boy had begun to get better, and they replied, "Yesterday afternoon at one o'clock his fever suddenly disappeared!" §53 Then the father realized that that was the very time Jesus had told him, "Your son will live."  And he and his entire household believed in Jesus. §54 This was the second miraculous sign Jesus did in Galilee after coming from Judea.       §§Footnotes:§ 4:1 Some manuscripts read The Lord.  § 4:9 Some manuscripts do not include this sentence.  § 4:20 Greek on this mountain.  § 4:26 Or "The " I Am ' is here"; or "I am the Lord "; Greek reads "I am, the one speaking to you."

NLT/John 5	[Jesus Heals a Lame Man] 1 Afterward Jesus returned to Jerusalem for one of the Jewish holy days. §2 Inside the city, near the Sheep Gate, was the pool of Bethesda,* with five covered porches. §3 Crowds of sick people-blind, lame, or paralyzed-lay on the porches.* §5 One of the men lying there had been sick for thirty-eight years. §6 When Jesus saw him and knew he had been ill for a long time, he asked him, "Would you like to get well?" 7 "I can't, sir," the sick man said, "for I have no one to put me into the pool when the water bubbles up. Someone else always gets there ahead of me."§8 Jesus told him, "Stand up, pick up your mat, and walk!" 9 Instantly, the man was healed! He rolled up his sleeping mat and began walking! But this miracle happened on the Sabbath, §10 so the Jewish leaders objected. They said to the man who was cured, "You can't work on the Sabbath! The law doesn't allow you to carry that sleeping mat!"§11 But he replied, "The man who healed me told me, "Pick up your mat and walk.'"§12 "Who said such a thing as that?" they demanded.§13 The man didn't know, for Jesus had disappeared into the crowd. §14 But afterward Jesus found him in the Temple and told him, "Now you are well; so stop sinning, or something even worse may happen to you."  §15 Then the man went and told the Jewish leaders that it was Jesus who had healed him. §[Jesus Claims to Be the Son of God] 16 So the Jewish leaders began harassing* Jesus for breaking the Sabbath rules. §17 But Jesus replied, "My Father is always working, and so am I."  §18 So the Jewish leaders tried all the harder to find a way to kill him. For he not only broke the Sabbath, he called God his Father, thereby making himself equal with God.§19 So Jesus explained, "I tell you the truth, the Son can do nothing by himself. He does only what he sees the Father doing. Whatever the Father does, the Son also does.  §20 For the Father loves the Son and shows him everything he is doing. In fact, the Father will show him how to do even greater works than healing this man. Then you will truly be astonished.  §21 For just as the Father gives life to those he raises from the dead, so the Son gives life to anyone he wants.  §22 In addition, the Father judges no one. Instead, he has given the Son absolute authority to judge,  §23 so that everyone will honor the Son, just as they honor the Father. Anyone who does not honor the Son is certainly not honoring the Father who sent him. 24 "I tell you the truth, those who listen to my message and believe in God who sent me have eternal life. They will never be condemned for their sins, but they have already passed from death into life. 25 "And I assure you that the time is coming, indeed it's here now, when the dead will hear my voice-the voice of the Son of God. And those who listen will live.  §26 The Father has life in himself, and he has granted that same life-giving power to his Son.  §27 And he has given him authority to judge everyone because he is the Son of Man.* §28 Don't be so surprised! Indeed, the time is coming when all the dead in their graves will hear the voice of God's Son,  §29 and they will rise again. Those who have done good will rise to experience eternal life, and those who have continued in evil will rise to experience judgment.  §30 I can do nothing on my own. I judge as God tells me. Therefore, my judgment is just, because I carry out the will of the one who sent me, not my own will.  §[Witnesses to Jesus] 31 "If I were to testify on my own behalf, my testimony would not be valid.  §32 But someone else is also testifying about me, and I assure you that everything he says about me is true.  §33 In fact, you sent investigators to listen to John the Baptist, and his testimony about me was true.  §34 Of course, I have no need of human witnesses, but I say these things so you might be saved.  §35 John was like a burning and shining lamp, and you were excited for a while about his message.  §36 But I have a greater witness than John-my teachings and my miracles. The Father gave me these works to accomplish, and they prove that he sent me.  §37 And the Father who sent me has testified about me himself. You have never heard his voice or seen him face to face,  §38 and you do not have his message in your hearts, because you do not believe me-the one he sent to you. 39 "You search the Scriptures because you think they give you eternal life. But the Scriptures point to me!  §40 Yet you refuse to come to me to receive this life. 41 "Your approval means nothing to me,  §42 because I know you don't have God's love within you.  §43 For I have come to you in my Father's name, and you have rejected me. Yet if others come in their own name, you gladly welcome them.  §44 No wonder you can't believe! For you gladly honor each other, but you don't care about the honor that comes from the one who alone is God.*"Yet it isn't I who will accuse you before the Father. Moses will accuse you!

NLT/John 6	[Jesus Feeds Five Thousand] 1 After this, Jesus crossed over to the far side of the Sea of Galilee, also known as the Sea of Tiberias. §2 A huge crowd kept following him wherever he went, because they saw his miraculous signs as he healed the sick. §3 Then Jesus climbed a hill and sat down with his disciples around him. §4 (It was nearly time for the Jewish Passover celebration.) §5 Jesus soon saw a huge crowd of people coming to look for him. Turning to Philip, he asked, "Where can we buy bread to feed all these people?"  §6 He was testing Philip, for he already knew what he was going to do.§7 Philip replied, "Even if we worked for months, we wouldn't have enough money* to feed them!"§8 Then Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, spoke up. §9 "There's a young boy here with five barley loaves and two fish. But what good is that with this huge crowd?"§10 "Tell everyone to sit down,"  Jesus said. So they all sat down on the grassy slopes. (The men alone numbered about 5,000.) §11 Then Jesus took the loaves, gave thanks to God, and distributed them to the people. Afterward he did the same with the fish. And they all ate as much as they wanted. §12 After everyone was full, Jesus told his disciples, "Now gather the leftovers, so that nothing is wasted."  §13 So they picked up the pieces and filled twelve baskets with scraps left by the people who had eaten from the five barley loaves.§14 When the people saw him* do this miraculous sign, they exclaimed, "Surely, he is the Prophet we have been expecting!"* §15 When Jesus saw that they were ready to force him to be their king, he slipped away into the hills by himself. §[Jesus Walks on Water] 16 That evening Jesus' disciples went down to the shore to wait for him. §17 But as darkness fell and Jesus still hadn't come back, they got into the boat and headed across the lake toward Capernaum. §18 Soon a gale swept down upon them, and the sea grew very rough. §19 They had rowed three or four miles* when suddenly they saw Jesus walking on the water toward the boat. They were terrified, §20 but he called out to them, "Don't be afraid. I am here!*"  §21 Then they were eager to let him in the boat, and immediately they arrived at their destination! §[Jesus, the Bread of Life] 22 The next day the crowd that had stayed on the far shore saw that the disciples had taken the only boat, and they realized Jesus had not gone with them. §23 Several boats from Tiberias landed near the place where the Lord had blessed the bread and the people had eaten. §24 So when the crowd saw that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they got into the boats and went across to Capernaum to look for him. §25 They found him on the other side of the lake and asked, "Rabbi, when did you get here?"§26 Jesus replied, "I tell you the truth, you want to be with me because I fed you, not because you understood the miraculous signs.  §27 But don't be so concerned about perishable things like food. Spend your energy seeking the eternal life that the Son of Man* can give you. For God the Father has given me the seal of his approval." 28 They replied, "We want to perform God's works, too. What should we do?"§29 Jesus told them, "This is the only work God wants from you: Believe in the one he has sent." 30 They answered, "Show us a miraculous sign if you want us to believe in you. What can you do? §31 After all, our ancestors ate manna while they journeyed through the wilderness! The Scriptures say, "Moses gave them bread from heaven to eat.'*"§32 Jesus said, "I tell you the truth, Moses didn't give you bread from heaven. My Father did. And now he offers you the true bread from heaven.  §33 The true bread of God is the one who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world." 34 "Sir," they said, "give us that bread every day."§35 Jesus replied, "I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never be hungry again. Whoever believes in me will never be thirsty.  §36 But you haven't believed in me even though you have seen me.  §37 However, those the Father has given me will come to me, and I will never reject them.  §38 For I have come down from heaven to do the will of God who sent me, not to do my own will.  §39 And this is the will of God, that I should not lose even one of all those he has given me, but that I should raise them up at the last day.  §40 For it is my Father's will that all who see his Son and believe in him should have eternal life. I will raise them up at the last day." 41 Then the people* began to murmur in disagreement because he had said, "I am the bread that came down from heaven."  §42 They said, "Isn't this Jesus, the son of Joseph? We know his father and mother. How can he say, "I came down from heaven'?"§43 But Jesus replied, "Stop complaining about what I said.  §44 For no one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws them to me, and at the last day I will raise them up.  §45 As it is written in the Scriptures,* "They will all be taught by God.' Everyone who listens to the Father and learns from him comes to me.  §46 (Not that anyone has ever seen the Father; only I, who was sent from God, have seen him.) 47 "I tell you the truth, anyone who believes has eternal life.  §48 Yes, I am the bread of life!  §49 Your ancestors ate manna in the wilderness, but they all died.  §50 Anyone who eats the bread from heaven, however, will never die.  §51 I am the living bread that came down from heaven. Anyone who eats this bread will live forever; and this bread, which I will offer so the world may live, is my flesh." 52 Then the people began arguing with each other about what he meant. "How can this man give us his flesh to eat?" they asked.§53 So Jesus said again, "I tell you the truth, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you cannot have eternal life within you.  §54 But anyone who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise that person at the last day.  §55 For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink.  §56 Anyone who eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in him.  §57 I live because of the living Father who sent me; in the same way, anyone who feeds on me will live because of me.  §58 I am the true bread that came down from heaven. Anyone who eats this bread will not die as your ancestors did (even though they ate the manna) but will live forever." 59 He said these things while he was teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum. §[Many Disciples Desert Jesus] 60 Many of his disciples said, "This is very hard to understand. How can anyone accept it?"§61 Jesus was aware that his disciples were complaining, so he said to them, "Does this offend you?  §62 Then what will you think if you see the Son of Man ascend to heaven again?  §63 The Spirit alone gives eternal life. Human effort accomplishes nothing. And the very words I have spoken to you are spirit and life.  §64 But some of you do not believe me."  (For Jesus knew from the beginning which ones didn't believe, and he knew who would betray him.) §65 Then he said, "That is why I said that people can't come to me unless the Father gives them to me." 66 At this point many of his disciples turned away and deserted him. §67 Then Jesus turned to the Twelve and asked, "Are you also going to leave?" 68 Simon Peter replied, "Lord, to whom would we go? You have the words that give eternal life. §69 We believe, and we know you are the Holy One of God.*"§70 Then Jesus said, "I chose the twelve of you, but one is a devil."  §71 He was speaking of Judas, son of Simon Iscariot, one of the Twelve, who would later betray him.       §§Footnotes:§ 6:7 Greek Two hundred denarii would not be enough.

NLT/John 7	[Jesus and His Brothers] 1 After this, Jesus traveled around Galilee. He wanted to stay out of Judea, where the Jewish leaders were plotting his death. §2 But soon it was time for the Jewish Festival of Shelters, §3 and Jesus' brothers said to him, "Leave here and go to Judea, where your followers can see your miracles! §4 You can't become famous if you hide like this! If you can do such wonderful things, show yourself to the world!" §5 For even his brothers didn't believe in him.§6 Jesus replied, "Now is not the right time for me to go, but you can go anytime.  §7 The world can't hate you, but it does hate me because I accuse it of doing evil.  §8 You go on. I'm not going* to this festival, because my time has not yet come."  §9 After saying these things, Jesus remained in Galilee. §[Jesus Teaches Openly at the Temple] 10 But after his brothers left for the festival, Jesus also went, though secretly, staying out of public view. §11 The Jewish leaders tried to find him at the festival and kept asking if anyone had seen him. §12 There was a lot of grumbling about him among the crowds. Some argued, "He's a good man," but others said, "He's nothing but a fraud who deceives the people." §13 But no one had the courage to speak favorably about him in public, for they were afraid of getting in trouble with the Jewish leaders.§14 Then, midway through the festival, Jesus went up to the Temple and began to teach. §15 The people* were surprised when they heard him. "How does he know so much when he hasn't been trained?" they asked.§16 So Jesus told them, "My message is not my own; it comes from God who sent me.  §17 Anyone who wants to do the will of God will know whether my teaching is from God or is merely my own.  §18 Those who speak for themselves want glory only for themselves, but a person who seeks to honor the one who sent him speaks truth, not lies.  §19 Moses gave you the law, but none of you obeys it! In fact, you are trying to kill me." 20 The crowd replied, "You're demon possessed! Who's trying to kill you?"§21 Jesus replied, "I did one miracle on the Sabbath, and you were amazed.  §22 But you work on the Sabbath, too, when you obey Moses' law of circumcision. (Actually, this tradition of circumcision began with the patriarchs, long before the law of Moses.)  §23 For if the correct time for circumcising your son falls on the Sabbath, you go ahead and do it so as not to break the law of Moses. So why should you be angry with me for healing a man on the Sabbath?  §24 Look beneath the surface so you can judge correctly."  §[Is Jesus the Messiah?] 25 Some of the people who lived in Jerusalem started to ask each other, "Isn't this the man they are trying to kill? §26 But here he is, speaking in public, and they say nothing to him. Could our leaders possibly believe that he is the Messiah? §27 But how could he be? For we know where this man comes from. When the Messiah comes, he will simply appear; no one will know where he comes from."§28 While Jesus was teaching in the Temple, he called out, "Yes, you know me, and you know where I come from. But I'm not here on my own. The one who sent me is true, and you don't know him.  §29 But I know him because I come from him, and he sent me to you."  §30 Then the leaders tried to arrest him; but no one laid a hand on him, because his time* had not yet come.§31 Many among the crowds at the Temple believed in him. "After all," they said, "would you expect the Messiah to do more miraculous signs than this man has done?"§32 When the Pharisees heard that the crowds were whispering such things, they and the leading priests sent Temple guards to arrest Jesus. §33 But Jesus told them, "I will be with you only a little longer. Then I will return to the one who sent me.  §34 You will search for me but not find me. And you cannot go where I am going." 35 The Jewish leaders were puzzled by this statement. "Where is he planning to go?" they asked. "Is he thinking of leaving the country and going to the Jews in other lands?* Maybe he will even teach the Greeks! §36 What does he mean when he says, "You will search for me but not find me,' and "You cannot go where I am going'?" §[Jesus Promises Living Water] 37 On the last day, the climax of the festival, Jesus stood and shouted to the crowds, "Anyone who is thirsty may come to me!  §38 Anyone who believes in me may come and drink! For the Scriptures declare, "Rivers of living water will flow from his heart.'"* §39 (When he said "living water," he was speaking of the Spirit, who would be given to everyone believing in him. But the Spirit had not yet been given,* because Jesus had not yet entered into his glory.) §[Division and Unbelief] 40 When the crowds heard him say this, some of them declared, "Surely this man is the Prophet we've been expecting."* §41 Others said, "He is the Messiah." Still others said, "But he can't be! Will the Messiah come from Galilee? §42 For the Scriptures clearly state that the Messiah will be born of the royal line of David, in Bethlehem, the village where King David was born."* §43 So the crowd was divided about him. §44 Some even wanted him arrested, but no one laid a hand on him.§45 When the Temple guards returned without having arrested Jesus, the leading priests and Pharisees demanded, "Why didn't you bring him in?"§46 "We have never heard anyone speak like this!" the guards responded.§47 "Have you been led astray, too?" the Pharisees mocked. §48 "Is there a single one of us rulers or Pharisees who believes in him? §49 This foolish crowd follows him, but they are ignorant of the law. God's curse is on them!"§50 Then Nicodemus, the leader who had met with Jesus earlier, spoke up. §51 "Is it legal to convict a man before he is given a hearing?" he asked.§52 They replied, "Are you from Galilee, too? Search the Scriptures and see for yourself-no prophet ever comes* from Galilee!" ---------- [ The most ancient Greek manuscripts do not include John 7:53&#8211;8:11. ]§53 Then the meeting broke up, and everybody went home.       §§Footnotes:§ 7:8 Some manuscripts read not yet going.  § 7:15 Greek Jewish people.  § 7:30 Greek his hour.  § 7:35 Or the Jews who live among the Greeks?  § 7:37-38 Or "Let anyone who is thirsty come to me and drink.  38 For the Scriptures declare, "Rivers of living water will flow from the heart of anyone who believes in me.'"  § 7:39 Several early manuscripts read But as yet there was no Spirit.

NLT/John 8	[A Woman Caught in Adultery] 1 Jesus returned to the Mount of Olives, §2 but early the next morning he was back again at the Temple. A crowd soon gathered, and he sat down and taught them. §3 As he was speaking, the teachers of religious law and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in the act of adultery. They put her in front of the crowd.§4 "Teacher," they said to Jesus, "this woman was caught in the act of adultery. §5 The law of Moses says to stone her. What do you say?"§6 They were trying to trap him into saying something they could use against him, but Jesus stooped down and wrote in the dust with his finger. §7 They kept demanding an answer, so he stood up again and said, "All right, but let the one who has never sinned throw the first stone!"  §8 Then he stooped down again and wrote in the dust.§9 When the accusers heard this, they slipped away one by one, beginning with the oldest, until only Jesus was left in the middle of the crowd with the woman. §10 Then Jesus stood up again and said to the woman, "Where are your accusers? Didn't even one of them condemn you?" 11 "No, Lord," she said. And Jesus said, "Neither do I. Go and sin no more."  ---------- §[Jesus, the Light of the World] 12 Jesus spoke to the people once more and said, "I am the light of the world. If you follow me, you won't have to walk in darkness, because you will have the light that leads to life." 13 The Pharisees replied, "You are making those claims about yourself! Such testimony is not valid."§14 Jesus told them, "These claims are valid even though I make them about myself. For I know where I came from and where I am going, but you don't know this about me.  §15 You judge me by human standards, but I do not judge anyone.  §16 And if I did, my judgment would be correct in every respect because I am not alone. The Father* who sent me is with me.  §17 Your own law says that if two people agree about something, their witness is accepted as fact.* §18 I am one witness, and my Father who sent me is the other." 19 "Where is your father?" they asked. Jesus answered, "Since you don't know who I am, you don't know who my Father is. If you knew me, you would also know my Father."  §20 Jesus made these statements while he was teaching in the section of the Temple known as the Treasury. But he was not arrested, because his time* had not yet come. §[The Unbelieving People Warned] 21 Later Jesus said to them again, "I am going away. You will search for me but will die in your sin. You cannot come where I am going." 22 The people* asked, "Is he planning to commit suicide? What does he mean, "You cannot come where I am going'?"§23 Jesus continued, "You are from below; I am from above. You belong to this world; I do not.  §24 That is why I said that you will die in your sins; for unless you believe that  I Am  who I claim to be,* you will die in your sins." 25 "Who are you?" they demanded. Jesus replied, "The one I have always claimed to be.* §26 I have much to say about you and much to condemn, but I won't. For I say only what I have heard from the one who sent me, and he is completely truthful."  §27 But they still didn't understand that he was talking about his Father.§28 So Jesus said, "When you have lifted up the Son of Man on the cross, then you will understand that  I Am  he.* I do nothing on my own but say only what the Father taught me.  §29 And the one who sent me is with me-he has not deserted me. For I always do what pleases him."  §30 Then many who heard him say these things believed in him. §[Jesus and Abraham] 31 Jesus said to the people who believed in him, "You are truly my disciples if you remain faithful to my teachings.  §32 And you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free." 33 "But we are descendants of Abraham," they said. "We have never been slaves to anyone. What do you mean, "You will be set free'?"§34 Jesus replied, "I tell you the truth, everyone who sins is a slave of sin.  §35 A slave is not a permanent member of the family, but a son is part of the family forever.  §36 So if the Son sets you free, you are truly free.  §37 Yes, I realize that you are descendants of Abraham. And yet some of you are trying to kill me because there's no room in your hearts for my message.  §38 I am telling you what I saw when I was with my Father. But you are following the advice of your father." 39 "Our father is Abraham!" they declared. "No,"  Jesus replied, "for if you were really the children of Abraham, you would follow his example.* §40 Instead, you are trying to kill me because I told you the truth, which I heard from God. Abraham never did such a thing.  §41 No, you are imitating your real father."  They replied, "We aren't illegitimate children! God himself is our true Father."§42 Jesus told them, "If God were your Father, you would love me, because I have come to you from God. I am not here on my own, but he sent me.  §43 Why can't you understand what I am saying? It's because you can't even hear me!  §44 For you are the children of your father the devil, and you love to do the evil things he does. He was a murderer from the beginning. He has always hated the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, it is consistent with his character; for he is a liar and the father of lies.  §45 So when I tell the truth, you just naturally don't believe me!  §46 Which of you can truthfully accuse me of sin? And since I am telling you the truth, why don't you believe me?  §47 Anyone who belongs to God listens gladly to the words of God. But you don't listen because you don't belong to God." 48 The people retorted, "You Samaritan devil! Didn't we say all along that you were possessed by a demon?"§49 "No,"  Jesus said, "I have no demon in me. For I honor my Father-and you dishonor me.  §50 And though I have no wish to glorify myself, God is going to glorify me. He is the true judge.  §51 I tell you the truth, anyone who obeys my teaching will never die!" 52 The people said, "Now we know you are possessed by a demon. Even Abraham and the prophets died, but you say, "Anyone who obeys my teaching will never die!' §53 Are you greater than our father Abraham? He died, and so did the prophets. Who do you think you are?"§54 Jesus answered, "If I want glory for myself, it doesn't count. But it is my Father who will glorify me. You say, "He is our God,'* §55 but you don't even know him. I know him. If I said otherwise, I would be as great a liar as you! But I do know him and obey him.  §56 Your father Abraham rejoiced as he looked forward to my coming. He saw it and was glad." 57 The people said, "You aren't even fifty years old. How can you say you have seen Abraham?*"§58 Jesus answered, "I tell you the truth, before Abraham was even born,  I Am  !*"  §59 At that point they picked up stones to throw at him. But Jesus was hidden from them and left the Temple.       §§Footnotes:§ 8:16 Some manuscripts read The One.  § 8:17 See Deut 19:15.  § 8:20 Greek his hour.  § 8:22 Greek Jewish people; also in 8:31, 48, 52, 57.  § 8:24 Greek unless you believe that I am.

NLT/John 9	[Jesus Heals a Man Born Blind] 1 As Jesus was walking along, he saw a man who had been blind from birth. §2 "Rabbi," his disciples asked him, "why was this man born blind? Was it because of his own sins or his parents' sins?"§3 "It was not because of his sins or his parents' sins,"  Jesus answered. "This happened so the power of God could be seen in him.  §4 We must quickly carry out the tasks assigned us by the one who sent us.* The night is coming, and then no one can work.  §5 But while I am here in the world, I am the light of the world." 6 Then he spit on the ground, made mud with the saliva, and spread the mud over the blind man's eyes. §7 He told him, "Go wash yourself in the pool of Siloam"  (Siloam means "sent"). So the man went and washed and came back seeing!§8 His neighbors and others who knew him as a blind beggar asked each other, "Isn't this the man who used to sit and beg?" §9 Some said he was, and others said, "No, he just looks like him!" But the beggar kept saying, "Yes, I am the same one!"§10 They asked, "Who healed you? What happened?"§11 He told them, "The man they call Jesus made mud and spread it over my eyes and told me, "Go to the pool of Siloam and wash yourself.' So I went and washed, and now I can see!"§12 "Where is he now?" they asked. "I don't know," he replied.§13 Then they took the man who had been blind to the Pharisees, §14 because it was on the Sabbath that Jesus had made the mud and healed him. §15 The Pharisees asked the man all about it. So he told them, "He put the mud over my eyes, and when I washed it away, I could see!"§16 Some of the Pharisees said, "This man Jesus is not from God, for he is working on the Sabbath." Others said, "But how could an ordinary sinner do such miraculous signs?" So there was a deep division of opinion among them.§17 Then the Pharisees again questioned the man who had been blind and demanded, "What's your opinion about this man who healed you?" The man replied, "I think he must be a prophet."§18 The Jewish leaders still refused to believe the man had been blind and could now see, so they called in his parents. §19 They asked them, "Is this your son? Was he born blind? If so, how can he now see?"§20 His parents replied, "We know this is our son and that he was born blind, §21 but we don't know how he can see or who healed him. Ask him. He is old enough to speak for himself." §22 His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders, who had announced that anyone saying Jesus was the Messiah would be expelled from the synagogue. §23 That's why they said, "He is old enough. Ask him."§24 So for the second time they called in the man who had been blind and told him, "God should get the glory for this,* because we know this man Jesus is a sinner."§25 "I don't know whether he is a sinner," the man replied. "But I know this: I was blind, and now I can see!"§26 "But what did he do?" they asked. "How did he heal you?"§27 "Look!" the man exclaimed. "I told you once. Didn't you listen? Why do you want to hear it again? Do you want to become his disciples, too?"§28 Then they cursed him and said, "You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses! §29 We know God spoke to Moses, but we don't even know where this man comes from."§30 "Why, that's very strange!" the man replied. "He healed my eyes, and yet you don't know where he comes from? §31 We know that God doesn't listen to sinners, but he is ready to hear those who worship him and do his will. §32 Ever since the world began, no one has been able to open the eyes of someone born blind. §33 If this man were not from God, he couldn't have done it."§34 "You were born a total sinner!" they answered. "Are you trying to teach us?" And they threw him out of the synagogue. §[Spiritual Blindness] 35 When Jesus heard what had happened, he found the man and asked, "Do you believe in the Son of Man?*" 36 The man answered, "Who is he, sir? I want to believe in him."§37 "You have seen him,"  Jesus said, "and he is speaking to you!" 38 "Yes, Lord, I believe!" the man said. And he worshiped Jesus.§39 Then Jesus told him,*  "I entered this world to render judgment-to give sight to the blind and to show those who think they see* that they are blind." 40 Some Pharisees who were standing nearby heard him and asked, "Are you saying we're blind?"§41 "If you were blind, you wouldn't be guilty,"  Jesus replied. "But you remain guilty because you claim you can see.        §§Footnotes:§ 9:4 Other manuscripts read I must quickly carry out the tasks assigned me by the one who sent me; still others read We must quickly carry out the tasks assigned us by the one who sent me.  § 9:24 Or Give glory to God, not to Jesus; Greek reads Give glory to God.  § 9:35 Some manuscripts read the Son of God?
