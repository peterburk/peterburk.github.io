<div2 type="chapter" n="29" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 29.—THE PARTHIAN EMPIRE.</head><p>The kingdoms<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> of Parthia are eighteen in all: such beingthe divisions of its provinces, which lie, as we have alreadystated, along the Red Sea to the south, and the Hyrcanian tothe north. Of this number the eleven, called the Higher provinces, begin at the frontiers of Armenia and the shores of theCaspian, and extend to the Scythians, whose mode of life issimilar in every respect. The other seven kingdoms of Parthiabear the name of the Lower provinces. As to the Parthithemselves, Parthia<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> always lay at the foot of the mountains<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>so often mentioned, which overhang all these nations. On theeast it is bounded by the Arii, on the south by Carmania andthe Ariani, on the west by the Pratitæ, a people of the Medi,and on the north by the Hyrcani: it is surrounded by desertson every side. The more distant of the Parthi are calledNomades;<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> on this side of them there are deserts. On the<pb n="2069" />west are the cities of Issatis and Calliope, already mentioned,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>on the north-east Europus,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> on the south-east Maria; in themiddle there are Hecatompylos,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> Arsace, and Nisiæa, a finedistrict of Parthiene, in which is Alexandropolis, so called fromits founder.(26.) It is requisite in this place to trace the localities of theMedi also, and to describe in succession the features of the country as far as the Persian Sea, in order that the account whichfollows may be the better understood. Media<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> lies crosswise tothe west, and so presenting itself obliquely to Parthia, closes theentrance of both kingdoms<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> into which it is divided. It has,then, on the east, the Caspii and the Parthi; on the south,Sittacene, Susiane, and Persis; on the west, Adsiabene; andon the north, Armenia. The Persæ have always inhabitedthe shores of the Red Sea, for which reason it has receivedthe name of the Persian Gulf. This maritime region of Persishas the name of Ciribo;<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> on the side on which it runs upto that of the Medi, there is a place known by the name ofClimax Megale,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> where the mountains are ascended by asteep flight of stairs, and so afford a narrow passage which leadsto Persepolis,<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> the former capital of the kingdom, destroyed by<pb n="2070" />Alexander. It has also, at its extreme frontier, Laodicea,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>founded by Antiochus. To the east of this place is thefortress of Passagarda,<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> held by the Magi, at which spot isthe tomb of Cyrus; also Ecbatana,<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> a city of theirs, the inhabitants of which were removed by Darius to the mountains.Between the Parthi and the Ariani projects the territory ofthe Parætaceni.<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> By these nations and the river Euphratesare the Lower kingdoms of Parthia bounded; of the otherswe shall speak after Mesopotamia, which we shall now describe, with the exception of that angle of it and the peoples ofArabia, which have been already mentioned in a formerbook.<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The provinces of Parthia have been already mentioned in detail inthe preceding Chapters, except Susiana and Elymais, which are mentionedin c. 31.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The original Parthia, the modern Khorassan.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The so-called Caucasian chain.

This causeway,which at the present day bears the name of Jaddehi-Atabeg, or the "roadof the Atabegs," was looked upon by several historians as one of thewonders of the world, who gave it the name of the Climax Megale or "GreatLadder."
