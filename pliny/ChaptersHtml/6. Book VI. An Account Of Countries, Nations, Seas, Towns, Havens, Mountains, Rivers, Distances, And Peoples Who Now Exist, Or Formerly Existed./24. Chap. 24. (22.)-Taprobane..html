<div2 type="chapter" n="24" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 24. (22.)—TAPROBANE.</head><p>Taprobane,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> under the name of the "land of the Antich-thones,"<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> was long looked upon as another world: the age andthe arms of Alexander the Great were the first to give satisfactory proof that it is an island. Onesicritus, the commander ofhis fleet, has informed us that the elephants of this island arelarger, and better adapted for warfare than those of India; andfrom Megasthenes we learn that it is divided by a river, thatthe inhabitants have the name of Paleogoni,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and that their<pb n="2052" />country is more productive of gold and pearls of great size thaneven India. Eratosthenes has also given the dimensions ofthis island, as being seven thousand stadia in length, and fivethousand in breadth: he states also that there are no cities, butvillages to the number of seven hundred.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> It begins at theEastern sea, and lies extended opposite to India, east and west.This island was in former times supposed to be twenty days'sail from the country of the Prasii,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> but in later times, whereas the navigation was formerly confined to vessels constructedof papyrus with the tackle peculiar to the Nile, the distancehas been estimated at no more than seven days'<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> sail, in reference to the speed which can be attained by vessels of ourconstruction. The sea that lies between the island and themainland is full of shallows, not more than six paces in depth;but in certain channels it is of such extraordinary depth, that noanchor has ever found a bottom. For this reason it is that thevessels are constructed with prows at either end; so that theremay be no necessity for tacking while navigating these channels,which are extremely narrow. The tonnage of these vessels isthree thousand amphoræ.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> In traversing their seas, the peopleof Taprobane take no observations of the stars, and indeed theGreater Bear<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> is not visible to them; but they carry birds outto sea, which they let go from time to time, and so follow theircourse as they make for the land. They devote only fourmonths in the year to the pursuits of navigation, and are particularly careful not to trust themselves on the sea during thenext hundred days after our summer solstice, for in those seasit is at that time the middle of winter.<pb n="2053" /></p><p>Thus much we learn from the ancient writers; it has fallento our lot, however, to obtain a still more accurate knowledgeof these people; for during the reign of the Emperor Claudius,an embassy came from even this distant island to Rome. Thecircumstances under which this took place were as follow:Annius Plocamus had farmed from the treasury the revenuesarising from the Red Sea. A certain freedman of his, whilesailing around Arabia, was carried away by a gale from thenorth beyond the coast of Carmania. In the course of fifteendays he had drifted to Hippuros, a port of Taprobane, wherehe was most kindly and hospitably received by the king; andhaving, after a study of six months, become well acquaintedwith the language, was enabled to answer all his enquiries relative to the Romans and their emperor. But of all that heheard, the king was more particularly struck with surprise atour rigid notions of justice, on ascertaining that among themoney found on the captive, the denarii were all of equalweight, although the different figures on them plainly showedthat they had been struck in the reigns of several emperors.By this circumstance in especial, the king was prompted to forman alliance with the Romans, and accordingly sent to Rome anembassy, consisting of four persons, the chief of whom wasItachias.<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span></p><p>From these persons we learned that in Taprobane there arefive hundred towns, and that there is a harbour that lies facingthe south, and adjoining the city of Palæsimundus,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> the mostfamous city in the isle, the king's place of residence, and containing a population of two hundred thousand. They also informed us that in the interior there is a lake called Megisba, threehundred and seventy-five miles in circumference, and containingislands which are fertile, though for pasturage only. In this lakethey informed us two rivers take their rise, one of which, calledPalesimundus, flows into the harbournear the city of that name,by three channels, the narrowest of which is five stadia in width,the largest fifteen; while the other, Cydara by name, takes a direction northward, towards the Indian coast. We learned also<pb n="2054" />that the nearest point of the Indian coast is a promontoryknown as Coliacum,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> distant from the island four days' sail, andthat midway between them lies the island of the Sun. Theystated also that those seas are of a deep green tint; besideswhich, there are numerous trees growing at the bottom, so muchso, that the rudders of the vessels frequently break off portionsof their foliage.<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> They were much astonished at the constellations which are visible to us, the Greater Bear and the Pleiades,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> as though they had now beheld a new expanse of theheavens; and they declared that in their country the mooncan only be seen above the horizon<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> from the eighth to itssixteenth day. They also stated that Canopus, a large brightstar, gives light to them by night. But what surprised themmore than anything, was that the shadow of their bodies wasthrown towards our hemisphere<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> and not theirs, and that thesun arose on the left hand and set on the right, and not in theopposite direction.<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> They also informed us that the side oftheir island which lies opposite to India is ten thousand stadiain length, and runs in a south-easterly direction—that beyondthe Emodian Mountains they look towards<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> the Serve, whose<pb n="2055" />acquaintance they had also made in the pursuits of commerce;that the father of Rachias had frequently visited their country,and that the Seræ always came to meet them on their arrival.These people, they said, exceeded the ordinary human height,had flaxen hair, and blue eyes, and made an uncouth sort of noiseby way of talking, having no language of their own for the pur-pose of communicating their thoughts. The rest of their information<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> was of a similar nature to that communicated by ourmerchants. It was to the effect that the merchandize on salewas left by them upon the opposite bank of a river on theircoast, and it was then removed by the natives, if they thoughtproper to deal on terms of exchange. On no grounds oughtluxury with greater reason to be detested by us, than if we onlytransport our thoughts to these scenes, and then reflect, whatare its demands, to what distant spots it sends in order tosatisfy them, and for how mean and how unworthy an end!</p><p>But yet Taprobane even, isolated as it is by nature from therest of the world, is not exempt from our vices. Gold andsilver are held in esteem even there. They have a marblewhich resembles tortoise-shell in appearance; this, as wellas their pearls and precious stones, is highly valued; all ourluxuries in fact, those even of the most exquisite nature, arethere carried to the very highest pitch. They asserted that theirwealth is much greater than ours, but admitted that we knowbetter than they how to obtain real enjoyment from opulence.</p><p>In this island no slavery exists; they do not prolong theirsleep to day-break, nor indeed during any part of the day;their buildings are only of a moderate height from the ground;the price of corn is always the same; they have no courts oflaw and no litigation. Hercules is the deity whom they worship;<pb n="2056" />SABTULand their king is chosen by the people, an aged man always,distinguished for his mild and clement disposition, and withoutchildren. If after he has been elected king, he happens tobecome the father of children, his abdication is the consequence;this is done that there may be no danger of the sovereign powerbecoming hereditary. Thirty advisers are provided for him bythe people, and it is only by the advice of the majority of themthat any man is condemned to capital punishment. Even then,the person so condemned has a right of appealing to the people,in which case a jury consisting of seventy persons is appointed.Should these acquit the accused, the thirty counsellors are nolonger held in any estimation, but are visited with the greatestdisgrace. The king wears the costume of Father Liber,<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> whilethe rest of the people dress like the natives of Arabia. Theking, if he is found guilty of any offence, is condemned to death;but no one slays him; all turn their backs upon him, and refuseto hold any communication or even discourse with him. Theirfestivals are celebrated<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> with the chase, the most valued sportsbeing the pursuit of the tiger and the elephant. The landsare carefully tilled; the vine is not cultivated there, but of otherfruits there is great abundance. They take great delight infishing, and especially in catching turtles; beneath the shells<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span>of which whole families find an abode, of such vast size arethey to be found. These people look upon a hundred years asa comparatively short life. Thus much have we learned respecting Taprobane.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Although Poinsinet will not admit its identity, it is now universallyagreed among the learned that the island of Taprobana is the modernCeylon. As Gosselin observes, in the accounts said to have been given ofCeylon by the ambassadors to Claudius, great allowance must be made forthe wrong interpretation which, owing to their ignorance of the language,the Romans must have given to much of their narrative.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From <foreign lang="greek">a)nti,</foreign> "opposite," and <foreign lang="greek">xqw/n,</foreign> "the earth." Its people beingsupposed to be the <hi rend="ital">antipodes</hi> of those of Europe.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"The ancient race." As Ansart observes, the island contains amountain, the name of which is "Adam's" Peak.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ælian makes the villages to be 750 in number.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A general term probably, as already stated, for the great peninsula ofIndia, below the Ganges.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This expression has been relied upon by those who do not admit thatCeylon is identical with the ancient Taprobana. But it is not improbablethat the passage here referred to is from Cape Comorin to Ceylon, and notfrom Cape Ramanan Cor, the nearest part of the continent. In such case,the distance would be sixty-five or sixty-six leagues, and we can easilyconceive that Greek vessels, sailing from nine to ten leagues per day,might occupy seven days in making the passage from Cape Comorin, pastRamanan Cor, to the coasts of Ceylon.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The amphora, as a measure, contained eight congii, or forty-eightsextarii.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "Septentrio;" "the Seven Trions," which was more especiallyemployed by the nations of Europe for the purposes of navigation.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Parisot suggests that the word "Radijah," or "Rajah," denotingthe rank which he held, may have been here taken by Pliny for his name.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ptolemy says that the ancient name of the island was Simundi, orPalæsimundi, but speaks of no such city as the one here mentioned, norindeed of any other of the localities described by Pliny.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is difficult to say whether by this name is meant the modern CapeComorin, or that known as Ramanan Cor, which is in reality the nearestpoint to the coast of Ceylon. Perhaps the latter is meant; in which caseit is not improbable that the Island of the Sun will be represented by theislet called Rameserum in the maps, or else the one adjoining calledManaar. It must not be confounded with the Island of the Sun, mentioned in c. 26. See p. 60.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is not improbable that he alludes to coral reefs.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This assertion Gosselin would either reject as a fabulous falsehood, oras having originated in some misconception on the part of the Romans;for, as he remarks, it is quite impossible that the Pleiades should be aconstellation unknown at that time to the people of Ceylon; but, on theother hand, it would be equally true that the Greater Bear was concealedfrom them.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This was also a fable, or else originated in misapprehension of theirlanguage on the part of the Romans.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Gosselin remarks that their story may have been that for aboutseven months in the year the shadows fell to the north, and during theremaining five to the south, which would not have been inconsistent withthe truth.</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This also is classed by Gosselin under the head either of fabulousstories or misapprehensions.</p><p><span id="note_17"><a href="#ref_17">17. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Scras—ab ipsis aspici." It is difficult to say whether this does notmean that they were in sight of the coast of the Seræ.-Under any circumstances, the Seræ here spoken of must not be taken for the Seres or supposed Chinese. Gosselin remarks that under this name the people ofa district called Sera are probably referred to, and that in fact such is thename of a city and a whole province at the present day, situate on theopposite coast, beyond the mountains which terminate the plains of theCarnatic. It is equally impossible that under the name of "Emodi"Pliny can allude to the Himalaya chain, distant more than 2000 miles.The mountains, on the verge of the plains of the Carnatic, are not improbably those here referred to, and it is not impossible that they may bediscerned from the shores of Ceylon. Gosselin is of opinion that thename of the ancient Seræ may still be traced in that of Seringapatam,and of the city of Seringham, situate on the river Godavery.</p><p><span id="note_18"><a href="#ref_18">18. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Relative to the Seræ, or inhabitants of the opposite shores.</p><p><span id="note_19"><a href="#ref_19">19. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "Bacchus." This means that he wears a long robe with a train;much like the dress, in fact, which was worn on the stage by tragic actors.</p><p><span id="note_20"><a href="#ref_20">20. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Festa venatione absumi, gratissimam earn tigribus elephantisqueconstare." Holland gives this sentence quite a different meaning, fancying that it bears reference to the mode in which the guilty king comes tohis end, which, indeed, otherwise does not appear to be stated. "But todoe him to death in the end, they appoint a solemne day of hunting,right pleasant and agreable unto tigres and elephants, before which beaststhey expose their king, and so he is presently by them devoured." It isdifficult to say, however, where he finds all this.</p><p><span id="note_21"><a href="#ref_21">21. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is much more probable that they used the shells for the purposeof making roofs for their habitations.</p></body>
