(24.)—MEMORY.</head><p>It would be far from easy to pronounce what person has beenthe most remarkable for the excellence of his memory, thatblessing so essential for the enjoyment of life, there havingbeen so many who have been celebrated for it. King Cyrusknew all the soldiers of his army by name:<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> L. Scipio thenames of all the Roman people. Cineas, the ambassador ofking Pyrrhus, knew by name all the members of the senateand the equestrian order, the day after his arrival at Rome.<pb n="2165" />Mithridates,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> who was king of twenty-two nations, administered their laws in as many languages, and could harangueeach of them, without employing an interpreter. There wasin Greece a man named Charmidas, who, when a personasked him for any book in a library, could repeat it by heart,just as though he were reading. Memory, in fine, has beenmade an art; which was first invented by the lyric poet, Simonides,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and perfected by Metrodorus of Scepsis, so as toenable persons to repeat word for word exactly what they haveheard.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> Nothing whatever, in man, is of so frail a nature asthe memory; for it is affected by disease, by injuries, and evenby fright; being sometimes partially lost, and at other timesentirely so. A man, who received a blow from a stone, forgotthe names of the letters only;<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> while, on the other hand,another person, who fell from a very high roof, could not somuch as recollect his mother, or his relations and neighbours.Another person, in consequence of some disease, forgot hisown servants even; and Messala Corvinus, the orator, lost allrecollection of his own name. And so it is, that very often thememory appears to attempt, as it were, to make its escape fromus, even while the body is at rest and in perfect health.When sleep, too, comes over us, it is cut off altogether; somuch so, that the mind, in its vacancy, is at a loss to knowwhere we are.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span><pb n="2166" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This statement is also made by Val. Maximus, B. viii. c. 7. Xenophon, Cyropædia, B. v., speaks of the retentive memory of Cyrus, but considerably qualifies the account here given: he says that Cyrus knew thenames of all his commanders or prefects, and of all those to whom he hadoccasion to give particular orders.—B.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This account is similar to that given by Val. Maximus, B. viii. c. 7,and by Aulus Gellius, B. xvii. c. 7. We have a learned dissertation byAjasson, in which he discusses the possibility of one individual understanding so great a number of languages, as well as the question, whetherit is possible that so great a number of languages were spoken by the subjects of Mithridates. His conclusions greatly tend to prove both thesepoints; Lemaire, vol. iii. p. 295.—B.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This invention is referred to by Cicero, De Nat. Deor., B. ii. c. 86.Cicero also speaks of the remarkable powers of memory possessed by Charmidas and Metrodorus, De Oratore, B. ii. c. 88, and Tusc. Quæst. B. i. e.24.—B.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ajasson gives an account of some of the principal writers in whathas been termed the science of Mnemonics, or artificial memory: he particularly commends the lectures of Aimé of Paris on the subject; Lemaire,vol. iii. p. 310, <hi rend="ital">et seq.</hi>—B.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This circumstance is related by Val. Maximus, B. i. e. 8.—B.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is not always the case. In dreams we often recollect past eventsand localities; we know in what part of the world we are, and even remember the substance of former dreams, and the fact that we have dreamtof a similar subject before.</p></body>
