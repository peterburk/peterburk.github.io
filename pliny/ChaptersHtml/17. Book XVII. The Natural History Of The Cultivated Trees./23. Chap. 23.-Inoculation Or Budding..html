By theaid of an instrument similar to a shoe-maker's paring-knifean eye is opened in a tree by paring away the bark, andanother bud is then enclosed in it, that has been previously removed with the same instrument from another tree. This was theancient mode of inoculation with the fig and the apple. Thatagain, described by Virgil,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> requires a slight fissure to bemade in the knot of a bud which has burst through the bark,and in this is enclosed a bud taken from another tree. Thusfar has Nature been our instructor in these matters.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Still used for the reproduction of fruit-trees and shrubs in the pleasuregarden.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Georg. ii. 73</p></body>
