Indeed, it was generally the practice toadminister other substances to promote vomiting, and to carryoff the hellebore by the aid of purgatives or clysters, whilebleeding even was frequently had recourse to. In addition toall this, however successful the results may prove, the symptomsby which it is attended are really most alarming, by reason of<pb n="5100" />the various colours which the matter vomited presents: besideswhich, after the vomiting has subsided, the physician has topay the greatest attention to the nature of the alvine evacuations, the due and proper use of the bath, and the generalregimen adopted by the patient; all of them inconveniencesin themselves, and preceded by the terrors naturally inspiredby the character of the drug; for one story is, that it has theproperty of consuming flesh, if boiled with it.</p><p>The great error,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> however, on the part of the ancients was,that in consequence of these fears, they used to give it toosparingly, the fact being, that the larger the dose, the morespeedily it passes through the body. Themison used to giveno more than two drachmæ, but at a later period as much asfour drachmæ was administered; in conformity with the cele-brated eulogium passed upon it by Herophilus,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> who was inthe habit of comparing hellebore to a valiant general, andsaying, that after it has set in motion all within, it is thefirst to sally forth and show the way. In addition to theseparticulars, there has been a singular discovery made: thehellebore which, as we have already stated, has been cut witha small pair of scissors,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> is passed through a sieve, upon whichthe pith makes its way through, while the outer coat remainsbehind. The latter acts as a purgative, while the former isused for the purpose of arresting vomiting when that evacuationis in excess.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Its properties, Fée says, are not more active than those of black hellebore.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Fée remarks, that they showed their wisdom in this.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Herophilus, it must be remembered, lived a considerable time beforeThemison.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Forficulis."
