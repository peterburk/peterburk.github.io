Cornelius Nepos relates that great was theastonishment, when P. Lentulus Spinther exhibited amphoræmade of this material, as large as Chian wine-vessels insize; "and yet, five years after," says he, "I saw columns ofthis material, no less than two-and-thirty feet in height." Ata more recent period again, some change took place<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> withreference to this stone; for four<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> small pillars of it wereerected by Cornelius Balbus in his Theatre<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> as somethingquite marvellous: and I myself have seen thirty columns, oflarger size, in the banquetting-room which Callistus<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> erected,the freedman of Claudius, so well known for the influencewhich he possessed.</p><p>(8.) This<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> stone is called "alabastrites"<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> by some, and ishollowed out into vessels for holding unguents, it having thereputation of preserving them from corruption<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> better thananything else. In a calcined state, it is a good ingredient for<pb n="6330" />plaisters.<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> It is found in the vicinity of Thebes in Egypt andof Damascus in Syria, that of Damascus being whiter than theothers. The most esteemed kind, however, is that of Carmania,the next being the produce of India, and then, those ofSyria and Asia. The worst in quality is that of Cappadocia,it being utterly destitute of lustre. That which is of a honeycolour is the most esteemed, covered with spots curling inwhirls,<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> and not transparent. Alabastrites is considered defective,when it is of a white or horn colour, or approachingto glass in appearance.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ajasson remarks that under this name the ancients meant, first, yellowcalcareous Alabaster, and secondly, Chalcedony, unclassified.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See end of the present Book.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. vi. cc. 27, 23, 32.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Variatum est."</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ajasson thinks that these columns, in reality, were made, in bothinstances, of yellow jasper, or else yellow sardonyx, a compound of sardand chalcedony.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Erected A.U.C. 741.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxxiii. c. 47.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The reading here is doubtful, and it is questionable whether he considers the two stones as identical.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably calcareous Alabaster, Ajasson thinks.
