"It is to me," she says,"that man is indebted for the greater part of his enjoyments,<pb n="4458" />it is I that produce for him the flowing wine and the tricklingoil, it is I that ripen the date and other fruits in numbers sovaried; and all this, not insisting, like the earth, on their purchase at the cost of fatigues and labours. No necessity do Icreate for ploughing with the aid of oxen, for beating outupon the threshing-floor, or for bruising under the millstone,and all in order that man may earn his food at some indefinitetime by this vast expenditure of toil. As for me, all my giftsare presented to him ready prepared: for no anxieties orflatigues do they call, but, on the contrary, they offer them-selves spontaneously, and even fall to the ground, if manshould be too indolent to reach them as they hang." Vyingeven with herself, Pomona has done still more for our practical advantage than for the mere gratification of our pleasuresand caprices.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. xii. cc. 60 and 61.</p></body>
