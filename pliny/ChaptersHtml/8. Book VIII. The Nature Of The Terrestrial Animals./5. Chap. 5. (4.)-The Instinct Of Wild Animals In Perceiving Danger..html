(4.)ÑTHE INSTINCT OF WILD ANIMALS IN PERCEIVING DANGER.</head><p>It is a wonderful thing, that most animals are aware whyit is that they are sought after, and what it is, that, under allcircumstances, they have to guard against. When an elephanthappens to meet a man in the desert, who is merely wanderingabout, the animal, it is said, shows himself both merciful andkind, and even points out the way. But the very sameanimal, if he meets with the traces of a man,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> before he meetsthe man himself, trembles in every limb, for fear of an ambush, stops short and scents the wind, looks around him, andsnorts aloud with rage; and then, without trampling upon theobject, digs it up,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and passes it to the next one, who againpasses it to the one that follows, and so on from one to theother, till it comes to the very last. The herd then facesabout, returns, and ranges itself in order of battle; so stronglydoes the odour, in all cases, attach itself to the human footstep, even though, as is most frequently the case, the foot itselfis not naked. In the same way, too, the tigress, which is thedread of the other wild beasts, and which sees, withoutalarm, the traces even of the elephant itself, is said at once,upon seeing the footsteps of man, to carry off her whelps.How has the animal acquired this knowledge? And wherehas it seen him before, of whom it stands in such dread?Doubt there can be none, that forests such as it haunts arebut little frequented by man! It is not to be wondered at, ifthey are astonished at the print of a footstep before unknown;but how should they know that there is anything that theyought to dread? And, what is still more, why should they dreadeven the very sight of man, seeing that they are so far supe-<pb n="2249" />rior to him in strength, size, and swiftness? No doubt, suchis the law of Nature, such is the influence of her power-themost savage and the very largest of wild beasts have neverseen that which they have reason to fear, and yet instantlyhave an instinctive feeling of dread, when the moment has comefor them to fear.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span></p><p>(5.) Elephants always move in herds.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> The oldest takesthe lead, and the next in age brings up the rear. When theyare crossing a river, they first send over the smallest, for fearlest the weight of the larger ones may increase the depthof the channel, by working away the bed of the river. Welearn from Antipater, that King Antiochus had two elephants,which he employed in his wars, and to which he had given thenames of celebrated men; and that they were aware too of thismark of distinction.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> Cato, in his Annals, while he has passedover in silence the names of the generals, has given that of anelephant called Surus, which fought with the greatest valourin the Carthaginian army, and had lost one of its tusks.When Antiochus was sounding the ford of a river, an elephantnamed Ajax, which on other occasions had always led the van,refused to enter the stream; upon which proclamation wasmade, that the first rank should belong to the one which shouldtake the lead in passing over. One called Patroclus hazardedthe attempt, and as a reward, the king presented it with somesilver pendants,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> a kind of ornament with which these animalsare particularly delighted, and assigned it all the other marks of<pb n="2250" />command. Upon this, the elephant that had been degraded refused to take its food, and so preferred death to ignominy. Indeed their sense of shame is wonderful, and when one of themhas been conquered, it flies at the voice of the conqueror, andpresents him with earth and vervain.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span></p><p>These animals are sensible to feelings of modesty; theynever couple but in secret:<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> the male after it has attained itsfifth year, the female after the age of ten.<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> It is said, thattheir intercourse takes place only every second year, and forfive days only, and no more; on the sixth day they plungeinto a river, before doing which they will not rejoin the herd.Adulterous intercourse is unknown to them, and they have noneof those deadly combats for the possession of the female, whichtake place among the other animals. Nor is this because theyare uninfluenced by the passion of love. One in Egypt, weare told, fell in love with a woman, who was a seller of garlands; and let no one suppose that he made a vulgar choice, forshe was the especial object of the love of Aristophanes, whoheld the very highest rank as a grammarian. Another becameattached to the youth Menander, a native of Syracuse, in thearmy of Ptolemy; whenever it did not see him, it would manifestthe regret which it experienced, by refusing its food. Jubagives an account also of a female who dealt in perfumes, towhom one of these creatures formed an attachment. Allthese animals manifested their attachment by their signs of joyat the sight of the person, by their awkward caresses, and bykeeping for them and throwing into their bosom the piecesof money which the public had given them.<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> Nor, indeed,<pb n="2251" />ought we to be surprised, that an animal which possesses memory should be sensible of affection: for the same author relates, that an elephant recognized, after the lapse of manyyears, an old man who had been its keeper in his youth.They would seem also to have an instinctive feeling of justice.King Bocchus once fastened thirty elephants to the stake,with the determination of wreaking his vengeance on them,by means of thirty others; but though men kept sallyingforth among them to goad them on, he could not, with all hisendeavours, force them to become the ministers of the crueltyof others.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The word employed is <hi rend="ital">vestigiun;</hi> it is explained by ®lian to refer tothe herbage, which has received both the visible impression as well as theodour of the foot.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In the case of a footstep, this must mean the ground with which thefoot has come in contact.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is a general opinion, and one founded upon observations of dailyoccurrence, that animals have an instinctive dread of man. We have,however, facts stated by travellers of undoubted veracity, which wouldlead to an opposite conclusion. One of the most remarkable is the account which Denham gives of the tameness of the birds in Lake Tchad.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier observes, that this is correct; see Ajasson, vol. vi. p. 408, andLemaire, vol. iii. p. 338.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Novere ea." It is doubtful whether these words do not meansomething more than merely "knew their names," as Hardouin explainsit, for that would be nothing wonderful in an elephant. On the otherhand, to say that they were aware of the honour which had been conferredon them, in giving the names of famous men, would be to make a statement which exceeds belief; for how could the elephants <hi rend="ital">show</hi> that theyappreciated this honour, even supposing that they did appreciate it? Pliny'selliptical style repeatedly gives rise to doubts of this nature.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Phaleris." See Notes to B. vii. c. 29, p. 170.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny informs us, in B. xxii. c. 4, that this was done by those conquered in battle.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We may conclude, from the account given by Aristotle, Hist. Anim.B. v. c. 2, and by ®lian, B. viii. c. 17, that this opinion was generallyadopted by the ancients.ÑB. We learn from Cuvier, who mentions theresults of M. Corse's observations, that there is no such modesty in theelephant, and that the two at the Museum of Natural History at Parisgave proof of the fact.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is erroneous; the males do not arrive at puberty before thefemales, which takes place about the fourteenth or fifteenth year. In theelephant which was under the inspection of M. Corse, the period of gestation was between twenty and twenty-one months, so that there may besome foundation for the biennial period, but the term of five days is entirely imaginary. Aristotle makes the interval three years.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There is a passage in Suetonius, in his Life of Augustus, and one inMacrobius, where the custom of offering pieces of money to elephants, whichthey took up with the proboscis, is referred to.ÑB.</p></body>
