We have sent several expeditions againstArabia, and the Roman arms have penetrated into the greaterpart of that country; indeed, Caius C¾sar,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> the son of Augustus, even earned considerable renown there; and yet this treehas been described by no Latin writer, at least that I knowof. The descriptions given of it by the Greek writers varyvery considerably: some of them say that it has exactly theleaf of the pear-tree, only somewhat smaller, and of a grass-green colour. Others, again, say, that it has a rather reddishleaf, like that of the mastich, and others, that it is a kind ofterebinth,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and that King Antigonus, to whom a branch of itwas brought, was of that opinion. King Juba, in the workwhich he wrote and dedicated to Caius C¾sar, the son ofAugustus, who was inflamed by the wide-spread renown ofArabia, states, that the tree has a spiral stem, and that thebranches bear a considerable resemblance to those of the Ponticmaple, while it secretes a sort of juice very similar to that of<pb n="3126" />the almond-tree. Such, he says, is the appearance of the treeas seen in Carmania and Egypt, where it was introduced andplanted under the auspices of the Ptolemies when reigningthere. It is well known that it has a bark not unlike that ofthe laurel, and, indeed, some persons have asserted that theirleaves are similar. At all events, such was the case with thetree as it grew at Sardes: for the kings of Asia also took considerable care to have it planted there. The ambassadorswho in my time have come to Rome from Arabia, have madeall these matters more uncertain, even, than they were before;a thing at which we may justly be surprised, seeing thatsome sprigs even of the incense-tree have been brought amongus, from which we have some reason to conclude that theparent tree is round and tapering, and that it puts forth itsshoots from a trunk that is entirely free from knots.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. vi. cc. 31 and 32.
