Æmilius, who was consul<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> with QuintusLutatius, not only erected these shields in the ÆmilianBasilica,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> but in his own house as well; in doing whichhe followed a truly warlike example. For, in fact, theseportraits were represented on bucklers, similar to those usedin the Trojan War;<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and hence it is that these shields receivedtheir present name of "clypei," and not, as the perverse<pb n="6228" />subtleties of the grammarians will have it, from the word"cluo."<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> It was an abundant motive for valour, when uponeach shield was represented the features of him who had borneit. The Carthaginians used to make both their bucklers and theirportraits of gold, and to carry them with them in the camp: atall events, Marcius, the avenger of the Scipios<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> in Spain, foundone of this kind on capturing the camp of Hasdrubal, and itwas this same buckler that remained suspended over the gate ofthe Capitoline Temple until the time when it was first burnt.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>Indeed, in the days of our ancestors, so assured was the safetyof these shields, that it has been a subject of remark, that inthe consulship of L. Manlius and Q. Fulvius, in the year ofthe City, 575, M. Aufidius, who had given security for thesafety of the Capitol, informed the senate that the bucklersthere which for some lustra<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> had been assessed as copper,were in reality made of silver.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A.U.C. 671.—B.
