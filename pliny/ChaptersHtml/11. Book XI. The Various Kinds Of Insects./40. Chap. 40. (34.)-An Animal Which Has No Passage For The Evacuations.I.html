<div2 type="chapter" n="40" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 40. (34.)ÑAN ANIMAL WHICH HAS NO PASSAGE FOR THEEVACUATIONS.i</head><p>There is an animal,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> also, that is generated in the summer,<pb n="3041" />which has its head always buried deep in the skill [of a beast],and so, living on its blood, swells to a large size. This isthe only living creature that has no outlet<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> for its food;hence, when it has overgorged itself, it bursts asunder, and thusits very aliment is made the cause of its death. This insectnever breeds on beasts of burden, but is very commonlyseen on oxen, and sometimes on dogs, which, indeed, are subject to every species of vermin. With sheep and goats, itis the only parasite. The thirst, too, for blood displayed byleeches, which we find in marshy waters, is no less singular;for these will thrust the entire head into the flesh in quest ofit. There is a winged insect<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> which peculiarly infests dogs,and more especially attacks them with its sting about theears, where they are unable to defend themselves with theirteeth.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He alludes to dog-ticks and ox-ticks, the Acarus ricinus of Linn¾us,and the Acarus reduvius of Schrank.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In c. 32 he has said the same of the grasshopper, in relation to itsdrink.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A variety of the Cynips of Linn¾us, which in vast numbers willsometimes adhere to the ears of dogs.</p></body>
