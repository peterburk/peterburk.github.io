FIVE REMEDIES DERIVED FROM IT.</head><p>Let the following stand as a remarkable proof of the frivolous nature of the magic art. Of all animals it is the molethat the magicians admire most! a creature that has beenstamped with condemnation by Nature in so many ways;doomed as it is to perpetual blindness,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and adding to thisdarkness a life of gloom in the depths of the earth, and a statemore nearly resembling that of the dead and buried. Thereis no animal in the entrails of which they put such implicitfaith, no animal, they think, better suited for the rites of religion; so much so, indeed, that if a person swallows the heart ofa mole, fresh from the body and still palpitating, he will receivethe gift of divination, they assure us, and a foreknowledge offuture events. Tooth-ache, they assert, may be cured bytaking the tooth of a live mole, and attaching it to the body.As to other statements of theirs relative to this animal, weshall draw attention to them on the fitting occasions, and shallonly add here that one of the most probable of all their assertions is, that the mole neutralizes the bite of the shrew-mouse;seeing that, as already<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> stated, the very earth even that isfound in the rut of a cart-wheel, acts as a remedy in such acase.<pb n="5430" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A mistake, of course; and one for which there is little excuse, as itseyes are easily perceptible. It is not improbable, however, that it was animpression with the ancients that its sight is impeded by the horny coveringof its eyes.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. xxix. c. 27.</p></body>
