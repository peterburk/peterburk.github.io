<div2 type="chapter" n="64" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 64.—FABRICS CALLED CONCHYLIATED.</head><p>Fabrics that are called conchyliated are subjected to thesame process in all other respects, but without any admixtureof the juice of the buccinum; in addition to which, the liquidis mixed with water and human urine in equal parts,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> one-half<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> only of the proportion of dye being used for the same quantity of wool. From this mixture a full colour is not obtained,but that pale tint, which is so highly esteemed; and the clearer<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>it is, the less of it the wool has imbibed.</p><p>(40.) The prices of these dyes vary in proportion to thequantity produced by the various shores; still, however, thosewho are in the habit of paying enormous prices for them, mayas well be informed that on no occasion ought the juice of<pb n="2449" />of the pelagiæ to exceed fifty,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and that of the buccinum onehundred sesterces for one hundred pounds.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Pro indiviso."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Dimidia et medicamina adduntur." This, no doubt, is the sense ofthe passage, as it is evident that only a thinner dye was required for tint,though at first sight it would appear as though one-half more were required for the same quantity of wool. The quantity therefore would be155 1/2 pounds of dye to fifty pounds of wool.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Tantoque dilutior, quanto magis vellera esuriunt." This seems tobe the meaning of the passage: some commentators would read "dilucidior" for "dilutior," and it would appear to be preferable.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There can be little doubt that Salmasius is right in his conjecture thatthe reading here should be "quingentos," "five hundred," instead of "quinquagenos," "fifty:" as it is evident from what Pliny has said in previousChapters, that the juices of the pelagia were considerably more valuablethan those of the buccinum.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He states this by way of warning to those who are in the habit ofpaying enormous prices for dyes, such as one hundred denarii for a pound,as mentioned in the last Chapter.</p></body>
