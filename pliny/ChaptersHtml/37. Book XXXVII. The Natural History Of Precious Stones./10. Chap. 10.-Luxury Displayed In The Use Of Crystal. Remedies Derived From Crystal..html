<div2 type="chapter" n="10" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 10.ÑLUXURY DISPLAYED IN THE USE OF CRYSTAL. REMEDIESDERIVED FROM CRYSTAL.</head><p>The largest block of crystal that has ever been beheld by<pb n="6396" />us, is the one that was consecrated by Julia Augusta in the Capitol,and which weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>Xenocrates speaks of having seen a vase of crystal, which heldone amphora,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and we find other writers mentioning a vesselfrom India which held four sextarii. For my own part, I canpositively say, that there is crystal amid the crags of the Alps,so difficult of access, that it is usually found necessary to besuspended by ropes in order to extract it. Persons who areexperienced in the matter detect its presence by certain signsand indications.</p><p>Crystal is subject to numerous defects, sometimes presentinga rough, solder-like, substance, or else clouded by spotsupon it; while occasionally it contains some hidden humour<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>within, or is traversed by hard and brittle knurrs,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>which are known as "salt grains."<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> Some crystal, too, has ared rust upon it, while, in other instances, it contains filamentsthat look like flaws, a defect which artists conceal byengraving it. But where crystals are entirely free from defect,they are preferred uncut; in which case, they are knownas "acenteta,"<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> and have the colour, not of foam, but oflimpid water. In the last place, the weight of crystals is apoint which is taken into consideration.</p><p>I find it stated by medical men that the very best cauteryfor the human body is a ball of crystal acted upon by the raysof the sun.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> This substance, too, has been made the object ofa mania; for, not many years ago, a mistress of a family,who was by no means very rich, gave one hundred and fiftythousand sesterces for a single basin made of crystal. Nero,on receiving tidings that all was lost, in the excess of hisfury, dashed two cups of crystal to pieces; this being his lastact of vengeance upon his fellow-creatures, preventing anyone from ever drinking again from these vessels. Crystal,when broken, cannot by any possibility be mended. Vessels in<pb n="6397" />glass have been brought to a marvellous degree of resemblanceto crystal; and yet, wonderful to say, they have only tendedto enhance the value of crystal, and in no way to depreciateit.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ajasson remarks that blocks have been found in Switzerland, weighingabove eight hundred pounds.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Forty-eight sextarii.
