(21.)ÑINSTANCES OF ACUTENESS OF SIGHT.</head><p>Instances of acuteness of sight are to be found stated, which,indeed, exceed all belief. Cicero informs us,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> that the Iliadof Homer was written on a piece of parchment so small as to beenclosed in a nut-shell. He makes mention also of a man whocould distinguish objects at a distance of one hundred and thirty-five miles.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> M. Varro says, that the name of this man wasStrabo; and that, during the Punic war, from Lilyb¾um, thepromontory of Sicily, he was in the habit of seeing the fleetcome out of the harbour of Carthage, and could even count thenumber of the vessels.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> Callicrates<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> used to carve ants and<pb n="2163" />other small animals in ivory, so minute in size, that otherpersons were unable to distinguish their individual parts.Myrmecides<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> also was famous in the same line;<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> this manmade, of similar material, a chariot drawn by four horses,which a fly could cover with its wings; as well as a ship whichmight be covered by the wings of a tiny bee.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This statement must have been in some of his lost works.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny probably here refers to a passage in the Acad. Qu¾st. B. iv. c.81, where Cicero speaks of a person who could see objects, it was said, ata distance of 1800 stadia, equal exactly to 125 miles.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The actual distance between the promontory of Sicily and the nearestpart of Carthage is between fifty and sixty miles. The acute vision ofStrabo is mentioned by Val. Maximus, B. i. e. 8.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See also B. xxxvi. c. 4. He was a Laced¾monian sculptor, who,according to Athen¾us, also executed embossed work on vases.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">His works in ivory were said to have been so small, that they couldscarcely be seen without placing them on black hair.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cicero, Acad. Qu¾st. B. iv. c. 120, speaks of "one Myrmecides, amaker of minute objects of art;" ®lian, Vac. Hist. B. i. c. 17, also speaksof these minute performances of Myrmecides, and styles them "a wasteof time." Pliny, in a subsequent part of his work, B. xxxi. c. 4, speaksof similar minute works, executed by these artists in marble; but the account which he gives is scarcely credible.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxxvi. c. 5.</p></body>
