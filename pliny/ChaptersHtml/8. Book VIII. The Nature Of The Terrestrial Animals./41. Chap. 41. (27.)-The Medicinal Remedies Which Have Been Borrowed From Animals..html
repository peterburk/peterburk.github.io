<div2 type="chapter" n="41" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 41. (27.)—THE MEDICINAL REMEDIES WHICH HAVE BEENBORROWED FROM ANIMALS. <span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span></head><p>The bird also, which is called the ibis,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> a native of the samecountry of Egypt, has shewn us some things of a similarnature. By means of its hooked beak, it laves the bodythrough that part, by which it is especially necessary forhealth that the residuous food should be discharged. Nor, indeed, are these the only inventions which have been borrowedfrom animals, to prove of use to man. The power of theherb dittany, in extracting arrows, was first disclosed to us bystags that had been struck by that weapon; the weapon being<pb n="2292" />discharged on their feeding upon this plant.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> The same animals, too, when they happen to have been wounded by thephalangium, a species of spider, or by any insect of a similarnature, cure themselves by eating crabs. One of the very bestremedies for the bite of the serpent, is the plant<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> with whichlizards treat their wounds when injured in fighting with eachother. The swallow has shown us that the chelidonia<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> isvery serviceable to the sight, by the fact of its employing itfor the cure of its young, when their eyes are affected. Thetortoise recruits its powers of effectually resisting serpents, byeating the plant which is known as cunile bubula;<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> and theweasel feeds on rue, when it fights with the serpent in thepursuit of mice.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> The stork cures itself of its diseases with wildmarjoram, and the wild boar with ivy, as also by eating crabs,and more particularly those that have been thrown up by thesea.<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> The snake, when the membrane which covers its body<pb n="2293" />has been contracted by the cold of winter, throws it off in thespring by the aid of the juices of fennel,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> and thus becomessleek and youthful in appearance. First of all, it disengagesthe head, and it then takes no less than a day and a night inworking itself out, and divesting itself of the membrane inwhich it has been enclosed. The same animal, too, on findingits sight weakened during its winter retreat, anoints and refreshes its eyes by rubbing itself on the plant called fennel ormarathrum; but if any of the scales are slow in coming off,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> itrubs itself against the thorns of the juniper. The dragon relieves the nausea which affects it in spring, with the juices ofthe lettuce.<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> The barbarous nations go to hunt the panther,provided with meat that has been rubbed with aconite,which is a poison.<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> Immediately on eating it, compressionof the throat overtakes them, from which circumstance it is,that the plant has received the name of pardalianches.<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> Theanimal, however, has found an antidote against this poison inhuman excrements; besides which, it is so eager to get atthem, that the shepherds purposely suspend them in a vessel,placed so high, that the animal cannot reach them even byleaping, when it endeavours to get at them; accordingly, itcontinues to leap until it has quite exhausted itself, and at lastexpires: otherwise, it is so tenacious of life, that it will con-<pb n="2294" />tinue to fight long after its intestines have been dragged out ofits body.</p><p>When an elephant has happened to devour a chameleon,which is of the same colour with the herbage, it counteractsthis poison by means of the wild olive. Bears, when theyhave eaten of the fruit of the mandrake, lick up numbers ofants.<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> The stag counteracts the effect of poisonous plants byeating the artichoke. Wood-pigeons, jackdaws, blackbirds,and partridges, purge themselves once a year by eating bayleaves; pigeons, turtle-doves, and poultry, with wall-pellitory,or helxine; ducks, geese, and other aquatic birds, with theplant sideritis or vervain; cranes, and birds of a similar nature,with the bulrush. The raven, when it has killed a chameleon, a contest in which even the conqueror suffers, counteracts the poison by means of laurel.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier remarks upon this and the following Chapter, that they areentirely fabulous. The diseases, remedies, and instructions given by theanimals are equally imaginary, although Pliny has taken the whole fromauthors of credit, and it has been repeated by Plutarch, De Iside, and byÆlian, Anim. Nat. B. ii. c. 35, and many others. Ajasson, vol. vi. p.446; Lemaire, vol. iii. p. 426.—B.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier has given an interesting account of the ibis, the opinions entertained of it by various travellers and naturalists, and a detail of theexamination which he made of two of its mummies, which were broughtby Grobert to Paris, from the wells of Sakhara. These mummies werefound to be similar to those previously examined by Buffon, Shaw, andothers, and proved the ibis of the ancient Egyptians to have been a speciesof curlew. This opinion he further supports by a reference to varioussculptures and mosaics, where this bird is represented, and he remarksupon the errors into which most travellers and historians have fallen as toit; the only correct account he conceives to be that of the African traveller,Bruce, who describes and figures it under the name of Abou hannès. Seethe extract in Lemaire, vol. iii. p. 633, <hi rend="ital">et seq.,</hi> from his <hi rend="ital">Recherches sur les</hi><hi rend="ital">Ossements Fossiles,</hi> vol. i. p. 141, <hi rend="ital">et seq.</hi> Herodotus gives an account ofthe ibis, B. i. c. 75, 76, but it is not correct.—B.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The fabulous account of the powers of this herb is referred to in B.xxv. c. 53, and supported by the highest authorities; among others, byAristotle, Hist. Anim. B. ix. c. 6.; Cicero, De Nat. Deor. B. ii. c. 50;Virgil, Æn. B. xii. c. 412.—B.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxii. c. 45, for a similar cure. It is not known what plant ishere alluded to, but it has been thought to be the cinara, or artichoke.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Chelidonium majus of Linnæus. It probably derived its namefrom the swallow, <foreign lang="greek">xeli/dwn,</foreign> because its flowers appear at the time thatbird makes its first appearance in the spring. This supposed property ismentioned by Ælian, Anim. Nat. B. iii. c. 25. Pliny speaks of its efficacyin diseases of the eyes, B. xxv. c. 50, and c. 91.—B.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny speaks of the medical virtues of cunile bubula, in B. xx. c. 61Columella, B. vi. c. 13, says that it is a cure for scabies. It is not certainwhat is the plant here referred to; it is considered identical with origanum,by Hardouin, and has been supposed by some to be marjoram, or pennyroyal. The effect of the cunile on the tortoise is mentioned by Aristotle,Hist. Anim. B. ix. c. 6; by Plutarch, Nat. Quæst.; Ælian, Anim. Nat.B. vi. c. 12; and by Albertus Magnus, B. viii. Tr. ii. c. 2; but there issome difference in their statements. Some speak of it as an antidote, enabling the tortoise to counteract the poison of the serpent, while othersregard it as giving the tortoise increased vigour to resist the attacks.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle, <hi rend="ital">ubisupra,</hi> and Ælian, Anim. Nat. B. iv. c. 14, refer to thissupposed fact, which is without foundation, so far, at least, as the contestof the weasels with the serpents and the rue are concerned. The hostility ofthe weasel to the mouse is probably correct. Pliny again refers to it, B.xx. c. 51, and it forms the subject of one of Phædrus's Fables, B. iv.c. 2.—B.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We have the same account in Plutarch.—B. Plutarch speaks, however,of the river crab.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny refers to this effect, B. xx. c. 95; he speaks also of its application to the eyes of the animal; it is probable, that feniculum and marathrum both refer to the same plant; the latter being the ordinary Greek,and the former the Latin, name. This effect of the feniculum is alsomentioned by Ælian, B. ix. c. 16.—B.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Si vero squamæ obtorpuere;" Hardouin supposes that this appliesparticularly to the eyes.—B. There can be little doubt that he is correctin that supposition.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle, <hi rend="ital">ubi supra,</hi> and Ælian, Anim. Nat. B. vi. c. 4, state that thedragon takes the juice of the <hi rend="ital">picris</hi> into the stomach, when overloaded withfood. The exact plant referred to, under that name, cannot be ascertainedfor certain; but it appears probable, that it is a wild lettuce or endive, orsome plant belonging to that family.—B.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This effect of aconite, and the antidote for it, are mentioned in B.xxvii. c. 2; they are also mentioned by Aristotle, <hi rend="ital">ubi supra;</hi> and by Ælian,Anim. Nat. B. iv. c. 49, and alluded to by Cicero, De. Nat. Deor. B. ii.c. 50. It appears from a statement of Tavernier, as referred to byHardouin, that the same antidote against poisoned weapons is still employed in the island of Java.—B.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From the Greek <foreign lang="greek">pardaliagxh\s,</foreign> "pard-strangle."</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is again referred to, B. xxix. c. 39.—B.</p></body>
