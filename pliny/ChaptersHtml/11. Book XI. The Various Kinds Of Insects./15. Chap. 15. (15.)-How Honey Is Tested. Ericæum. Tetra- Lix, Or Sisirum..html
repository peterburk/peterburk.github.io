TETRA-LIX, OR SISIRUM.</head><p>The crop of honey is most abundant if gathered at fullmoon, and it is richest when the weather is fine. In allhoney, that which flows of itself, like must or oil, has receivedfrom us the name of <hi rend="ital">acetum.</hi><span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> The summer honey is the mostesteemed of all, from the fact of its being made when theweather is driest: it is looked upon as the most serviceablewhen made from thyme;<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> it is then of a golden colour, andof a most delicious flavour. The honey that we see formedin the calix of flowers is of a rich and unctuous nature; thatwhich is made from rosemary is thick, while that which iscandied is little esteemed. Thyme honey does not coagulate,and on being touched will draw out into thin viscous threads,a thing which is the principal proof of its heaviness. Whenhoney shows no tenacity, and the drops immediately partfrom one another, it is looked upon as a sign of its worthlessness. The other proofs of its goodness are the fine aroma ofits smell, its being of a sweetness that closely borders on thesour,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and being glutinous and pellucid.</p><p>Cassius Dionysius is of opinion that in the summer gatheringthe tenth part of the honey ought to be left for the bees if thehives should happen to be well filled, and even if not, still inthe same proportion; while, on the other hand, if there is butlittle in them, he recommends that it should not be touchedat all. The people of Attica have fixed the period for commencing this gathering at the first ripening of the wild fig;others<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> have made it the day that is sacred to Vulcan.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span></p><p>(16.) The third kind of honey, which is the least esteemedof all, is the wild honey, known by the name of <hi rend="ital">ericeunm.</hi><span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> Itis collected by the bees after the first showers of autumn,when the heather<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> alone is blooming in the woods, from whichcircumstance it derives its sandy appearance. It is mostly pro-<pb n="3015" />duced at the rising of Arcturus, beginning at the day<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> beforethe ides of September. Some persons delay the gathering ofthe summer honey until the rising of Arcturus, because fromthen till the autumnal equinox there are fourteen days left,and it is from the equinox till the setting of the Vergiliæ, a period of forty-eight days, that the heather is in the greatest abundance. The Athenians call this plant by the name of <hi rend="ital">tetralix,</hi><span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>and the Eubœans <hi rend="ital">sisirum,</hi> and they look upon it as affordinggreat pleasure to the bees to browse upon, probably becausethere are no other flowers for them to resort to. This gathering terminates at the end of the vintage and the setting ofthe Vergiliæ, mostly about the ides of November.<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> Experience teaches us that we ought to leave for the bees two-thirds of this crop, and always that part of the combs as well,which contains the bee-bread.</p><p>From the winter solstice to the rising of Arcturus the beesare buried in sleep for sixty days, and live without any nourishment. Between the rising of Arcturus and the vernal equinox,they awake in the warmer climates, but even then they stillkeep within the hives, and have recourse to the provisionskept in reserve for this period. In Italy, however, they dothis immediately after the rising of the Vergiliæ, up to whichperiod they are asleep. Some persons, when they take thehoney, weigh the hive and all, and remove just as much asthey leave: a due sense of equity should always be stringentlyobserved in dealing with them, and it is generally stated thatif imposed upon in this division, the swarm will die of grief.It is particularly recommended also that the person who takesthe honey should be well washed and clean: bees have a particular aversion, too, to a thief and a menstruous woman. Whenthe honey is taken, it is the best plan to drive away the beesby means of smoke, lest they should become irritated, or elsedevour the honey themselves. By often applying smoke, too,they are aroused from their idleness to work; but if they havenot duly incubated in the comb, it is apt to become of alivid colour. On the other hand, if they are smoked too often,they will become tainted; the honey, too, a substance whichturns sour at the very slightest contact with dew, will very<pb n="3016" />quickly receive injury from the taint thus contracted: henceit is that among the various kinds of honey which are preserved, there is one which is known by the name of <hi rend="ital">acapnon.</hi><span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">" Vinegar" is the ordinary meaning.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Sillig remarks that the whole of this passage is corrupt.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hence, perhaps, its name of "acetum."</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The people of Italy.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The 10th of the calends of September, or 23rd August.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "heath-honey."
