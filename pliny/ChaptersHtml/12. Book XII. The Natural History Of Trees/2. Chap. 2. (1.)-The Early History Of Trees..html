<div2 type="chapter" n="2" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 2. (1.)—THE EARLY HISTORY OF TREES.</head><p>The trees formed the first temples of the gods, and even atthe present day, the country people, preserving in all theirsimplicity their ancient rites, consecrate the finest among theirtrees to some divinity;<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> indeed, we feel ourselves inspired toadoration, not less by the sacred groves and their very stillness,than by the statues of the gods, resplendent as they are withgold and ivory. Each kind of tree remains immutably consecrated to its own peculiar divinity, the beech<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> to Jupiter,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> thelaurel to Apollo, the olive to Minerva, the myrtle to Venus,and the poplar to Hercules: besides which, it is our beliefthat the Sylvans, the Fauns, and various kinds of goddessNymphs, have the tutelage of the woods, and we look uponthose deities as especially appointed to preside over them bythe will of heaven. In more recent times, it was the treesthat by their juices, more soothing even than corn, first mollified the natural asperity of man; and it is from these that wenow derive the oil of the olive that renders the limbs so supple,the draught of wine that so efficiently recruits the strength,and the numerous delicacies which spring up spontaneously atthe various seasons of the year, and load our tables with theirviands—tables to replenish which, we engage in combat withwild beasts, and seek for the fishes which have fattened uponthe dead corpse of the shipwrecked mariner—indeed, it is onlyat the second<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> course, after all, that the produce of the treesappears.</p><p>But, in addition to this, the trees have a thousand otheruses, all of which are indispensable to the full enjoyment of<pb n="3103" />life. It is by the aid of the tree that we plough the deep, and bring near to us far distant lands; it is by the aid of the tree,too, that we construct our edifices. The statues, even, of thedeities were formed of the wood of trees, in the days when novalue had been set as yet on the dead carcase<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> of a wild beast,and when, luxury not yet deriving its sanction from thegods themselves, we had not to behold, resplendent with thesame ivory, the heads of the divinities<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> and the feet of ourtables. It is related that the Gauls, separated from us as theywere by the Alps, which then formed an almost insurmountablebulwark, had, as their chief motive for invading Italy, itsdried figs, its grapes, its oil, and its wine, samples<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> of whichhad been brought back to them by Helico, a citizen of theHelvetii, who had been staying at Rome, to practise there asan artizan. We may offer some excuse, then, for them, whenwe know that they came in quest of these various productions,though at the price even of war.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Desfontaines remarks, that we may still trace vestiges of this customin the fine trees that grow near church porches, and in church-yards.Of course, his remark will apply to France more particularly.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is doubtful whether the æsculus of the Romans was the same as thebay-oak, the holm-oak, or the beech.

Thoughall the MSS. agree in it, it is probably a corrupt reading. Plutarch, inhis Life of Camillus, says that the wine of Italy was first introduced inGaul by Aruns, the Etruscan.</p></body>
