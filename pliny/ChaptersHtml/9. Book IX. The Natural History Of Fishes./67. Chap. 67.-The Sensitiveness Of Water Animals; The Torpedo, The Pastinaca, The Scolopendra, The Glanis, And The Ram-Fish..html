<div2 type="chapter" n="67" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 67.ÑTHE SENSITIVENESS OF WATER ANIMALS; THE TORPEDO, THE PASTINACA, THE SCOLOPENDRA, THE GLANIS, AND THE RAM-FISH.</head><p>Upon<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> reflecting on such facts as these, I am the more inclined to wonder at the circumstance that some persons havebeen found who were of opinion that the water animals aredevoid of all sense. The torpedo<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> is very well aware of theextent of its own powers, and that, too, although it experiencesno benumbing effects from them itself. Lying concealed in<pb n="2452" />the mud, it awaits the approach of the fish, and, at the momentthat they are swimming above in supposed security, communicates the shock, and instantly darts upon them: there is nodelicate<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> morsel in existence that is preferred to the liverof this fish. And no less wonderful, too, is the shrewdness<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>manifested by the sea-frog,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> which is known by us as the"fisher." Stirring up the mud, it protrudes from the surfacetwo little horns, which project from beneath the eyes, and soattracts the small fish which are sporting around it, until atlast they approach so close that it is able to seize them. In asimilar manner, too, the squatina and the rhombus<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> concealthemselves, but extend their fins, which, as they move to andfro, resemble little worms; the ray also does the same. Thepastinaca,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> too, lies lurking in ambush, and pierces the fishas they pass with the sting with which it is armed. Another proof of instinctive shrewdness is the fact, that althoughthe ray is the very slowest of all the fish in its movements, itis found with the mullet in its belly, which is the swiftest ofthem all.</p><p>(43.) The scolopendra,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> which bears a strong resemblance<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span><pb n="2453" />to the land insect which we call a centipede, if it chances toswallow a hook, will vomit forth all its intestines, until it hasdisengaged itself, after which it will suck them in again. Thesea-fox<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> too, when exposed to a similar peril, goes onswallowing the line until it meets with a weak part of it,and then with its teeth snaps it asunder with the greatest ease.The fish called the glanis<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> is more cautious; it bites at thehooks from behind, and does not swallow them, but only stripsthem of the bait.</p><p>(44.) The sea-ram<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> commits its ravages just like a waryrobber; at one time it will lurk in the shadow of some largevessel that is lying out at sea, and wait for any one who maybe tempted to swim; while at another, it will raise its headfrom the surface of the water, survey the fishermen's boats,and then slily swim towards them and sink them.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The whole, nearly, of this Chapter is taken from Aristotle, B. v. c. 16.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Plutarch speaks of this fish, in his "Treatise on the Instincts of Animals;" also Oppian, Halieut. B. ii. 1. 62. The Raia torpedo of Linn¾us,Cuvier says, has on each side of the body a galvanic organ, which producesan electric shock, similar to that communicated by the use of the Leydenvial. By this means it baffles its enemies, and drives them away; or else,having stupefied them, devours them at its leisure.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier confirms this statement. The liver of the torpedo, he says, isvery delicate eating, as, indeed, is that part in most of the ray genus.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Oppian, Halieut. B. ii. 1. 86; ®lian, Hist. Anim. B. ix. c. 24; andCicero, De Nat. Deor. make mention of this.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Lophius piscatorius of Linn¾us, the baudroie of the French.This is a fish, Cuvier says, with a large wide mouth, and having upon thetop of the head moveable filaments, surmounted by a sort of membranouslashes. It seems that it is the fact that it buries itself in the sand, andthen employs the artifice here mentioned by Pliny, for the purpose of attracting the fish that serve as its food.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or turbot. This fish, the Pleuronectes maximus of Linn¾us, and theSqualus squatina of Linn¾us, presents no sufficiently distinct filaments at theextremity of the fins to justify what Pliny says. But the word "rhombus,"Cuvier says, which ordinarily means the common turbot, here means thepsetta of the Greeks, the Pleuronectes rhombus of Linn¾us, which has theanterior radii of the dorsal fin separated, and forming small filaments. Foran account of the psetta, see c. 24, p. 396.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The sting-ray, the Raia pastinaca of Linn¾us. This fish, Cuviersays, has upon the tail a pointed spine, compressed and notched like a saw,which forms a most dangerous weapon. It is again mentioned in c, 72 ofthe present Book, under its Greek name of "trigon."</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. ii. c. 17, and B. ix. c. 51; Oppian, Halieut.B. ii. 1. 424; and ®lian, Hist. Anim. B. vii. c. 35, make a similar statement as to the scolopendra.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The animal, Cuvier says, which is here mentioned as the scolopendra,is in reality of the class of worms that have red blood, or annelides, such,for instance, as the Nereides of larger size. These having on the sides tentacles, which bear a strong resemblance to feet, and sharp jaws, might, hesays, be very easily taken for scolopendr¾. They have also a fleshy trunk,often very voluminous, and so flexible that it can be extended or withdrawn,according to the necessities of the animal. It is this trunk, Cuvier thinks,that gave occasion to the story that it could disgorge its entrails, and thenswallow them again.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This fish, Cuvier says, was doubtless a species of squalus; which havethe power, in consequence of the sharpness of their saw-like teeth, of cuttinga line with the greatest ease. It is mentioned by Aristotle, B. ix. c. 52;®lian, Var. Hist. B. i. c. 43; and Oppian, Halieut. B. iii. 1. 144.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The fish that has been previously mentioned in c. 17 of this Book,under the name of silurus.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Aries."
