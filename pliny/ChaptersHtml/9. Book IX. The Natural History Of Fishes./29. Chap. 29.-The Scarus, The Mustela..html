<div2 type="chapter" n="29" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 29.—THE SCARUS, THE MUSTELA.</head><p>At the present day, the first place is given to the scarus,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> theonly fish that is said to ruminate, and to feed on grass and noton other fish. It is mostly found in the Carpathian Sea, andnever of its own accord passes Lectum,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> a promontory of Troas.Optatus Elipertius, the commander of the fleet under the Emperor Claudius, had this fish brought from that locality, anddispersed in various places off the coast between Ostia and the<pb n="2401" />districts of Campania. During five years, the greatest carewas taken that those which were caught should be returned tothe sea; but since then they have been always found in greatabundance off the shores of Italy, where formerly there werenone to be taken. Thus has gluttony introduced these fish, tobe a dainty within its reach, and added a new inhabitant tothe seas; so that we ought to feel no surprise that foreignbirds breed at Rome.</p><p>The fish that is next in estimation for the table is the mustela,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> but that is valued only for its liver. A singular thingto tell of—the lake of Brigantia,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> in Rhætia, lying in themidst of the Alps, produces them to rival even those of thesea.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier says that this fish held, as Pliny here states, the very highestplace at the Roman tables, and was especially famous: First, because itwas supposed to ruminate; in allusion to which, Ovid says, Halieut. 1. 118,"But, on the other hand, some fishes extend themselves on the sandscovered with weeds, as the scarus, which fish alone ruminates the food ithas eaten." Secondly, because, as Aristotle, B. viii. c. 2, and Ælian, B. i.c. 2, inform us, it lived solely on vegetables. Thirdly, because it had thefaculty of producing a sound, as we learn from Oppian, Halieut. B. i.1. 134, and Suidas. Fourthly, for its salacious propensities, numbers beingtaken by means of a female attached to a string, Oppian, Halieut. B. iv.1. 78, and Ælian, B. i. c. 2. Fifthly, for its remarkable sagacity in affording assistance to another, when taken in the net; relative to which Ovidhas the following curious passage, Halieut. 1. <hi rend="ital">9, et seq.</hi> "The scarus iscaught by stratagem beneath the waves, and at length dreads the baitfraught with treachery. It dares not strike the osiers with an effort of itshead; but, turning away, as it loosens the twigs with frequent blows of itstail, it makes its passage, and escapes safely into the deep. Moreover, ifperchance any kind scarus, swimming behind, sees it struggling within theosiers, he takes hold of its tail in his mouth, as it is thus turned away, andso it makes its escape." Oppian, Halieut. B. iv. 1. 40, and Ælian, Hist.Anim. B. i. c. 4, mention the same circumstance. We find that it washighly esteemed by the Roman epicures, even in early times, it being mentioned by Ennius and Horace. It was salted with the intestines in it; andMartial, B. xiii. Ep. 84, seems to speak of it as not being good to eat without them. It was a high-coloured fish, so much so, that Marcellus Sidetescalled it "floridum," while by Oppian it is called <foreign lang="greek">poiki/lon,</foreign> or "variegated."Rondelet thinks that it was one of spari or the labri, while Belon describesas such, a fish now unknown to zoologists, the tail of which, he says, hasprojecting spines. Aldrovandus calls it by the name of Scarus Cretensis, aspecies of the genus which at present goes by the name of Scarus, and whichis distinguished by osseous jaw-bones, resembling in shape the beak of aparrot. Cuvier says, that on finding from Belon that the name <foreign lang="greek">ska/ros</foreign> wasstill in use in the Ægean Sea, he ordered the various kinds of it to bebrought to Paris; upon which he found that they exactly resembled theScarus Cretensis of Aldrovandus, and he consequently has no doubt that itis essentially the same fish as the scarus of the Greeks and Romans. Fromthe resemblance above stated, it is not uncommonly called the "parrotfish;" while by some it has been thought to have resembled our char.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. v. cc. 32, 41.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or weasel-fish. Cuvier is of opinion that Hardouin is right in hisconjecture, that this is the Lote, or Gadus lota of Linnæus, which is stillcalled motelle in some of the provinces of France. Its liver, he says, is oneof the greatest delicacies that can be eaten.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The present Boden See, or Lake of Constance.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Instead of "marinis," Sillig adopts the reading "murænis," makingthem to rival the muræna even. The other, however, seems to be the pre-ferable reading.</p></body>
