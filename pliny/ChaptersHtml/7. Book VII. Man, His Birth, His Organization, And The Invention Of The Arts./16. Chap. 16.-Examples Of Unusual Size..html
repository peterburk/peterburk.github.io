The tallest man that has been seen in our times, wasone Gabbaras<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> by name, who was brought from Arabia bythe Emperor Claudius; his height was nine feet and as manyinches.<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> In the reign of Augustus, there were two persons,Posio and Secundilla by name, who were half a foot tallerthan him; their bodies have been preserved as objects of curiosity in the museum of the Sallustian family.<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span></p><p>In the reign of the same emperor, there was a man also,remarkable for his extremely diminutive stature, being onlytwo feet and a palm in height; his name was Conopas, and hewas a great pet with Julia, the grand-daughter of Augustus.There was a female also, of the same size, Andromeda by name,a freed-woman of Julia Augusta. We learn from Varro, thatManius Maximus and M. Tullius, members of our equestrianorder, were only two cubits in height; and I have myselfseen them, preserved in their coffins.<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> It is far from an unknown fact, that children are occasionally born a foot and ahalf in height, and sometimes a little more; such children,however, have finished their span of existence by the time theyare three years old.<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span><pb n="2158" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It was one of the tenets of the Stoics, that the world was to be alternately destroyed by water and by fire. The former element having laid itwaste on the occasion of the flood of Deucalion, the next great catastrophe,according to them, is to be produced by fire. Pliny has previously alludedto this opinion, B. ii. c. 110.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier remarks, that in the alluvial tracts throughout Europe, Siberia, and America, and probably also in other parts of the world, boneshave been found, which have belonged to very large animals, such aselephants, mastodons, and whales; and when discovered, the commonpeople, and sometimes even anatomists, have mistaken them for the bonesof giants. He especially mentions the case of the bones of an elephant,found near Lucerne, in the sixteenth century, and supposed by Plater tohave belonged to a man seventeen feet in height. Cuvier conceives thatno man in modern times has exceeded the height of seven feet, and eventhese cases are extremely rare; for further information he refers to his<hi rend="ital">Recherches sur les Ossemzens Fossiles.</hi> Some of the best authenticated factsof unusually tall men are in Buffon, Nat. Hist. vol. ii. p. 276, and vol. iii.p. 427.ÑB. The skeleton of O'Brien, in the Museum of the College ofSurgeons, in London, is about seven feet and a half in height.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The story of the birth of Orion is beautifully told by Ovid, Fasti,B. v. 1. 493. <hi rend="ital">et seq.</hi> He was often represented by the poets as of giganticstature, and after his death was fabled to have been placed among thestars, where he appears as a giant. It is not improbable that, like theCyclopes, Hercules, and Atlas, he may have been one of the earliest benefactors of mankind, and an assiduous improver of their condition; whencethe story of his gigantic size.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A gigantic son of Poseidon or Neptune, and Iphimedeia, one of theAlšeid¾.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We have an account of this supposed discovery of the body of Orestesin Herodotus, B. i. c. 68, and a reference to it, with some pertinent remarks, in Aulus Gellius, B. iii. c. 10.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Il. B. v. 1. 303, 4, B. xii. 1. 449: this opinion of Homer was adoptedby many of the Latin poets; for example, by Virgil, B. xii. 1. 900; by Ju-venal, Sat. xv. 1. 69, 70; and by Horace, Od. B. iii. O. 6, <hi rend="ital">sub finem.</hi></p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Columella speaks of Cicero as mentioning this Pollio, and stating thathe was a foot taller than any one else. It is most probably in Cicero's lostbook, "De Admirandis," that this mention was made of him.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hardouin supposes that this was not an individual name, but a termderived from the Hebrew, descriptive of his remarkable size.ÑB. Hesupposes also that not improbably this was the same individual that is mentioned by Tacitus, Annals, B. xii. c. 12, as Acharus, a king of the Arabians.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">According to our estimate of the Roman measures, this would correspond to about nine feet four and a half inches of our standard.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Conditorio Sallustianorum." The more general meaning attributedto the word "conditorium," is "tomb" or burial-place. We learn fromother sources that the famous "gardens of Sallust" belonged to the emperor Augustus, and it is not improbable that there was a museum there ofcuriosities, in which these remarkable skeletons were kept.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Loculis." It is not quite clear whether this word has the meaninghere of chest or coffin, or of a niche or cavity made in the wall of thetomb.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Among the objects of curiosity which were exhibited by Augustus tothe Roman people, as related by Suctonius, c. 43, was a dwarf namedLucius, who is there described; but he would appear to be a different person from any of those here mentioned.ÑB.</p></body>
