<div2 type="chapter" n="40" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 40.ÑTREES WHICH NEVER BLOSSOM. THE JUNIPER</head><p>The appearance of the blossom bespeaks the arrival of thespring and the birth anew of the year; this blossom is thevery pride and delight of the trees. Then it is that theyshow themselves quite renewed, and altogether different fromwhat they really are; then it is that they quite revel in the contest with each other which shall excel in the various huesand tints which they display. This merit has, however, beendenied to many of them; for they do not all blossom, andthere are certain sombre trees which do not participate in thisjoyous season of the year. The holm-oak, the pitch-tree, thelarch, and the pine are never bedecked with blossoms, andwith them there is no particular forerunner sent forth to announce the yearly birth of their respective fruits. The sameis the case, too, with the cultivated and the wild fig,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> whichimmediately present their fruit in place of any blossom. Uponthe fig, too, it is remarkable that there are abortive fruit to beseen which never ripen.</p><p>The juniper, also, is destitute<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> of blossom; some writers,however, distinguish two varieties of it, one of which blossomsbut bears no fruit,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> while the other has no blossom, but presents the berries immediately, which remain on the treefor so long a period as two years: this assertion, however, is<pb n="3381" />utterly fallacious, and all the junipers always present the samesombre appearance. So, too, in life, the fortunes of manymen are ever without their time of blossoming.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This statement, as also that relative to the holm oak, and other treespreviously mentioned, is quite incorrect. The blossoms of the fig-tree arevery much concealed, however, from view in the involucre of the clinanthium.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is not the fact, though the blossom of the juniper is of humblecharacter, and not easily seen. Theophrastus, B. iii. c. 6, only says thatit is a matter of doubt, what Pliny so positively affirms.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is the fact; the male tree is sterile, but it fecundates the female.</p></body>
