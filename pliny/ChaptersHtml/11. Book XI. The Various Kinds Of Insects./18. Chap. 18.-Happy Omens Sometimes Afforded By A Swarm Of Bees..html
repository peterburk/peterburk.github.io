Bees settled upon the lips ofPlato when still an infant even, announcing thereby the sweetness of that persuasive eloquence for which he was so noted.Bees settled, too, in the camp of the chieftain Drusus whenhe gained the brilliant victory at Arbalo;<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> a proof, indeed,that the conjectures of soothsayers are not by any means infallible, seeing that they are of opinion that this is always ofevil augury. When their leader is withheld from them, theswarm can always be detained; and when lost, it will disperseand take its departure to find other kings. Without a king,in fact, they cannot exist, and it is with the greatest reluctance that they put them to death when there are several; theyprefer, too, to destroy the cells of the young ones, if they findreason to despair of providing food; in such case they thenexpel the drones. And yet, with regard to the last, I find thatsome doubts are entertained; and that there are some authorswho are of opinion that they form a peculiar species, like thatbee, the very largest among them all, which is known by thename of the " thief,"<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> because it furtively devours the honey;it is distinguished by its black colour and the largeness of itsbody. It is a well-known fact, however, that the bees are inthe habit of killing the drones. These last have no king oftheir own; but how it is that they are produced without asting, is a matter still undetermined.</p><p>In a wet spring the young swarms are more numerous; ina dry one the honey is most abundant. If food happens to<pb n="3020" />fail the inhabitants of any particular hive, the swarm makesa concerted attack upon a neighbouring one, with the view ofplundering it. The swarm that is thus attacked, at onceranges itself in battle array, and if the bee-keeper shouldhappen to be present, that side which perceives itself favouredby him will refrain from attacking him. They often fight,too, for other reasons as well, and the two generals are to beseen drawing up their ranks in battle array against their op-ponents. The dispute generally arises in culling from theflowers, when each, the moment that it is in danger, summonsits companions to its aid. The battle, however, is immediatelyput an end to by throwing dust<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> among them, or raising asmoke; and if milk or honey mixed with water is placed be-fore them, they speedily become reconciled.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A place in Germany, where Drusus, the brother of Tiberius, gaineda victory over the Germans: the locality is unknown.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Fur."
