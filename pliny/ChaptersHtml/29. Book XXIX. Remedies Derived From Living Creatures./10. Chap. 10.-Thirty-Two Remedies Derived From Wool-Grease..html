Thereare numerous ways of obtaining it, but the most approvedmethod is to take the wool, fresh clipped from those parts ofthe body, or else the sweat and grease collected from any part ofthe fleece, and boil it gently in a copper vessel upon a slow fire:this done, it is left to cool, and the fat which floats upon thesurface collected into an earthen vessel. The material originallyused is then subjected to another boiling, and the two resultsare washed in cold water; after which, they are strainedthrough a linen cloth and exposed to the sun till they becomebleached and quite transparent, and are then put by in a pewter box for keeping.</p><p>The best proof of its genuineness is its retention of thestrong smell of the original grease, and its not melting whenrubbed with water upon the hand, but turning white, likewhite-lead in appearance. This substance is extremely useful for inflammations of the eyes and indurations of the eyelids. Some persons bake the wool in an earthen pot, until ithas lost all its grease, and are of opinion that, prepared thisway, it is a more useful remedy for excoriations and indurationsof the eyelids, for eruptions at the corners of the eyes, and forwatery eyes. And not only does this grease heal ulcerationsof the eyes, but, mixed with goose-grease, of the ears andgenerative organs as well; in combination also with meliloteand butter, it is a cure for inflammations of the uterus, and forexcoriations of the rectum and condylomata. The other usesto which it is applied, we shall detail on a more appropriateoccasion.</p><p>The grease, too, of the wool about the tail is made up intopills, unmixed with any substance: these pills are dried andpulverized, being an excellent application for the teeth, whenloose even, and for the gums, when attacked by spreading ulcersof a cancerous nature. Sheep's wool, too, cleaned, is appliedby itself, or with the addition of sulphur, for dull, heavy pains,and the ashes of it, burnt, are used for diseases of the generative organs: indeed, this wool is possessed of such sovereignvirtues, that it is used as a covering for medicinal applicationseven. It is also an especial remedy for the sheep itself, whenit has lost its stomach, and refuses to feed; for, upon pluckingsome wool from the tail, and then tying the tail therewith, as<pb n="5385" />tight as possible, the sheep will fall to feeding immediately. Itis said, however, that the part of the tail which lies beyondthe knot so made will quickly mortify and die.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Œsypum" is often mentioned by Ovid as a favourite cosmetic withthe Roman ladies.</p></body>
