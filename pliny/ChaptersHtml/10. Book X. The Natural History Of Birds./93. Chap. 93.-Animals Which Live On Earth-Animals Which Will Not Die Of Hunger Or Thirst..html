<div2 type="chapter" n="93" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 93.ÑANIMALS WHICH LIVE ON EARTH-ANIMALS WHICHWILL NOT DIE OF HUNGER OR THIRST.</head><p>Scorpions live on earth. Serpents, when an opportunitypresents itself, show an especial liking for wine, although inother respects they need but very little drink. These animals,also, when kept shut up, require but little aliment, hardly anyat all, in fact. The same is the case also with spiders, which atother times live by suction. Hence it is, that no venomousanimal will die of hunger or thirst; it being the fact that theyhave neither heat, blood, nor sweat; all which humours,from their natural saltness, increase the animal's voracity. Inthis class of animals all those are the most deadly, whichhave eaten some of their own kind just before they inflict thewound. The sphingium and the satyr<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> stow away food in thepouches of their cheeks, after which they will take it out pieceby piece with their hands and eat it; and thus they do for aday or an hour what the ant usually does<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> for the whole year.</p><p>(73.) The only animal with toes upon the feet that feedsupon grass is the hare, which will eat corn as well; whilethe solid-hoofed animals, and the swine among the cloven-footed ones, will eat all kinds of food, as well as roots. Toroll over and over is a peculiarity of the animals with a solidhoof. All those which have serrated teeth are carnivorous.Bears live also upon corn, leaves, grapes, fruit, bees, crabs even,and ants; wolves, as we have already<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> stated, will eat eartheven when they are famishing. Cattle grow fat by drinking;hence it is that salt agrees with them so well; the same is alsothe case with beasts of burden, although they live on corn aswell as grass; but they eat just in proportion to what theydrink. In addition to those already spoken of, among thewild animals, stags ruminate, when reared in a domesticatedstate. All animals ruminate lying in preference to standing,<pb n="2550" />and more in winter than in summer, mostly for seven monthsin the year. The Pontic mouse<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> also ruminates in a similarmanner.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">As to these monkies, see B. xviii. c. 30, and c. 80.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot"><hi rend="ital">I. e.</hi> lay by a store.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">B. viii. c. 34.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably the ermine.
