(21.)-OF THE DISTANCES OR THE STARS.</head><p>Many persons have attempted to discover the distance ofthe stars from the earth, and they have published as theresult, that the sun is nineteen times as far from the moon,as the moon herself is from the earth<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>. Pythagoras, whowas a man of a very sagacious mind, computed the distancefrom the earth to the moon to be 126,000 furlongs, thatfrom her to the sun is double this distance, and that it isthree times this distance to the twelve signs<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>; and this wasalso the opinion of our countryman, Gallus Sulpicius<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Alexandre remarks, that Pliny mentions this, not as his own opinion,but that of <hi rend="ital">many</hi> persons; for, in chap. 21, he attempts to prove mathematically, that the moon is situated at an equal distance between the sunand the earth; Lemaire, ii. 286.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Marcus remarks upon the inconsistency between the account heregiven of Pythagoras's opinion, and what is generally supposed to havebeen his theory of the planetary system, according to which the sun, andnot the earth, is placed in the centre; Enfield's Philosophy, i. 288, 289.Yet we find that Plato, and many others among the ancients, give us thesame account of Pythagoras's doctrine of the respective distances of theheavenly bodies; Ajasson, ii. 374. Plato in his Timæus, 9. p. 312–315,details the complicated arrangement which he supposes to constitute theproportionate distances of the planetary bodies.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Sulpicius has already been mentioned, in the ninth chapter of thisbook, as being the first among the Romans who gave a popularexplanation of the cause of eclipses.</p></body>
