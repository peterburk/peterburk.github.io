The anthemis,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> too, offersthe singular peculiarity that it begins to blossom at the top,while in all the other plants which flower gradually, it is atthe lower part that the blossom first makes its appearance.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably the Melilotus cœrulea of Linnæus, Fée says.
