<div2 type="chapter" n="56" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 56.ÑCHIAN EARTH; THREE REMEDIES. SELINUSIAN EARTH;THREE REMEDIES. PNIGITIS; NINE REMEDIES. AMPELITIS; FOURREMEDIES.</head><p>Among the medicinal substances, there is the white earth ofChios also, the properties of which are the same as those ofSamian earth. It is used more particularly as a cosmetic forthe skin of females; the Selinusian<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> earth being also employedfor a similar purpose. This last is of a milk-white colour,and melts very rapidly in water: dissolved in milk, it is employedfor whitening the plaster coats on walls. Pnigitis<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> isvery similar to Eretrian earth, only that it is found in largermasses, and is of a glutinous consistency. Its effects aresimilar to those produced by Cimolian<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> earth, but are not soenergetic.</p><p>Ampelitis<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> is an earth which bears a strong resemblance tobitumen. The test of its goodness is its dissolving in oil, likewax, and preserving its black colour when submitted to theaction of fire. Its properties are emollient and repercussive;for which reason, it is used in medicinal compositions, thoseknown as "calliblephara,"<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> more particularly, and in preparationsfor dyeing the hair.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It appears to be a matter of doubt whether it was found at Selinus,in Sicily, or the place of that name in Cilicia. See B. iii. c. 14, and B. v.c. 22.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Agricola is of opinion that this earth had its name from the placecalled Pnigeum, in the Libyan Mareotis. Other commentators would haveit to be derived from <foreign lang="greek">pni/gw</foreign>, "to suffocate," such being its effect if takeninternally.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See the next Chapter.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">So called from <foreign lang="greek">a)mpe/los</foreign>, a "vine;" either because it was applied tovines to kill the insects, or because its admixture with the soil was favourableto the cultivation of the vine.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Washes for beautifying the eye-brows."
