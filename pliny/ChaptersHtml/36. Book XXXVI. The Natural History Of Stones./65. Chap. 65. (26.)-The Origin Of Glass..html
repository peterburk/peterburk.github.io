(26.)—THE ORIGIN OF GLASS.</head><p>In Syria there is a region known as Phœnice,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> adjoining toJudæa, and enclosing, between the lower ridges of MountCarmelus, a marshy district known by the name of Cendebia.In this district, it is supposed, rises the river Belus,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> which,after a course of five miles, empties itself into the sea near thecolony of Ptolemaïs. The tide of this river is sluggish, andthe water unwholesome to drink, but held sacred for theobservance of certain religious ceremonials. Full of slimydeposits, and very deep, it is only at the reflux of the tidethat the river discloses its sands; which, agitated by thewaves, separate themselves from their impurities, and sobecome cleansed. It is generally thought that it is theacridity of the sea-water that has this purgative effect uponthe sand, and that without this action no use could be madeof it. The shore upon which this sand is gathered is notmore than half a mile in extent; and yet, for many ages, thiswas the only spot that afforded the material for making glass.</p><p>The story is, that a ship, laden with nitre,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> being mooredupon this spot, the merchants, while preparing their repastupon the sea-shore, finding no stones at hand for supportingtheir cauldrons, employed for the purpose some lumps of nitrewhich they had taken from the vessel. Upon its being subjected to the action of the fire, in combination with the sandof the sea-shore, they beheld transparent streams flowing forthof a liquid hitherto unknown: this, it is said, was the originof glass.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span><pb n="6380" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. v. c. 17.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. v. c. 19.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A mineral alkali, Beckmann thinks; for it could not possibly be oursaltpetre, he says.
