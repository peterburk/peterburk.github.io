Licinius Mucianus relates, that in the Red Sea therewas caught a mullet eighty<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> pounds in weight. What a price<pb n="2404" />would have been paid for it by our epicures, if it had only beenfound off the shores in the vicinity of our city!</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He may have been the son of C. Asinius Gallus, who was consul B. C.8; but he does not appear to have ever been consul himself.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The reign of the Emperor Caligula.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Juvenal, Sat. iv. 1. 15, speaks of a mullet being bought for 6000 sesterces, a thousand for every pound, and Suetonius tells us that in the reignof Tiberius three mullets were sold for 30,000 sesterces. It is in allusionto this kind of extravagance that Juvenal says, in the same Satire, that itis not unlikely that the fisherman could be bought as a slave for a smallersum than the fish itself. At the above rate, each of these mullets sold forabout £70 of our money.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier says that although the mullet of the Indian Seas is in generallarger than ours, it is never found at all approaching the weight here mentioned.</p></body>
