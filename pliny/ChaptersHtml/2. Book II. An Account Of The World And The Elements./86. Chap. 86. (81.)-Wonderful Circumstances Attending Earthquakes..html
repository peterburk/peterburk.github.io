(81.)ÑWONDERFUL CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDINGEARTHQUAKES.</head><p>Inundations of the sea take place at the same time withearthquakes<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>; the water being impregnated with the samespirit<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>, and received into the bosom of the earth whichsubsides. The greatest earthquake which has occurred inour memory was in the reign of Tiberius<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>, by which twelvecities of Asia were laid prostrate in one night. They occurredthe most frequently during the Punic war, when we hadaccounts brought to Rome of fifty-seven earthquakes in thespace of a single year. It was during this year<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> that theCarthaginians and the Romans, who were fighting at thelake Thrasimenus, were neither of them sensible of a verygreat shock during the battle<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>. Nor is it an evil merelyconsisting in the danger which is produced by the motion;it is all equal or a greater evil when it is considered as aprodigy<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>. The city of Rome never experienced a shock,which was not the forerunner of some great calamity.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See Aristotle, Meteor. ii. 8.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Eodem videlicet spiritu infusi (maris) ac terr¾ residentis sinurecept i."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">U.C. 770; A.D. <date value="17" authname="17">17</date>.
