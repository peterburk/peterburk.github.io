<div2 type="chapter" n="6" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 6. (5.)—THIRTEEN VARIETIES OF THE ACORN.</head><p>It is a well-known fact that acorns<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> at this very day constitute the wealth of many nations, and that, too, even amidthese times of peace. Sometimes, also, when there is a scarcityof corn they are dried and ground, the meal being employedfor making a kind of bread. Even to this very day, in theprovinces of Spain,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> we find the acorn introduced at table inthe second course: it is thought to be sweeter when roastedin the ashes. By the law of the Twelve Tables, there is aprovision made that it shall be lawful for a man to gather hisacorns when they have fallen upon the land of another.</p><p>The varieties of the glandiferous trees are numerous, andthey are found to differ in fruit, locality, sex, and taste; theacorn of the beech having one shape, that of the quercusanother, and that, again, of the holm-oak another. The variousspecies also, among themselves, offer a considerable number ofvarieties. In addition to this, some of these trees are of awild nature, while the fruits of others are of a less acridflavour, owing to a more careful cultivation. Then, too, thereis a difference between the varieties which grow on the mountains and those of the plains; the males differ from thefemales, and there are considerable modifications in the flavourof their fruit. That of the beech<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> is the sweetest of all; somuch so, that, according to Cornelius Alexander, the people ofthe city of Chios, when besieged, supported themselves whollyon mast. The different varieties cannot possibly be distinguished by their respective names, which vary according to<pb n="3346" />their several localities. The quercus<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and the robur<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> wesee growing everywhere, but not so with the æsculus;<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> whilea fourth kind, known as the cerrus,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> is not so much as knownthroughout the greater part of Italy. We shall distinguishthem, therefore, by their characteristic features, and whencircumstances render it necessary, shall give their Greek namesas well.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Glandes." Under this name, for which we do not appear to have anyEnglish equivalent, were included, as already mentioned, not only theacorn of the oak, but the nut or mast of the beech, and probably most ofthe hard or kernel fruits. In the present instance Pliny probably alludesonly to the fruit of the oak and the beech. Acorns are but little used asan article of food in these days. Roasted, they have been proposed as asubstitute for coffee.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The acorn of the Quercus ballota of Linnæus is probably meant, whichis still much used in the province of Salamanca, and forms an agreeablearticle of food. This acorn, Fée says, contains a considerable proportionof saccharine matter, and is better roasted in the ashes than boiled in water.It is not, however, used as a dessert, as in the time of the Romans. Theseacorns are sold at market in Andalusia in the month of October.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">So far as it goes, the kernel of the mast or beech-nut is not unpalatable; but in the English beech it is very diminutive.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The word "quercu" is frequently used as a general name for theoak; but throughout the present Book it is most employed as meaning adistinct variety of the oak, one of the larger kinds, Fée says, and answeringto the Quercus racemosa of Lamarck, the Quercus robur of Linnæus, andthe Rouvre of the French.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This also has been much employed as a general name for the oak; buthere, and in other parts of this Book, it is applied to one variety. Feethinks that it answers to the Quercus sessiliflora of Smith, sometimes alsocalled "rouvre" by the French.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Quercus æsculus of Linnæus. It is not improbable that this oakis a different tree from the "Æsculus" of Horace and Virgil, which wasperhaps either a walnut, or a variety of the beech.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It has been suggested that this is the same with the Quercus cerrus ofLinnæus, and the Quercus crinita of Lamarck, the gland of which is placedin a prickly cupule. It is rarely found in France, but is often to be metwith in Piedmont and the Apennines.</p></body>
