<div2 type="chapter" n="39" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 39. (21)—AËTITES. TAPHIUSIAN STONE. CALLIMUS.</head><p>The stone called aëtites<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> has a great reputation, in consequenceof the name which it bears. It is found in the nestsof eagles, as already mentioned in our Tenth Book.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> Thereare always two of these stones found together, they say, a malestone and a female; and without them, it is said, the variouseagles that we have described would be unable to propagate.Hence it is, too, that the young of the eagle are never morethan two in number. There are four varieties of the aëtites:that of Africa is soft and diminutive, and contains in theinterior—in its bowels as it were—a sweet, white, argillaceousearth. It is friable, and is generally thought to be of thefemale sex. The male stone, on the other hand, which is foundin Arabia, is hard, and similar to a nut-gall in appearance;or else of a reddish hue, with a hard stone in the interior. Thethird kind is a stone found in the Isle of Cyprus, and resembles<pb n="6365" />those of Africa in appearance, but is larger and flat, while theothers are of a globular form: it contains a sand within, of apleasing colour, and mixed with small stones; being so softitself as to admit of being crushed between the fingers.</p><p>The fourth variety is known as the Taphiusian aëtites, andis found near Leucas,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> at Taphiusa, a locality which lies tothe right as you sail from Ithaca towards Cape Leucas. It ismet with in the beds of rivers there, and is white and round;having another stone in the interior, the name given to whichis "callimus:" none of the varieties of aëtites have a smoothersurface than this. Attached to pregnant women or to cattle,in the skins of animals that have been sacrificed, these stonesact as a preventive of abortion, care being taken not to removethem till the moment of parturition; for otherwise procidenceof the uterus is the result. If, on the other hand, they are notremoved at the moment when parturition is about to ensue,that operation of Nature cannot be effected.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "eagle-stone." It is a Geodes, mentioned in Chapter 23 of thisBook, a globular mass of clay iron-stone. Sometimes it is hollow within,and sometimes it encloses another stone, or a little water, or some mineraldust.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Chapter 4.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. iv. c. 2.</p></body>
