<div2 type="chapter" n="6" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 6.ÑWHO FIRST PRACTISED AS A PHYSICIAN AT ROME, ANDAT WHAT PERIOD.</head><p>And, indeed, it appears to me not amiss to take the presentopportunity of reviewing some remarkable facts in the days ofour forefathers connected with this subject. Cassius Hemina,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>one of our most ancient writers, says that the first physicianthat visited Rome was Archagathus, the son of Lysanias, whocame over from Peloponnesus, in the year of the City 535, L.®milius and M. Livius being consuls. He states also, that theright of free citizenship<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> was granted him, and that he had ashop<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> provided for his practice at the public expense in theAcilian Cross-way;<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> that from his practice he received thename of "Vulnerarius;"<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> that on his arrival he was greatlywelcomed at first, but that soon afterwards, from the crueltydisplayed by him in cutting and searing his patients, he acquired the new name of "Carnifex,"<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> and brought his art andphysicians in general into considerable disrepute.</p><p>That such was the fact, we may readily understand from thewords of M. Cato, a man whose authority stands so high ofitself, that but little weight is added to it by the triumph<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>which he gained, and the Censorship which he held. I shall,therefore, give his own words in reference to this subject.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See end of B. xii.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Jus Quiritium."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Tabernam."
