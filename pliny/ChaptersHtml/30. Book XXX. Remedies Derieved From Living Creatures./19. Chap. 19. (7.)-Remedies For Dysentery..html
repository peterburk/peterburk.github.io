<div2 type="chapter" n="19" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 19. (7.)—REMEDIES FOR DYSENTERY.</head><p>Dysentery is cured by taking the broth of a leg of mutton,boiled with linseed in water; by eating old ewe-milk cheese;or by taking mutton suet boiled in astringent wine. Thislast is good, too, for the iliac passion, and for inveterate coughs.Dysentery is removed also, by taking a spotted lizard frombeyond seas, boiled down till the skin only is left, the head,feet, and intestines, being first removed. A couple of snailsalso, and an egg, are beaten up, shells and all, in both cases,and made lukewarm in a new vessel, with some salt, threecyathi of water, and two cyathi of raisin-wine or date-juice,the decoction being taken in drink. Ashes, too, of burnt snails,are very serviceable, taken in wine with a modicum of resin.</p><p>The snails without shells, which we have<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> mentioned asbeing mostly found in Africa, are remarkably useful for dysentery, five of them being burnt with half a denarius of gumacacia, and taken, in doses of two spoonfuls, in myrtle wine orany other kind of astringent wine, with an equal quantity ofwarm water. Some persons employ all kinds of African snailsindiscriminately in this manner; while others, again, make useof a similar number of African snails or broad-shelled snails,as an injection, in preference: in cases, too, where the flux isconsiderable, they add a piece of gum acacia, about the size ofa bean. For dysentery and tenesmus, the cast-off slough of asnake is boiled in a pewter vessel with oil of roses: if prepared in any other kind of vessel, it is applied with an instru-ment made of pewter. Chicken-broth is also used as a remedyfor these affections; but the broth of an old cock, stronglysalted, acts more powerfully as a purgative upon the bowels.A pullet's craw, grilled and administered with salt and oil, has<pb n="5442" />a soothing effect upon cœliac affections; but it is absolutelynecessary that neither fowl nor patient should have eatencorn<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> for some time before. Pigeons' dung, also, is grilled andtaken in drink. The flesh of a ring-dove, boiled in vinegar,is curative of dysentery and cœliac affections: and for the cureof the former, a thrush is recommended, roasted with myrtleberries; a blackbird, also; or honey, boiled, in which the beeshave died.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. xxix. c. 36.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxix. c. 36.</p></body>
