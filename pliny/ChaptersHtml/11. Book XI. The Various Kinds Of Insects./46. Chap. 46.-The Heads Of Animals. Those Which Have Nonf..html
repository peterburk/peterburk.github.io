THOSE WHICH HAVE NONF.</head><p>The head of the fish is very large in proportion to the restof the body, probably, to facilitate its diving under water.Animals of the oyster and the sponge kind have no head,which is the case, also, with most of the other kinds, whoseonly sense is that of touch. Some, again, have the headblended with the body, the crab, for instance.</p></div2></body>
