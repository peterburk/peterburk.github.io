<div2 type="chapter" n="75" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 75.ÑTHE VARIOUS FORMS OF PRECIOUS STONES.</head><p>We will now make some observations in reference to preciousstones in general, following therein the opinions thathave been expressed by various authors. Stones with a levelsurface are preferred to those which are concave or protuberanton the face. An oblong shape is the one that is most approvedof, and, next to that, the lenticular<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> form, as it is called. Afterthis, the stone with a plane surface and circular is admired,those which are angular being held in the least esteem. Thereis considerable difficulty in distinguishing genuine stones fromfalse; the more so, as there has been discovered a method oftransforming genuine stones of one kind into false stones of<pb n="6463" />another.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> Sardonyx, for example, is imitated by cementingtogether three other precious stones, in such a way that noskill can detect the fraud; a black stone being used for thepurpose, a white stone, and one of a vermilion<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> colour, eachof them, in its own way, a stone of high repute. Nay, evenmore than this, there are books in existence, the authors ofwhich I forbear to name,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> which give instructions how to staincrystal in such a way as to imitate smaragdus and other transparent stones,how to make sardonyx of sarda, and othergems in a similar manner. Indeed, there is no kind of fraudpractised, by which larger profits are made.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Lenticula."
