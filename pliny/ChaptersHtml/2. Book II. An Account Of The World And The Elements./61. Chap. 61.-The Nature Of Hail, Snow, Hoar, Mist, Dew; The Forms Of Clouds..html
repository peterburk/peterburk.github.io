<div2 type="chapter" n="61" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 61.ÑTHE NATURE OF HAIL, SNOW, HOAR, MIST,DEW; THE FORMS OF CLOUDS.</head><p>I do not find that there is any doubt entertained respecting thefollowing points. (60.) Hail is produced by frozen rain,and snow by the same fluid less firmly concreted, and hoar<pb n="1091" />by frozen dew<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>. During the winter snow falls, but not hail;hail itself falls more frequently during the day than the night,and is more quickly melted than snow. There are no mistseither in the summer or during the greatest cold of winter.There is neither dew nor hoar formed during great heat orwinds, nor unless the night be serene. Fluids are diminishedin bulk by being frozen, and, when the ice is melted, we donot obtain the same quantity of fluid as at first<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>.</p><p>(61.) The clouds are varied in their colour and figure according as the fire which they contain is in excess or is absorbedby them.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle treats at some length of dew, snow, and hail, in his Meteor. i.cap. 10, 11 &amp; 12 respectively.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">When water is frozen, its bulk is increased in consequence ofits assuming a crystalline structure. Any diminution which may befound tohave taken place in the bulk of the fluid, when thawed, must be ascribedto evaporation or to some accidental circumstance.</p></body>
