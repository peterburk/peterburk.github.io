He recommends that vats and casks<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>for keeping oil should be first seasoned with it, to preventthem from soaking up the oil; and he tells us that threshing-floors should be well rubbed with it, to keep away ants,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>and to prevent any chinks or crannies from being left.The mortar, too, of walls, he says, ought to be seasoned withit, as well as the roofs and floors of granaries; and he recommends that wardrobes should be sprinkled with amurca as apreservative against wood-worms and other noxious insects.He says, too, that all grain of the cereals should be steeped init, and speaks of it as efficacious for the cure of maladies incattle as well as trees, and as useful even for ulcerations inthe inside and upon the face of man. We learn from him, also,that thongs, all articles made of leather, sandals, and axletrees used to be anointed with boiled amurca; which wasemployed also to preserve copper vessels against verdigrease,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>and to give them a better colour; as also for the seasoning ofall utensils made of wood, as well as the earthen jars in whichdried figs were kept, or of sprigs of myrtle with the leavesand berries on, or any other articles of a similar nature: inaddition to which, he asserts that wood which has been steepedin amurca will burn without producing a stifling smoke.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span></p><p>According to M. Varro,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> an olive-tree which has beenlicked by the tongue of the she-goat, or upon which she has<pb n="3292" />browsed when it was first budding,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> is sure to be barren.Thus much in reference to the olive and the oils.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It has quite lost its ancient repute: the only use it is now put to isthe manufacture of an inferior soap.
