(13.)ÑON THE RECURRENCE OF THE ECLIPSES OFTHE SUN AND THE MOON.</head><p>It is ascertained that the eclipses complete their wholerevolution in the space of 223 months<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>, that the eclipseof the sun takes place only at the conclusion or the commencement ofa lunation, which is termed conjunction<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>,<pb n="1039" />while an eclipse of the moon takes place only when she isat the full, and is always a little farther advanced than thepreceding eclipse<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>. Now there are eclipses of both thesestars in every year, which take place below the earth, atstated days and hours; and when they are above it<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> they arenot always visible, sometimes on account of the clouds, butmore frequently, from the globe of the earth being opposedto the vault of the heavens<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>. It was discovered two hundredyears ago, by the sagacity of Hipparchus, that the moon issometimes eclipsed after an interval of five months, and thesun after an interval of seven<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>; also, that he becomes invisible,while above the horizon, twice in every thirty days,but that this is seen in different places at different times.But the most wonderful circumstance is, that while it is admitted that the moon is darkened by the shadow of the earth,this occurs at one time on its western, and at another timeon its eastern side. And farther, that although, after therising of the sun, that darkening shadow ought to be belowthe earth, yet it has once happened, that the moon has beeneclipsed in the west, while both the luminaries have been abovethe horizon<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>. And as to their both being invisible in thespace of fifteen days, this very thing happened while theVespasians were emperors, the father being consul for thethird time, and the son for the second<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>.<pb n="1040" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">According to the remarks of Marcus, it appears probable that thissol-lunar period, as it has been termed, was discovered by the Chaldeans;Ajasson, ii. 306, 307.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"coitus."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Hoc enim periodo (223 mensium) plerumque redeunt eclipses, nonmultum differentes, denis tamen gradibus zodiaci antecedentes;" Kepler,as quoted by Alexandre, in Lemaire, ii. 238.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The terms "sub terra" and "superne" are interpreted, by most of thecommentators, below and above the horizon respectively; see Marcus inAjasson, ii. 307.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"globo terr¾ obstante convexitatibus mundi." The term <hi rend="ital">convexus,</hi>as applied to the heavens, or visible firmament, simply signifies<hi rend="ital">arched;</hi>not opposed to <hi rend="ital">concave,</hi> like the English word <hi rend="ital">convex.</hi></p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This point is discussed by Ptolemy, Magn.

Brotier states, that eclipses of this description occurred on the 17th July, <date value="1590-07" authname="1590-07">1590</date>, on the 30th November, <date value="1648-11" authname="1648-11">1648</date>,and on the 16th January, <date value="1660-01" authname="1660-01">1660</date>; Lemaire, ii. 260.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is supposed to have been in the year 72 of our ¾ra, when it issaid that the sun was eclipsed, in Italy, on the 8th, and the moon on the22nd of February; see Hardouin and Alexandre, in Lemaire, ii. 261.</p></body>
