The juiceof it, in combination with rose oil, is good for the ears; andthe plant itself is taken in drink, to counteract the effects ofviolent blows.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span></p><p>A variety of this plant is the mountain cunila, similar to wildthyme in appearance, and particularly efficacious for the stings ofserpents. This plant is diuretic, and promotes the lochial discharge:it aids the digestion, too, in a marvellous degree. Bothvarieties have a tendency to sharpen the appetite, even whenpersons are troubled with indigestion, if taken fasting in drink:they are good, too, for sprains, and, taken with barley-meal, andvinegar and water, they are extremely useful for stings inflictedby wasps and insects of a similar nature.</p><p>We shall have occasion to speak of other varieties oflibanotis<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> in their appropriate places.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Satureia thymbra of Linn¾us.
