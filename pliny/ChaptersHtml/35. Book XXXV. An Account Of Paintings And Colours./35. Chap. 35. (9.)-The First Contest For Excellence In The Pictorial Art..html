(9.)ÑTHE FIRST CONTEST FOR EXCELLENCE IN THEPICTORIAL ART.</head><p>And not only this, but, during the time that Pan¾nusflourished, there were contests in the pictorial art institutedat Corinth and Delphi. On the first occasion, Pan¾nus himselfentered the lists, at the Pythian Games, with Timagorasof Chalcis, by whom he was defeated; a circumstance whichis recorded in some ancient lines by Timagoras himself, andan undoubted proof that the chroniclers are in error as to<pb n="6249" />the date of the origin of painting. After these, and yetbefore the ninetieth Olympiad, there were other celebratedpainters, Polygnotus of Thasos,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> for instance, who was thefirst to paint females in transparent drapery, and to representthe head covered with a parti-coloured head-dress. He, too,was the first to contribute many other improvements to theart of painting, opening the mouth, for example, showing theteeth, and throwing expression into the countenance, in placeof the ancient rigidity of the features.</p><p>There is a picture by this artist in the Portico<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> of Pompeius,before the Curia that was built by him; with reference towhich, there is some doubt whether the man represented witha shield is in the act of ascending or descending. He alsoembellished the Temple<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> at Delphi, and at Athens the Porticoknown as the PÏcile;<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> at which last he worked gratuitously,in conjunction with Micon,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> who received pay for his labours.Indeed Polygnotus was held in the higher esteem of the two;for the Amphictyons,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> who form the general Council of Greece,decreed that he should have his lodging furnished him at thepublic expense.</p><p>There was also another Micon, distinguished from the firstMicon by the surname of "the younger," and whose daughterTimarete<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> also practised the art of painting.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. vii. c. 57.
