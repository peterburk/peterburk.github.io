<div2 type="chapter" n="59" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 59. (59.)—WHEN BARBERS WERE FIRST EMPLOYED. <span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span></head><p>The next point upon which all nations appear to haveagreed, was the employment of barbers.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> The Romans, however, were more tardy in the adoption of their services.According to Varro, they were introduced into Italy from<pb n="2237" />Sicily, in the year of Rome 454,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> having been brought overby P. Titinius Mena: before which time the Romans did notcut the hair. The younger Africanus<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> was the first whoadopted the custom of shaving every day. The late EmperorAugustus always made use of razors.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably the earliest existing reference to the practice of shaving isin Genesis, xli. 14, where Joseph is said to have shaved and changedhis raiment, when brought from prison into the presence of Pharaoh; inthis case, we may presume that it was the head, and perhaps not the beard,which was shaven.—B.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The ancients had two methods of arranging the beard; in one it wascut close to the skin, in the other it was trimmed by means of a comb, andleft of a certain length. These two methods are alluded to by Plautus,Capt. ii. 2, 16:—B. "Now the old fellow is in the barber's shop; at thisvery instant is the other handling the razor—But whether to say that he isgoing to shave him close, or to trim him through the comb, I know not."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Varro, De Re Rus. B. ii., states this fact in almost the same words.He remarks, in continuation, that the old statues prove that there wereformerly no barbers, by the length of their beard and hair.—B.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Africanus sequens;" he was the son of Paulus Æmilius, the conqueror of Perseus, and the adopted son of Scipio Africanus. In consequence of his conquest of Carthage, he was named Africanus the Younger.His custom of shaving is alluded to by Aulus Gellius, B. iii. c. 4. Fromthe remarks of these writers, we may conclude that the Romans were notgenerally in the habit of shaving until after the age of forty.—B.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Cultus." Suetonius gives a different account of the method in whichAugustus managed his beard. After remarking upon his carelessness as tohis personal appearance, he says, that Augustus sometimes cropped, "tonderet," and sometimes shaved, "raderet," his beard. Dion. Cassius mentions the period when Augustus began to shave, the consulship of L. Marcius Censorinus and C. Calvicius Sabinus, A.U.C. 714; he was then in histwenty-fourth year.—B.</p></body>
