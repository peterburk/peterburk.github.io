<div2 type="chapter" n="43" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 43.—BITHYNIA.</head><p>And now as to the remainingplaces on this coast. On the road from Cios into the interior isPrusa<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>, in Bithynia, founded by Hannibal at the foot ofOlympus, at a distance of twenty-five miles from Nicæa, LakeAscanius<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> lying between them. We then cometo Nicæa<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>, formerly called<pb n="1494" />Olbia, and situate at the bottom of the AscanianGulf; as also a second place called Prusa<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, at the foot ofMount Hypius. Pythopolis, Parthenopolis,and Coryphanta are no longer in existence. Alongthe coast we find the rivers Æsius,Bryazon, Plataneus, Areus,Æsyros, Geodos, also called Chrysorroas<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>,and the promontory<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> upon which once stood thetown of Megarice. The gulf that hereruns inland received the name of Craspedites fromthe circumstance of that town lying, asit were, upon its skirt<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>. Astacum<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>, also,formerly stood here, from which the samegulf has received the name of the 'Astacenian': the town ofLibyssa<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> formerly stood at the spot where we nowsee nothing but the tomb of Hannibal. At thebottom of the gulf liesNicomedia<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>, a famous city of Bithynia;then comes the Promontory of Leucatas<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>, by which theAstacenian Gulf is bounded, and thirty-seven milesdistant from Nicomedia; and then, the land againapproaching the other side, the straits<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> which extend as faras the<pb n="1495" />Thracian Bosporus. Upon these are situate Chalcedon<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>,a free town, sixty-two miles from Nicomedia, formerlycalled Procerastis<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>, then Colpusa, and after that the "Cityof the Blind," from the circumstance that its foundersdid not know where to build their city, Byzantium beingonly seven stadia distant, a site which is preferable in everyrespect.</p><p>In the interior of Bithynia are the colony of Apamea<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>,the Agrippenses, the Juliopolitæ, and Bithynion<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span>; the riversSyrium, Laphias, Pharnacias, Alces, Serinis, Lilæus, Scopius,and Hieras<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span>, which separates Bithynia from Galatia. BeyondChalcedon formerly stood Chrysopolis<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span>, and then Nicopolis,of which the gulf, upon which stands the Port ofAmycus<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span>, still retains the name; then the Promontory ofNaulochum, and Estiæ<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span>, a temple of Neptune<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span>. We thencome to the Bosporus, which again separates Asia fromEurope, the distance across being half a mile; it is distanttwelve miles and a half from Chalcedon. The first entranceof this strait is eight miles and three-quarters wide, at the<pb n="1496" />place where the town of Spiropolis<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> formerly stood. The Thynioccupy the whole of the coast, the Bithyni the interior. This is thetermination of Asia, and of the 282 peoples, that are to be foundbetween the Gulf of Lycia<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span> and this spot. We havealready<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span> mentioned the length of the Hellespont and Propontisto the Thracian Bosporus as being 239 miles; from Chalcedon toSigeum, Isidorus makes the distance 322 1/2.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called Brusa. It stood on the north side of Mount Olympus, fifteen Roman miles from Cius. According to most accounts, it was built by Prusias, king of Bithynia. It is most probable that Hannibal superintended the works, while staying as a refugee at the court of Prusias.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Lake Iznik.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Its ruins are to be seen at Iznik, on the east side of the lake of that name. Its site is supposed to have been originally occupied by the town of Attæa, and afterwards by a settlement of the Bottiæans, called Ancore, or Helicore, which was destroyed by the Mysians. On this spot, shortly after the death of Alexander the Great, Antigonus built a city which he named after himself, Antigonea; but Lysimachus soon afterwards changed the name into Nicæa, in honour of his wife. Under the kings of Bithynia, it was often the royal residence, and it long disputed with Nicomedia the rank of capital of Bithynia. The modern Iznik is only a poor village, with about 100 houses. Considerable ruins of the ancient city are still in existence. Littré seems to think that there are two Nicæas meant in these passages; but it would seem that the same place is alluded to in both lines. The only thing that seems to give countenance to Littré's supposition (in which he is supported by Hardouin) is, the expression "Et Prusa <hi rend="ital">item</hi> altera."</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It has been suggested, that this is only another name for the town of Cios, previously mentioned; but it is most probable that they were distinct places, and that this was originally called Cierus, and belonged to the territory of Heraclea, but was conquered by King Prusias, who named it after himself. It stood to the north-west of the other Prusa.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or the "Golden Stream."</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Suggested by Parisot to be the modern Cape Fagma.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From the Greek <foreign lang="greek">kra/spedon,</foreign> a "skirt." </p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or Astacus, a colony originally from Megara and Athens. From Scylax it would appear that this city was also called Olbia. Its site is placed by some of the modern geographers at a spot called Ovaschik, and also Bashkele.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Called Gebiseh, according to Busbequis,—at least in his day. The modern Hereket, on the coast, has been suggested.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Its ruins now bear the name of Izmid, or Iznikmid, at the northeastern corner of the Sinus Astacenus, or Gulf of Izmid. It was the chief residence of the kings of Bithynia, and one of the most splendid cities in the world. Under the Romans it was made a colony, and was a favourite residence of Diocletian and Constantine the Great. Arrian the historian was born here.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Akrita. It is also called Akritas by Ptolemy.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Straits, or Channel of Constantinople.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Its site is supposed to have been about two miles south of the modern Scutari, and it is said that the modern Greeks call it Chalkedon, and the Turks Kadi-Kioi. Its destruction was completed by the Turks, who used its materials for the construction of the mosques and other buildings of Constantinople.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">So called, Hardouin thinks, from its being opposite to the Golden Horn, or promontory on which Byzantium was built.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or Myrlea, mentioned above in C. 40. See p. 490.</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or Bithynium, lying above Tius. Its vicinity was a good feeding country for cattle, and noted for the excellence of its cheese, as mentioned by Pliny, B. xi. <hi rend="ital">c.</hi> 42. Antinoüs, the favourite of the Emperor Adrian, was born here, as Pausanias informs us. Its site does not appear to be known.</p><p><span id="note_17"><a href="#ref_17">17. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">These rivers do not appear to have been identified by the modern geographers.</p><p><span id="note_18"><a href="#ref_18">18. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The modern Scutari occupies its site. Dionysius of Byzantimn states, that it was called Chrysopolis, either because the Persians made it the place of deposit for the gold which they levied from the cities, or else from Chryses, a son of Agamemnon and Chryseis.</p><p><span id="note_19"><a href="#ref_19">19. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A king of the Bebrycians. For some further particulars relative to this place, see B. xvi. <hi rend="ital">c.</hi> 89 of the present Book.</p><p><span id="note_20"><a href="#ref_20">20. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Situate on a promontory, which is represented by the modern Algiro, according to Hardouin and Parisot.</p><p><span id="note_21"><a href="#ref_21">21. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Other writers say that it was erected in honour of the Twelve Greater Divinities.</p><p><span id="note_22"><a href="#ref_22">22. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Called Phinopolis in most of the editions. It is very doubtful whether this passage ought not to be translated, "At a distance thence of eight miles and three-quarters is the first entrance to this strait, at the spot," &amp;c. We have, however, adopted the rendering of Holland, Ajasson, and Littré.</p><p><span id="note_23"><a href="#ref_23">23. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Mentioned in C. 28 of the present Book.</p><p><span id="note_24"><a href="#ref_24">24. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. iv. <hi rend="ital">c.</hi> 24.</p></body>
