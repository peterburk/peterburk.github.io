In the Tauricpeninsula, in the state of the Parasini, there is a kind of<pb n="1124" />earth which cures all wounds<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>. About Assos, in Troas, astone is found, by which all bodies are consumed; it is calledSarcophagus<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>. There are two mountains near the riverIndus; the nature of one is to attract iron, of the other torepel it: hence, if there be nails in the shoes, the feet cannotbe drawn off the one, or set down on the other<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>. It hasbeen noticed, that at Locris and Crotona, there has neverbeen a pestilence, nor have they ever suffered from an earthquake; in Lycia there are always forty calm days before anearthquake. In the territory of Argyripa the corn which issown never springs up. At the altars of Mucius, in thecountry of the Veii, and about Tusculum, and in the Cimmerian Forest, there are places in which things that arepushed into the ground cannot be pulled out again. Thehay which is grown in Crustuminium is noxious on the spot,but elsewhere it is wholesome<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We may conceive of a large mass of rock being so balanced upon thefine point of another rock, as to be moved by the slightest touch; but,that if it be pushed with any force, it may be thrown upon a plane surface, and will then remain immovable.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Perhaps the author may refer to some kind of earth, possessed ofabsorbent or astringent properties, like the Terra Sigillata or ArmenianBole of the old Pharmacopœias.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A <foreign lang="greek">sa\rc,</foreign> caro, and <foreign lang="greek">fa/gw,</foreign> edo We may conceive thisstone to havecontained a portion of an acrid ingredient, perhaps of an alkaline nature,which, in some degree, might produce the effect here described. It doesnot appear that the material of which the stone coffins are composed, towhich this name has been applied, the workmanship of which is so muchan object of admiration, are any of them possessed of this property.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Alexandre remarks on this statement, "Montes istæ videntur originem dedisse fabulæ quæ in Arabicis Noctibus legitur....;" Lemaire,i. 425. Fouché, indeed, observes, that there are mountains composedprincipally of natural loadstone, which might sensibly attract a shoecontaining iron nails. Ajasson, ii. 386. But I conceive that we have noevidence of the existence of the magnetic iron pyrites having ever beenfound in sufficient quantity to produce any sensible effect of the kindhere described.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We may remark generally, that of the "miracula" related in thischapter, the greatest part are entirely without foundation, and the remainder much exaggerated.</p></body>
