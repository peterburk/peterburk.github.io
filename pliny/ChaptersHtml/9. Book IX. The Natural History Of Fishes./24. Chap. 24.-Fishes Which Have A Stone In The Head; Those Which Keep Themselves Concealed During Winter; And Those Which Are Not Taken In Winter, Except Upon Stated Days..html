These bodies, however, he says, are not equally large inall kinds of fish. He says that it is found largest in the sciæna.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Perca labrax of Linnæus. Called "loup," or "wolf," onthe Mediterranean coasts of France, and "bar" on the shores of theocean.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 19, attributes to the chromis, Cuvier says, stones in the head, B. iv. c. <date value="-8" authname="--08">8</date>, an acute hearing, B. iv. c. 9, thepower of making a sort of grunting noise, and the habit of living gregariously, and depositing the eggs once a year, B. iv. c. 9; all which characteristics, he says, are found in the Sciæna umbra of the naturalists, the maigreof the French. In addition to this, Epicharmus, as quoted by Athenæus,B. vii., says that the chromis and the xiphias are, at the beginning ofspring, the very best of fish; a quality which must be admitted to belongto the maigre, for its size and its excellent flavour. However, he says,seeing that the glaucus, which Aristotle has distinguished from the chromis, has a still stronger resemblance to the maigre, and that, as Beloninforms us, the ombrine, or Sciæna cirrhosa, is still sometimes called atMarseilles the "chro," or the "chrau," and that, as Gyllius says, on thecoast of Genoa it has the name of "chro," it would not be improbablethat this is really the chromis of the Greeks, as Belon supposes.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From <foreign lang="greek">skia),</foreign> the Greek for "shadow;" which name, as Cuvier says,has been translated by the moderns by the word "ombre," or "umbra."But this name has been given at the present day to so many fish of variouskinds, from the "ombra" of the Italians and the "maigre" of the French,the Sciæna umbra of the naturalists, the ombrine or Sciæna cirrhosa ofLinnæus, to the ombre of Auvergne, the Salmo thymallus of Linnæus, andthe ombre chevalier, the Salmo umbra of Linnæus, that this synonyme doesnot aid us in discovering its identity. Aristotle says nothing relative to hissciæna, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 19, except that it has stones in the head, athing that is common to this with many other fish. Pliny, in copying thispassage, preserves the Greek name; but Ovid, Columella, and Ausoniusgive it the name of "umbra:" the one, however, described by the first twois a sea-fish, while that of Ausonius is a fresh-water fish. Varro, who citesthe name of umbra among those given to fish, adds that the species whichbears it owes its name to its peculiar colour; and as Ovid calls it "liveus,"or "livid," it may be presumed to have been of a dark colour. It is verypossible, then, that it may have been the corvus marinus, or sea-crow, theSciæna nigra of Linnæus.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or pagrus. This passage is from Aristotle, Hist. Nat. B. viii. c. 19.Cuvier says that there are several names of fish, known in the Mediteraneanat the present day, as being from the <foreign lang="greek">fa/gros</foreign> of Aristotle, such as thepagri or pageau, the fragolino, &amp;c. names of a fish of a red silvery hue, theSparus erythrinus of Linnæus, his Sparus pagrus being another species.The modern Greeks also call it <foreign lang="greek">fa/gros,</foreign> the best proof of its identity withthe phagros of Aristotle, or pager or phagrus of Pliny. This phagrus, Cuvier says, was not improbably the same as the modern pagre, as their characteristics quite agree, so far as those of the ancient phagrus are described.It is of red colour, and we find Ovid (Halieut. 1. 108,) speaking of the"rutilus pagur," and it was, according to Aristotle, 13. viii. c. 13, caughtequally out at sea and near the shore, and had stones in the head, B. viii. c.19, or, in other words, stony bodies of large size in the labyrinthine cavitiesof the ear. Oppian, Halieut. B. iii. 1. 185, says that the channe forms adelicate morsel for the pagrus, which shows that it was of considerable size;and several authors quoted by Athenæus, B. vii., give it the epithet of"great." Hicesius says, in the same place, that it resembles the erythrus,the chromis, the anthias, and other fish of very different character amongthemselves; but it is only in relation to the flesh that he makes these comparisons, so that we are unable to come to any conclusion as to the form.But we find Numenius, also quoted by Athenæus, speaking of the <foreign lang="greek">fa/gron</foreign><foreign lang="greek">lofi/hn,</foreign> the "crested phagrus," possibly in allusion to the height of theneck. The properties of its flesh are, if possible, still less characteristic. Hecesius says that it is of sweet flavour and nourishing, but rather astringent.Galen, however, says that it is hard, and difficult of digestion, when old.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hardouin says that Aristotle, B. viii. c. 20, from whom this accountis taken, does not say this of all kinds of fish, but only of those which havelarge heads.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. viii. c. 54 and 55, where he is speaking of bears and otheranimals.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier states that Pliny takes this name from Aristotle, and thatAthenæus, B. vii., says that it is synonymous with the Greek name, <foreign lang="greek">koru/</foreign>-<foreign lang="greek">fainh.</foreign> He also informs us, that modern naturalists have applied thesetwo names to the dorade of navigators, the lampuga of the Spaniards andSicilians, the Coryphæna hippurus of Linnæus, but that it is not clear thatit has been applied on sufficient grounds: as there is no trace whatever ofeither of the two ancient names on the coasts of the Mediterranean, and theancient writers have given no sufficient characteristics of the coryphæna orhippurus. It was, we learn, of excellent flavour, and in the habit ofspringing out of the water, from which, Athenæus says, it received thename of "arneutes," from <foreign lang="greek">a)rno\s,</foreign> "a lamb."</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier remarks, that Rondelet and others of the moderns havethought that this was synonymous with the crow-fish, the corb of theFrench, the Sciæna nigra of Linnæus, but that his own researches on thesubject had led him to a different conclusion. Its name was derived, hesays, from the Greek <foreign lang="greek">ko/rac,</foreign> "a crow," on account of the blackness of itscolour, as Oppian says, Halieut. B. i. 1. 133; but there were white ones aswell, which Athenæus, 13. viii., says, were the best eating, though theblack ones were the most common. Aristophanes, as quoted by Athenæus,B. viii., calls it also the fish with black gills, <foreign lang="greek">melanopte/rugon.</foreign> Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. v. c. 10, says that it was a small fish, and one ofthose that increase rapidly in growth. It was little esteemed, and wasmuch used, as we learn from Athenæus and the Geoponica, for salting, andmaking garum or fish-sauce. It was also used as a bait for the anthias orflower-fish. Strabo, B. xiii., also speaks of a river-fish of this name, asbeing found in the Nile; the flesh of which Athenæus mentions as beingremarkably good eating, and the best among the fishes of the Nile. Martial also, B. xiii. Ep. 85, calls it "princeps Niliaci macelli," the "princeof the produce of the Nile." That fish, however, Pliny says, B. xxxii. c.5, was peculiar to the Nile; and he states, B. v. c. 9, that in consequenceof finding it in a lake of Lower Mauritania, Juba pretended that the Niletook its rise in that lake. Athenæus says, B. iii., that the dwellers on theNile called it <foreign lang="greek">pe/lth,</foreign> "the buckler;" and in B. vii., that the people of Alexandria called it <foreign lang="greek">pla/tac</foreign> from its broad shape. Now, Cuvier remarks, itis well known that the best fish of the Nile at the present day is the bolty,the Labrus Niloticus of Linnæus, and the Chromis Nilotica of his own system, and this he takes to be the Coracinus albus. It is flat and compressed, and when held on the side, would appear almost circular in shape. Itscolour appears white in comparison with that of another little fish of thesame genus, the Sparus chromis of Linnæus, the Chromis castanea of Cuvier,which is of a brownish colour, and is found on the coast of France, whereit has never been held in high esteem, except for the purposes of saltingor making bait for other fish. He concludes, then, that this last was thesea coracinus, and the "bolty" of the present day that of the Nile.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier says, that it has been doubted, upon the authority of PaulusJovius, whether by this name was signified the muræna of the present day,the Muræna helena of Linnæus, or the Petromizon marinus of Linnæus,the modern lamprey. These two fishes, he says, have in common a longsmooth body, and are devoid of the symmetrical fins, and the flesh of bothis of a delicate flavour. There are, however, several other characteristicsmentioned, he says, from which it can be easily proved that in most of thepassages of Pliny, Aristotle, and Ælian, where the muræna is mentioned,it is the Muræna helena that is meant. Ovid says, Halieut. 11. 114, 115,"the muræna burning with its spots of gold"—but the lamprey has noyellow spots whatever: and in 1. 27, he speaks of it as "ferox," or "fierce,"a characteristic which also belongs to the muræna, but not to the lamprey.Ælian also states, B. x. c. 40, that the muræna defends itself with its teeth,which form a double row, and Aristotle says, B. viii. c. 2, that it lives uponflesh; while Pliny says, in c. 88 of the present Book, that it bites off thetail of the conger. It was the Muræna helena only, and not the lamprey,that could have devoured the slaves whom Vedius Pollio ordered to bethrown into their preserves, as is mentioned by our author in the presentBook, and by Seneca and Tertullian. Finally, a thing that he considersquite decisive on the point, Aristotle says, B. ii. c. 13, that the murænahas four gills on each side, like the eel; while the fact is that the lampreyhas only seven in all. Where we find Pliny speaking of the seven spotsupon the muræna found in Northern Gaul, it appears most likely, Cuviersays, that he speaks after some traveller, who had observed the sevenbranchial orifices on the lamprey, and had taken them for spots.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This fish, Cuvier says, was of a reddish colour, had rough scales,sharp teeth, large eyes, and a tough flesh. It lived a solitary life in thesea, near rocks which were the resort of shell-fish, which formed its principal nutriment. It passed the winter in the crevices of rocks under water.Its growth was rapid, and the length of its life two years; when cut inpieces, its muscles, were still seen to palpitate. Rondelet, having gatheredthese characteristics, looks upon the orphus as belonging to the genusPagrus. Cuvier says, however, that it would not be easy to prove thatthis is a warranted conclusion, and that it is not justified by tradition, asthe name has utterly disappeared from the coasts of France and Italy;though, according to Gillius and Belon, it is found among the modernGreeks, in the shape of the "ropho." Cuvier suggests that it may havebeen the Anthias sacer of Bloch, the "barbier" of the French.—It issupposed by some that it is our "gilt-head."</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Muræna conger of Linnæus.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Percæ." Cuvier says that it is most probable that he is Lere speaking of this opinion, he says, and the serran [our trumpet-fish] which bearsthis resemblance, is in many parts of Italy, at the present day, called the"Percia marina."</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Raia torpedo of Linnæus.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier states, that Athenæus, B. vii., says that the psetta was the sameas the rhombus of the Romans, the modern turbot, the Pleuronectes maximus of Linnæus. From a passage, however, of Aristotle, Hist. Anim.B. ix. c. 37, he feels convinced that it is the Pleuronectes rhombus of Linnæus, the barbue of the French, and with us the dab or sandling. Aristotle says in that passage, that it is in the habit of concealing itself in thesand, while it moves to and fro the filaments around the mouth, and soattracts the little fish. These filaments, Cuvier says, are small radii of theanterior part of the dorsal fin, which form a sort of fringe around the mouth,whence its French name of barbue. The turbot has no such filaments.</p></body>
