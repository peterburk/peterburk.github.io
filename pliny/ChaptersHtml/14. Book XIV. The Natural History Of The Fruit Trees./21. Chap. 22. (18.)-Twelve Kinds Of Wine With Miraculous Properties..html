<div2 type="chapter" n="22" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 22. (18.)—TWELVE KINDS OF WINE WITH MIRACULOUS PROPERTIES.</head><p>There are some miraculous properties, too, in certain wines.It is said that in Arcadia there is a wine grown which isproductive of fruitfulness<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> in women, and of madness in men;while in Achaia, and more especially in the vicinity of Carynia, there is a wine which causes abortion; an effect which isequally produced if a woman in a state of pregnancy happensonly to eat a grape of the vine from which it is grown, althoughin taste it is in no way different from ordinary grapes: again,it is confidently asserted that those who drink the wine ofTrœzen never bear children. Thasos, it is said, produces twovarieties of wine with quite opposite properties. By one kindsleep is produced,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> by the other it is prevented. There isalso in the same island a vine known as the "theriaca,"<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> thewine and grapes of which are a cure for the bites of serpents.The libanian vine<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> also produces a wine with the smell offrankincense, with which they make libations to the gods, while,on the other hand, the produce of that known as "aspendios,"<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>is banished from all the altars: it is said, too, that this lastvine is never touched by any bird.</p><p>The Egyptians call by the name of "Thasian,"<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> a certaingrape of that country, remarkable for its sweetness and its<pb n="3263" />laxative qualities. On the other hand, there is in Lycia acertain grape which proves astringent to the stomach whenrelaxed. Egypt has a wine, too, known as "ecbolas,"<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> whichis productive of abortion. There are some wines, which atthe rising of the Dog-star change their nature in the wine-lofts<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> where they are kept, and afterwards recover<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> theiroriginal quality. The same is the case, too, with wines whencarried across the seas: those that are able to withstand themotion of the waves, appear afterwards to be twice as old<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> asthey really are.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There is little doubt that this is fabulous: wine taken in excess, weknow, is productive of loss of the senses, frenzy in the shape of deliriumtremens.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is not unlikely; for, as Fée remarks, the red wines, containinga large proportion of alcohol, act upon the brain and promote sleep, whilethe white wines, charged with carbonic gas, are productive of wakefulness.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or healing vine.
