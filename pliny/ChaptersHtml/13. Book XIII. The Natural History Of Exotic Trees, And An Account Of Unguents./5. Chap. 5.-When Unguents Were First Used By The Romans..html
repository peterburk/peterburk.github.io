It is a well-known fact, thatwhen King Antiochus and Asia<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> were subdued, an edict waspublished in the year of the City 565, in the censorship of P.Licinius Crassus and L. Julius Cæsar, forbidding any one tosell exotics;<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> for by that name unguents were then called.But, in the name of Hercules! at the present day, there aresome persons who even go so far as to put them in their drink,and the bitterness produced thereby is prized to a high degree,in order that by their lavishness on these odours they maythus gratify the senses of two parts<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> of the body at the samemoment.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> It is a well-known historical fact, that L. Plotius,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span><pb n="3169" />the brother of L. Plancus, who was twice consul and censor,after being proscribed by the Triumvirs, was betrayed in hisplace of concealment at Salernum by the smell of his unguents, a disgrace which more than outweighed all the guilt<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>attending his proscription. For who is there that can be ofopinion that such men as this do not richly deserve to come toa violent end?</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Asia Minor more particularly.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Exotica.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The organs of taste and of smell.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We have this fact alluded to in the works of Plautus, Juvenal, Martial,and Ælian.
