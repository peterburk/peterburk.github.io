On placing a piece of itupon an iron fire-shovel at a white heat, if the metal remainsperfectly white, it is of the best quality: if again it turns of areddish colour, it is inferior; but if it becomes black, it isworthless. Fraud, however, has devised means of stultifyingthis test even; for by keeping the shovel immersed in men'surine, the piece of silver absorbs it as it burns, and so displaysa fictitious whiteness. There is also a kind of test withreference to polished silver: when the human breath comes<pb n="6126" />in contact with it, it should immediately be covered withsteam,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> the cloudiness disappearing at once.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This seems to be the meaning of "si sudet protinus."</p></body>
