<div2 type="chapter" n="2" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 2.—THE WONDERFUL FORMS OF DIFFERENT NATIONS.</head><p>We have already stated, that there are certain tribes of theScythians, and, indeed, many other nations, which feed uponhuman flesh.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> This fact itself might, perhaps, appear incredible, did we not recollect, that in the very centre of theearth, in Italy and Sicily, nations formerly existed with thesemonstrous propensities, the Cyclopes,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and the Læstrygones, forexample; and that, very recently, on the other side of the Alps,it was the custom to offer human sacrifices, after the mannerof those nations;<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and the difference is but small betweensacrificing human beings and eating them.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span></p><p>In the vicinity also of those who dwell in the northern re-<pb n="2123" />gions, and not far from the spot from which the north windarises, and the place which is called its cave,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> and is knownby the name of Geskleithron, the Arimaspi are said to exist,whom I have previously mentioned,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> a nation remarkable forhaving but one eye, and that placed in the middle of the forehead. This race is said to carry on a perpetual warfare withthe Griffins, a kind of monster, with wings, as they are commonly<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> represented, for the gold which they dig out of the mines,and which these wild beasts retain and keep watch over witha singular degree of cupidity, while the Arimaspi are equallydesirous to get possession of it.<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> Many authors have stated to<pb n="2124" />this effect, among the most illustrious of whom are Herodotusand Aristeas of Proconnesus.<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span></p><p>Beyond the other Scythian Anthropophagi, there is a countrycalled Abarimon, situate in a certain great valley of MountImaus,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> the inhabitants of which are a savage race, whosefeet are turned backwards,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> relatively to their legs: they possess wonderful velocity, and wander about indiscriminatelywith the wild beasts. We learn from Bæton, whose duty itwas to take the measurements of the routes of Alexander theGreat, that this people cannot breathe in any climate excepttheir own, for which reason it is impossible to take them before any of the neighbouring kings; nor could any of thembe brought before Alexander himself.</p><p>The Anthropophagi, whom we have previously mentioned<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>as dwelling ten days' journey beyond the Borysthenes, according to the account of Isigonus of Nicæa, were in the habit ofdrinking out of human skulls,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> and placing the scalps, withthe hair attached, upon their breasts, like so many napkins.The same author relates, that there is, in Albania, a certainrace of men, whose eyes are of a sea-green colour, and whohave white hair from their earliest childhood,<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> and that thesepeople see better in the night than in the day. He states also<pb n="2125" />that the Sauromatæ, who dwell ten days' journey beyond theBorysthenes, only take food every other day.<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span></p><p>Crates of Pergamus relates, that there formerly existed inthe vicinity of Parium, in the Hellespont, a race of men whomhe calls Ophiogenes, and that by their touch they were able tocure those who had been stung by serpents, extracting thepoison by the mere imposition of the hand.<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> Varro tells us,that there are still a few individuals in that district, whosesaliva effectually cures the stings of serpents. The same, too,was the case with the tribe of the Psylli,<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> in Africa, accordingto the account of Agatharchides; these people received theirname from Psyllus, one of their kings, whose tomb is in existence, in the district of the Greater Syrtes. In the bodies ofthese people there was by nature a certain kind of poison,which was fatal to serpents, and the odour of which overpowered them with torpor: with them it was a custom to expose children immediately after their birth to the fiercest serpents, and in this manner to make proof of the fidelity of theirwives, the serpents not being repelled by such children as werethe offspring of adultery.<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> This nation, however, was almostentirely extirpated by the slaughter made of them by the<pb n="2126" />Nasamones, who now occupy their territory.<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> This race, however, still survives in a few persons who are descendants ofthose who either took to flight or else were absent on the oc-casion of the battle. The Marsi, in Italy, are still in possessionof the same power, for which, it is said, they are indebtedto their origin from the son of Circe, from whom they acquiredit as a natural quality. But the fact is, that all men possessin their bodies a poison which acts upon serpents, and thehuman saliva, it is said, makes them take to flight, as thoughthey had been touched with boiling water. The same substance, it is said, destroys them the moment it enters theirthroat, and more particularly so, if it should happen to be thesaliva of a man who is fasting.<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span></p><p>Above the Nasamones,<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> and the Machlytæ, who border uponthem, are found, as we learn from Calliphanes, the nation ofthe Androgyni, a people who unite the two sexes in the sameindividual, and alternately perform the functions of each.Aristotle also states, that their right breast is that of a male,the left that of a female.<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span></p><p>Isigonus and Nymphodorus inform us that there are inAfrica certain families of enchanters,<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span> who, by means of theircharms, in the form of commendations, can cause cattle toperish, trees to wither, and infants to die. Isigonus adds, that<pb n="2127" />there are among the Triballi and the Illyrii, some persons ofthis description, who also have the power of fascination withthe eyes, and can even kill those on whom they fix their gazefor any length of time, more especially if their look denotesanger; the age of puberty is said to be particularly obnoxiousto the malign influence of such persons.<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span></p><p>A still more remarkable circumstance is, the fact that thesepersons have two pupils in each eye.<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span> Apollonides says, thatthere are certain females of this description in Scythia, whoare known as Bythiæ, and Phylarchus states that a tribe of theThibii in Pontus, and many other persons as well, have adouble pupil in one eye, and in the other the figure of a horse.<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span>He also remarks, that the bodies of these persons will not sinkin water,<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span> even though weighed down by their garments.<pb n="2128" />Damon gives an account of a race of people, not very muchunlike them, the Pharnaces of Æthiopia, whose perspirationis productive of consumption<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span> to the body of every person thatit touches. Cicero also, one of our own writers, makes the remark, that the glances of all women who have a double pupilis noxious.<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span></p><p>To this extent, then, has nature, when she produced in man,in common with the wild beasts, a taste for human flesh,thought fit to produce poisons as well in every part of hisbody, and in the eyes even of some persons, taking care thatthere should be no evil influence in existence, which was notto be found in the human body. Not far from the city ofRome, in the territory of the Falisci, a few families are found,who are known by the name of Hirpi. These people performa yearly sacrifice to Apollo, on Mount Soracte, on which occasion they walk over a burning pile of wood, without beingscorched even. On this account, by virtue of a decree of thesenate, they are always exempted from military service, andfrom all other public duties.<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span></p><p>Some individuals, again, are born with certain parts of thebody endowed with properties of a marvellous nature. Suchwas the case with King Pyrrhus, the great toe of whose rightfoot cured diseases of the spleen, merely by touching the patient.<span id="ref_31"><a href="#note_31">[31]</a></span> We are also informed, that this toe could not be re-<pb n="2129" />duced to ashes together with the other portions of his body;upon which it was placed in a coffer, and preserved in atemple.</p><p>India, and the region of Æthiopia more especially, aboundsin wonders.<span id="ref_32"><a href="#note_32">[32]</a></span> In India the largest of animals are produced;their dogs,<span id="ref_33"><a href="#note_33">[33]</a></span> for example, are much bigger than those of anyother country.<span id="ref_34"><a href="#note_34">[34]</a></span> The trees, too, are said to be of such vastheight, that it is impossible to send an arrow over them. Thisis the result of the singular fertility of the soil, the equabletemperature of the atmosphere, and the abundance of water;which, if we are to believe what is said, are such, that a singlefig-tree<span id="ref_35"><a href="#note_35">[35]</a></span> is capable of affording shelter to a whole troop ofhorse. The reeds here are also of such enormous length, thateach portion of them, between the joints, forms a tube, ofwhich a boat is made that is capable of holding three men.<span id="ref_36"><a href="#note_36">[36]</a></span>It is a well-known fact, that many of the people here are morethan five cubits in height.<span id="ref_37"><a href="#note_37">[37]</a></span> These people never expectorate,are subject to no pains, either in the head, the teeth, or theeyes, and rarely in any other parts of the body; so well is theheat of the sun calculated to strengthen the constitution.Their philosophers, who are called Gymnosophists, remain inone posture, with their eyes immovably fixed upon the sun,from its rising to its setting, and, during the whole of the day,they are accustomed to stand in the burning sands on onefoot, first one and then the other.<span id="ref_38"><a href="#note_38">[38]</a></span> According to the ac-<pb n="2130" />count of Megasthenes, dwelling upon a mountain called Nulo,there is a race of men who have their feet turned backwards,<span id="ref_39"><a href="#note_39">[39]</a></span>with eight toes on each foot.<span id="ref_40"><a href="#note_40">[40]</a></span></p><p>On many of the mountains again, there is a tribe of menwho have the heads of dogs,<span id="ref_41"><a href="#note_41">[41]</a></span> and clothe themselves withthe skins of wild beasts. Instead of speaking, they bark; and,furnished with claws, they live by hunting and catching birds.According to the story, as given by Ctesias, the number of thesepeople is more than a hundred and twenty thousand: and thesame author tells us, that there is a certain race in India, ofwhich the females are pregnant once only in the course of theirlives, and that the hair of the children becomes white the instant they are born. He speaks also of another race of men,who are known as Monocoli,<span id="ref_42"><a href="#note_42">[42]</a></span> who have only one leg, but areable to leap with surprising agility.<span id="ref_43"><a href="#note_43">[43]</a></span> The same people arealso called Sciapodæ,:<span id="ref_44"><a href="#note_44">[44]</a></span> because they are in the habit of lyingon their backs, during the time of the extreme heat, and protectthemselves from the sun by the shade of their feet. Thesepeople, he says, dwell not very far from the Troglodytæ;<span id="ref_45"><a href="#note_45">[45]</a></span> tothe west of whom again there is a tribe who are withoutnecks, and have eyes in their shoulders.,<span id="ref_46"><a href="#note_46">[46]</a></span><pb n="2131" /></p><p>Among the mountainous districts of the eastern parts ofIndia, in what is called the country of the Catharcludi, wefind the Satyr,<span id="ref_47"><a href="#note_47">[47]</a></span> an animal of extraordinary swiftness. Thesego sometimes on four feet, and sometimes walk erect; theyhave also the features of a human being. On account of theirswiftness, these creatures are never to be caught, except whenthey are either aged or sickly. Tauron gives the name ofChoromandæ to a nation which dwell in the woods and haveno proper voice. These people screech in a frightful manner;their bodies are covered with hair, their eyes are of a sea-greencolour, and their teeth like those of the dog.<span id="ref_48"><a href="#note_48">[48]</a></span> Eudoxus tellsus, that in the southern parts of India, the men have feet acubit in length; while those of the women are so remarkablysmall, that they are called Struthopodes.<span id="ref_49"><a href="#note_49">[49]</a></span></p><p>Megasthenes places among the Nomades<span id="ref_50"><a href="#note_50">[50]</a></span> of India, a peoplewho are called Scyritæ. These have merely holes in theirfaces instead of nostrils, and flexible feet, like the body ofthe serpent. At the very extremity of India, on the easternside, near the source of the river Ganges, there is the nationof the Astomi, a people who have no mouths; their bodiesare rough and hairy, and they cover themselves with a down<span id="ref_51"><a href="#note_51">[51]</a></span>plucked from the leaves of trees. These people subsist onlyby breathing and by the odours which they inhale through the<pb n="2132" />nostrils. They support themselves upon neither meat nordrink; when they go upon a long journey they only carry withthem various odoriferous roots and flowers, and wild apples,<span id="ref_52"><a href="#note_52">[52]</a></span>that they may not be without something to smell at. But anodour, which is a little more powerful than usual, easily destroys them.<span id="ref_53"><a href="#note_53">[53]</a></span></p><p>Beyond these people, and at the very extremity of the mountains, the Trispithami<span id="ref_54"><a href="#note_54">[54]</a></span> and the Pygmies are said to exist; tworaces which are but three spans in height, that is to say, twenty-seven inches only. They enjoy a salubrious atmosphere, and aperpetual spring, being sheltered by the mountains from thenorthern blasts; it is these people that Homer<span id="ref_55"><a href="#note_55">[55]</a></span> has mentionedas being waged war upon by cranes. It is said, that they arein the habit of going down every spring to the sea-shore, in a largebody, seated on the backs of rams and goats, and armed witharrows, and there destroy the eggs and the young of thosebirds; that this expedition occupies them for the space of threemonths, and that otherwise it would be impossible for them towithstand the increasing multitudes of the cranes. Theircabins, it is said, are built of mud, mixed with feathers andegg-shells. Aristotle, indeed, says, that they dwell in caves;but, in all other respects, he gives the same details as otherwriters.<span id="ref_56"><a href="#note_56">[56]</a></span></p><p>Isigonus informs us, that the Cyrni, a people of India, liveto their four hundredth year; and he is of opinion that thesame is the case also with the Æthiopian Macrobii,<span id="ref_57"><a href="#note_57">[57]</a></span> the Seræ,and the inhabitants of Mount Athos.<span id="ref_58"><a href="#note_58">[58]</a></span> In the case of these<pb n="2133" />last, it is supposed to be owing to the flesh of vipers, whichthey use as food;<span id="ref_59"><a href="#note_59">[59]</a></span> in consequence of which, they are free alsofrom all noxious animals, both in their hair and their garments.</p><p>According to Onesicritus, in those parts of India where thereis no shadow,<span id="ref_60"><a href="#note_60">[60]</a></span> the bodies of men attain a height of five cubitsand two palms,<span id="ref_61"><a href="#note_61">[61]</a></span> and their life is prolonged to one hundred andthirty years; they die without any symptoms of old age, andjust as if they were in the middle period of life. Crates ofPergamus calls the Indians, whose age exceeds one hundredyears, by the name of Gymnetæ;<span id="ref_62"><a href="#note_62">[62]</a></span> but not a few authors stylethem Macrobii. Ctesias mentions a tribe of them, known bythe name of Pandore, whose locality is in the valleys, and wholive to their two hundredth year; their hair is white in youth,and becomes black in old age.<span id="ref_63"><a href="#note_63">[63]</a></span> On the other hand, there aresome people joining up to the country of the Macrobii, whonever live beyond their fortieth year, and their females havechildren once only during their lives. This circumstance isalso mentioned by Agatharchides, who states, in addition, thatthey live<span id="ref_64"><a href="#note_64">[64]</a></span> on locusts,<span id="ref_65"><a href="#note_65">[65]</a></span> and are very swift of foot. Clitarchusand Megasthenes give these people the name of Mandi, andenumerate as many as three hundred villages which belong tothem. Their women are capable of bearing children in theseventh year of their age, and become old at forty.<span id="ref_66"><a href="#note_66">[66]</a></span><pb n="2134" /></p><p>Artemidorus states that in the island of Taprobane,<span id="ref_67"><a href="#note_67">[67]</a></span> life isprolonged to an extreme length, while, at the same time, thebody is exempt from weakness. According to Durisis, some ofthe Indians have connection with beasts, and from this uniona mixture of half man, half beast, is produced.<span id="ref_68"><a href="#note_68">[68]</a></span> Among theCalingæ, a nation also of India, the women conceive at fiveyears of age, and do not live beyond their eighth year.<span id="ref_69"><a href="#note_69">[69]</a></span> Inother places again, there are men born with long hairy tails,<span id="ref_70"><a href="#note_70">[70]</a></span>and of remarkable swiftness of foot; while there are others thathave ears so large as to cover the whole body.<span id="ref_71"><a href="#note_71">[71]</a></span></p><p>The Oritæ are divided from the Indians by the riverArabis;<span id="ref_72"><a href="#note_72">[72]</a></span> they are acquainted with no food whatever exceptfish, which they are in the habit of tearing to pieces with theirnails, and drying in the sun.<span id="ref_73"><a href="#note_73">[73]</a></span> Crates of Pergamus states, thatthe Troglodytæ, who dwell beyond Æthiopia, are able to outrun the horse; and that a tribe of the Æthiopians, who areknown as the Syrbotæ, exceed eight cubits in height.</p><p>There is a tribe of Æthiopian Nomades dwelling on thebanks of the river Astragus, towards the north, and about<pb n="2135" />twenty days' journey from the ocean. These people are calledMenismini; they live on the milk of the animal which we callcynocephalus,<span id="ref_74"><a href="#note_74">[74]</a></span> and rear large flocks of these creatures, takingcare to kill the males, except such as they may preserve for thepurpose of breeding. In the deserts of Africa, men are frequently seen to all appearance, and then vanish in an instant.<span id="ref_75"><a href="#note_75">[75]</a></span>Nature, in her ingenuity, has created all these marvels in thehuman race, with others of a similar nature, as so many amusements to herself, though they appear miraculous to us. Butwho is there that can enumerate all the things that she bringsto pass each day, I may almost say each hour? As a strikingevidence of her power, let it be sufficient for me to have citedwhole nations in the list of her prodigies.Let us now proceed to mention some other particulars con-nected with Man, the truth of which is universally admitted.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny has previously denominated the Scythians "Anthropophagi;"and in B. iv. c. 26, and B. vi. c. 20, he employs the word as the propername of one of the Scythian tribes.—B.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. iii. c. 9.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxxvi. c. 5.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There can be no doubt, that cannibalism has existed at all times,and that it now exists in some of the Asiatic and Polynesian islands; butwe must differ from Pliny in his opinion respecting the near connectionbetween human sacrifices and cannibalism; the first was strictly a religiousrite, the other was the result of very different causes; perhaps, in somecases, the want of food; but, in most instances, a much less pardonablemotive.—B, Still, however, if nations go so far as to sacrifice humanbeings, there is an equal chance that a religious impulse may prompt themto taste the flesh; and when once this has been done, there is no tellinghow soon it may be repeated, and that too for the gratification of the palate.According to Macrobius, human sacrifices were offered at Rome, down tothe time of Brutus, who, on the establishment of the Republic, abolishedthem. We read, however, in other authorities, that in 116, B.C. , two Gauls,a male and a female, were sacrificed by the priests in one of the streetsof Rome, shortly after which such practices were forbidden by the senate,except in those cases in which they had been ordered by the Sibyllinebooks. Still we read, in the time of Augustus, of one hundred knightsbeing sacrificed by his orders, at Perusia, and of a similar immolation inthe time of the emperor Aurelian, A.D. <date value="270" authname="270">270</date>. These, however, were all exceptional cases, and do not imply a custom of offering human sacrifices.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny, in describing the Riphæan mountains, B. iv. c. 26, calls them"gelida Aquilonis conceptacula," "the cold asylum of the northernblasts;" but we do not find the cavern mentioned in this or any other passage.The name here employed has been supposed to be derived from the Greekwords,<foreign lang="greek">ghs kleiqron,</foreign> signifying the limit or boundary of the earth.—B."Specuque ejus dicto," most probably means "the place called its cave,"and not the "cave which I have described," as Dr. B. seems to havethought.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">They are merely enumerated among other tribes of Scythians, inhabiting the country beyond the Palus Mæotis.

In the East, where there were nosafe places of deposit for money, it was the custom to bury it in the earth;hence, for the purpose of scaring depredators, the story was carefully circulated that hidden treasures were guarded by serpents and dragons.There can be little doubt that these stories, on arriving in the westernworld, combined with the knowledge of the existence of gold in the Uralian chain and other mountains of the East, gave rise to the stories of theGriffins and the Arimaspi. It has been suggested that the Arimaspi wereno other than the modern Tsheremis, who dwelt on the left bank of theMiddle Volga, in the governments of Kasan, Simbirsk, and Saratov, not farfrom the gold districts of the Uralian range.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It has been conjectured, that these fabulous tales of the combats ofthe Arimaspi with the Griffins, were invented by the neighbouring tribesof the Issedonæ or Essedones, who were anxious to throw a mystery overthe origin of the gold, that they might preserve the traffic in their ownhands. The Altai Mountains, in the north of Asia, contain many goldmines, which are still worked, as well as traces of former workings. Therepresentation of an animal, somewhat similar to the Griffin, has beenfound among the sculptures of Persepolis, and is conceived to have hadsome allegorical allusion to the religion of the ancient inhabitants ofthe place. Ælian, Hist. Anim. B. iv. c. 27, gives an account of theGriffin, and its contests with the Indians, for the gold, similar to thathere given.—B.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We have an account of the Arimaspi, and of Aristeas, in Herodotus, B. iv. cc. 13, 15, and 27.

Wehave some valuable remarks by Cuvier, on the account given by Pliny ofthe Arimaspi and the Griffins, and on the source from which it appearsto have originated, in Lemaire, vol. iii. p. 16, and Ajasson, vol. vi. pp. 164,165.—B.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The modern Himalaya range.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aulus Gellius relates this, among other wonderful tales, which arecontained in his Chapter "On the Miraculous Wonders of BarbarousNations," B. ix. c. 4.

Someof the feats which were performed by the magicians in the court of Pharaoh, seem still to be practised in Egypt; by pressing upon the upper partof the spine, the animal is rendered rigid, while on removing the pressure,the animal is restored to its original state. These jugglers were also in thehabit, much to the surprise of the ignorant spectators, of sucking thepoison from the wounds produced by the bite of the serpent, which theyaccompanied by various ceremonies and incantations: but it is a well-known fact, that this may be done with perfect safety, in reference to poisonsof all kinds, provided there be no breach in the cuticle of the mouth orlips.—B.</p><p><span id="note_17"><a href="#ref_17">17. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxviii. c. 7.
