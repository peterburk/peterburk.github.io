They are almost all of them seen towardsthe north<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>, not indeed in any particular portion of it, but<pb n="1057" />generally in that white part of it which has obtained thename of the Milky Way. Aristotle informs us that severalof them are to be seen at the same time<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>, but this, as far asI know, has not been observed by any one else; also thatthey prognosticate high winds and great heat<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>. They arealso visible in the winter months, and about the south pole,but they have no rays proceeding from them. There was adreadful one observed by the ®thiopians and the Egyptians,to which Typhon, a king of that period, gave his own name;it had a fiery appearance, and was twisted like a spiral; itsaspect was hideous, nor was it like a star, but rather like aknot of fire<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>. Sometimes there are hairs attached to theplanets and the other stars. Comets are never seen in thewestern part of the heavens. It is generally regarded as aterrific star, and one not easily expiated; as was the case withthe civil commotions in the consulship of Octavius, and alsoin the war of Pompey and C¾sar<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>. And in our own age,about the time when Claudius C¾sar was poisoned andleft the Empire to Domitius Nero, and afterwards, while thelatter was Emperor<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>, there was one which was almost constantly seenand was very frightful. It is thought importantto notice towards what part it darts its beams, or from whatstar it receives its influence, what it resembles, and in whatplaces it shines. If it resembles a flute, it portends some-<pb n="1058" />thing unfavourable respecting music; if it appears in theparts of the signs referred to the secret members, somethingrespecting lewdness of manners; something respecting witand learning, if they form a triangular or quadrangularfigure with the position of some of the fixed stars; and thatsome one will be poisoned, if they appear in the head of eitherthe northern or the southern serpent.</p><p>Rome is the only place in the whole world where there isa temple dedicated to a comet; it was thought by the lateEmperor Augustus to be auspicious to him, from its appearing during the games which he was celebrating in honour ofVenus Genetrix, not long after the death of his father C¾sar,in the College which was founded by him<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>. He expressedhis joy in these terms: "During the very time of these gamesof mine, a hairy star was seen during seven days, in the partof the heavens which is under the Great Bear. It rose aboutthe eleventh hour of the day<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>, was very bright, and was conspicuousin all parts of the earth. The common people supposed the star toindicate, that the soul of C¾sar was admittedamong the immortal Gods; under which designation it wasthat the star was placed on the bust which was lately consecrated inthe forum<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>." This is what he proclaimed in public,but, in secret, he rejoiced at this auspicious omen, interpretingit as produced for himself; and, to confess the truth, it reallyproved a salutary omen for the world at large<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>.</p><p>Some persons suppose that these stars are permanent, andthat they move through their proper orbits, but that they areonly visible when they recede from the sun. Others supposethat they are produced by an accidental vapour togetherwith the force of fire, and that, from this circumstance, theyare liable to be dissipated<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>.<pb n="1059" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"errantium modo;" this may mean, that they move in orbits likethose of the planets and exhibit the same ph¾nomena, or simply thatthey change their situation with respect to the fixed stars.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Seneca remarks on this point, "Placet igitur nostris (Stoicis) cometas....denso a‘ri creari.

In reference tothe existence of a comet about the time of Julius C¾sar, Playfair remarks,that Halley supposed the great comet of <date value="1680" authname="1680">1680</date> to have been the same thatappeared in the year 44 A.C., and again in Justinian's time, 521 P.C., andalso in <date value="1106" authname="1106">1106</date>; Elem.
