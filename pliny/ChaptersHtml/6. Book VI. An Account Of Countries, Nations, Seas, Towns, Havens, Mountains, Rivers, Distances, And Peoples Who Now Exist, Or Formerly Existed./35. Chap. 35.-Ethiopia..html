The Roman arms also penetratedinto these regions in the time of the late Emperor Augustus,under the command of P. Petronius,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> a man of Equestrian rank, and prefect of Egypt. That general took thefollowing cities, the only ones we now find mentioned there,in the following order; Pselcis,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> Primis, Abuncis, Phthuris,Cambusis, Atteva, and Stadasis, where the river Nile, asit thunders down the precipices, has quite deprived the in-habitants of the power of hearing: he also sacked the townof Napata.<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> The extreme distance to which he penetratedbeyond Syene was nine hundred and seventy miles; but still.it was not the Roman arms that rendered these regions adesert. Æthiopia, in its turn gaining the mastery, and thenagain reduced to servitude, was at last worn out by its con-tinual wars with Egypt, having been a famous and powerfulcountry even at the time of the Trojan war, when Memnon<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>was its king; it is also very evident from the fabulous storiesabout Andromeda,<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> that it ruled over Syria in the time ofking Cepheus, and that its sway extended as far as the shoresof our sea.</p><p>In a similar manner, also, there have been conflictingaccounts as to the extent of this country: first by Dalion,<pb n="2100" />who travelled a considerable distance beyond Meroë, and afterhim by Aristocreon and Basilis, as well as the younger Simonides, who made a stay of five years at Meroë,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> when hewrote his account of Æthiopia. Timosthenes, however, thecommander of the fleets of Philadelphus, without giving anyother estimate as to the distance, says that Meroë is sixtydays' journey from Syene; while Eratosthenes states that thedistance is six hundred and twenty-five miles, and Artemidorus six hundred. Sebosus says that from the extreme pointof Egypt, the distance to Meroë is sixteen hundred andseventy-five miles, while the other writers last mentionedmake it twelve hundred and fifty. All these differences, however, have since been settled; for the persons sent by Nerofor the purposes of discovery have reported that the distancefrom Syene to Meroë is eight hundred and seventy-onemiles, the following being the items. From Syene to HieraSycaminos<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> they make to be fifty-four miles, from thenceto Tama seventy-two, to the country of the Evonymitæ,<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>the first region of Æthiopia, one hundred and twenty, toAcina fifty-four, to Pittara twenty-five, and to Tergedusone hundred and six. They state also that the island ofGagaudes lies at an equal distance from Syene and Meroë,and that it is at this place that the bird called the parrot wasfirst seen; while at another island called Articula, the animalknown as the sphingium<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> was first discovered by them, andafter passing Tergedus, the cynocephalus.<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> The distance fromthence to Napata is eighty miles, that little town being theonly one of all of them that now survives. From thence tothe island of Meroë the distance is three hundred and sixtymiles. They also state that the grass in the vicinity of Meroëbecomes of a greener and fresher colour, and that there is someslight appearance of forests, as also traces of the rhinoceros andelephant. They reported also that the city of Meroë standsat a distance of seventy miles from the first entrance of theisland of Meroë, and that close to it is another island, Taduby name, which forms a harbour facing those who enter the<pb n="2101" />right hand channel of the river. The buildings in the city,they said, were but few in number, and they stated that afemale, whose name was Candace, ruled over the district,that name having passed from queen to queen for manyyears. They related also that there was a temple of JupiterHammon there, held in great veneration, besides smallershrines erected in honour of him throughout all the country.In addition to these particulars, they were informed that inthe days of the Æthiopian dominion, the island of Meroeenjoyed great renown, and that, according to tradition, itwas in the habit of maintaining two hundred thousand armedmen, and four thousand artisans. The kings of Æthiopiaare said even at the present day to be forty-five in number.</p><p>(30.) The whole of this country has successively had thenames of Ætheria,<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> Atlantia, and last of all, Æthiopia, fromÆthiops, the son of Vulcan. It is not at all surprising thattowards the extremity of this region the men and animalsassume a monstrous form, when we consider the changeableness and volubility of fire, the heat of which is thegreat agent in imparting various forms and shapes to bodies.Indeed, it is reported that in the interior, on the easternside, there is a people that have no noses, the whole facepresenting a plane surface; that others again are destitute ofthe upper lip, and others are without tongues. Others again,have the mouth grown together, and being destitute of nostrils,breathe through one passage only, imbibing their drinkthrough it by means of the hollow stalk of the oat, whichthere grows spontaneously and supplies them with its grainfor food. Some of these nations have to employ gesturesby nodding the head and moving the limbs, instead of speech.Others again were unacquainted with the use of fire before the time of Ptolemy Lathyrus, king of Egypt. Somewriters have also stated that there is a nation of Pygmies,which dwells among the marshes in which the river Nile takesits rise; while on the coast of, Æthiopia, where we paused,<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span><pb n="2102" />there is a range of mountains, of a red colour, which have theappearance of being always burning.</p><p>All the country, after we pass Meroë, is bounded by theTroglodytæ and the Red Sea, it being three days' journey fromNapata to the shores of that sea; throughout the whole ofthis district the rain water is carefully preserved at severalplaces, while the country that lies between is extremely productive of gold. The parts beyond this are inhabited by theAdabuli, a nation of Æthiopia; and here, over against Meroë,are the Megabarri,<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> by some writers called the Adiabari; theyoccupy the city of Apollo; some of them, however, are Nomades, living on the flesh of elephants. Opposite to them, onthe African side, dwell the Macrobii,<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> and then again, beyondthe Megabarri, there are the Memnones and the Dabeli, and, ata distance of twenty days' journey, the Critensi. Beyond theseare the Dochi, and then the Gymnetes, who always go naked;and after them the Andetæ, the Mothitæ, the Mesaches, andthe Ipsodoræ, who are of a black tint, but stain the body allover with a kind of red earth. On the African side again thereare the Medimni, and then a nation of Nomades, who live onthe milk of the cynocephalus, and then the Aladi and theSyrbotæ,<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> which last are said to be eight cubits in height.</p><p>Aristocreon informs us that on the Libyan side, at a distance of five days' journey from Meroë, is the town of Tolles,and then at a further distance of twelve days' journey, Esar, atown founded by the Egyptians who fled from Psammetichus;<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span> he states also that they dwelt there for a period ofthree hundred years, and that opposite, on the Arabian side,there is a town of theirs called Daron.<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span> The town, however,which he calls Esar, is by Bion called Sape, who says that thename means "the strangers:" their capital being Sembobitis,situate on an island, and a third place of theirs, Sinat in Arabia.Between the mountains and the river Nile are the Simbarri,tile Palugges, and, on the mountains themselves, the Asachæ,<pb n="2103" />who are divided into numerous peoples; they are said to bedistant five days' journey from the sea, and to procure theirsubsistence by the chase of the elephant. An island in theNile, which belongs to the Semberritæ, is governed by aqueen; beyond it are the Æthiopian Nubei,<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span> at a distance ofeight days' journey: their town is Tenupsis, situate on theNile. There are the Sesambri also, a people among whomall the quadrupeds are without ears, the very elephants even.On the African side are the Tonobari, the Ptoenphæ, a peoplewho have a dog for their king, and divine from his movements what are his commands; the Auruspi, who have atown at a considerable distance from the Nile, and then theArchisarmi, the Phaliges, the Marigerri, and the Casmari.</p><p>Bion makes mention also of some other towns situateon islands, the whole distance being twenty days' journeyfrom Sembobitis to Meroë; a town in an adjoining island, underthe queen of the Semberritæ, with another called Asara, andanother, in a second island, called Darde. The name of a thirdisland is Medoë, upon which is the town of Asel, and a fourthis called Garodes, with a town upon it of the same name. Passing thence along the banks of the Nile, are the towns of Navi,Modunda, Andatis, Secundum, Colligat, Secande, Navectabe,Cumi, Agrospi, Ægipa, Candrogari, Araba, and Summara.<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span></p><p>Beyond is the region of Sirbitum, at which the mountainsterminate,<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span> and which by some writers is said to containthe maritime Æthiopians, the Nisacæthæ, and the Nisyti, aword which signifies "men with three or four eyes,"—not that the people really have that conformation, but because they are remarkable for the unerring aim of theirarrows. On that side of the Nile which extends along theborders of the Southern Ocean beyond the Greater Syrtes,<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span>Dalion says that the people, who use rain-water only, arecalled the Cisori, and that the other nations are the Longompori,<pb n="2104" />distant five days' journey from the Œcalices, the Usibalci, theIsbeli, the Perusii, the Ballii, and the Cispii, the rest beingdeserts, and inhabited by the tribes of fable only. In a morewesterly direction are the Nigroæ, whose king has only one eye,and that in the forehead, the Agriophagi,<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span> who live principallyon the flesh of panthers and lions, the Pamphagi,<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span> who will eatanything, the Anthropophagi, who live on human flesh, the Cynamolgi,<span id="ref_31"><a href="#note_31">[31]</a></span> a people with the heads of dogs, the Artabatitæ, whohave four feet, and wander about after the manner of willbeasts; and, after them, the Hesperiæ and the Perorsi, whom wehave already spoken<span id="ref_32"><a href="#note_32">[32]</a></span> of as dwelling on the confines of Mauritania. Some tribes, too, of the Æthiopians subsist on nothingbut locusts,<span id="ref_33"><a href="#note_33">[33]</a></span> which are smoke-dried and salted as theirprovision for the year; these people do not live beyond theirfortieth year.</p><p>M. Agrippa was of opinion that the length<span id="ref_34"><a href="#note_34">[34]</a></span> of the wholecountry of the Æthiopians, including the Red Sea, was twothousand one hundred and seventy miles, and its breadth,including Upper Egypt, twelve hundred and ninety-seven.Some authors again have made the following divisions of itslength; from Meroë to Sirbitum eleven days' sail, from Sirbitum to the Dabelli fifteen days', and from them to the Æthiopian Ocean six days' journey. It is agreed by most authors,that the distance altogether, from the ocean<span id="ref_35"><a href="#note_35">[35]</a></span> to Meroë, is sixhundred and twenty-five miles, and from Meroë to Syene,that which we have already mentioned. Æthiopia lies fromsouth-east to south-west. Situate as it is, in a southernhemisphere, forests of ebony are to be seen of the brightestverdure; and in the midst of these regions there is a mountain of immense height, which overhangs the sea, and emits aperpetual flame. By the Greeks this mountain is calledTheon Ochema, <span id="ref_36"><a href="#note_36">[36]</a></span>and at a distance of four days' sail from it<pb n="2105" />is a promontory, known as Hesperu Ceras,<span id="ref_37"><a href="#note_37">[37]</a></span> upon the confinesof Africa, and close to the Hesperiæ, an Æthiopian nation.There are some writers who affirm that in these regions thereare hills of a moderate height, which afford a pleasant shadefrom the groves with which they are clad, and are the haunts ofÆgipans<span id="ref_38"><a href="#note_38">[38]</a></span> and Satyrs.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">As to Syene and the Catadupi, see B. v. c. 10.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This place was also called in later times Contrapselcis. It wassituate in the Dodecaschœnus, the part of Æthiopia immediately aboveEgypt, on an island near the eastern bank of the river, a little abovePselcis, which stood on the opposite bank. It has been suggested that thismay have been the modern island of Derar. The other places do notappear to have been identified, and, in fact, in no two of the MSS. do thenames appear to agree.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or the "Great Wall."</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Meaning, "the people who live in seventy villages."</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or western side of the Nile, between Syene and Meroë.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot"><foreign lang="greek">Upato\n,</foreign> the "supreme," or perhaps the "last."</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Dion Cassius also mentions this expedition.
