<div2 type="chapter" n="70" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 70.â€”REMEDIES FOR SPRAINS, INDURATIONS, AND BOILS.</head><p>For the cure of sprains the following applications are used;wild boars' dung or swine's dung; calves' dung; wild boars'foam, used fresh with vinegar; goats' dung, applied withhoney; and raw beef, used as a plaster. For swellings, swine'sdung is used, warmed in an earthen pot, and beaten up withoil. The best emollient for all kinds of indurations upon thebody is wolf's fat, applied topically. In the case of soreswhich are wanted to break, the most effectual plan is to applycow-dung warmed in hot ashes, or else goats' dung boiled invinegar or wine. For the cure of boils, beef-suet is appliedwith salt; but if they are attended with pain, it is melted withoil, and no salt is used. Goat-suet is employed in a similarmanner.</p></div2></body>
