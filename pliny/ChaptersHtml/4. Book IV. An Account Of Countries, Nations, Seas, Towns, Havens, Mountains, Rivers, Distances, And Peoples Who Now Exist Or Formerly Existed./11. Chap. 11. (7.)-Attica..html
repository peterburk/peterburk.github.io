The first state that presentsitself is Attica, anciently called Acte<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>. It touches theIsthmus in that part of it which is called Megaris, from thecolony of Megara<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>, lying on the opposite side to Pagæ<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>.</p><p>These two towns are situate at the spot where the Peloponnesusprojects to the greatest distance; being placed, oneon each side, upon the very shoulders of Hellas as it were.The Pagæans, as well as the people of Ægosthena<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, belongto the jurisdiction of Megara. On the coast there is theport of Schœnos<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>, the towns of Sidus<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> andCremmyon<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>, the<pb n="1289" />Scironian Rocks<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>, six miles in length, Geranea, Megara, andEleusis<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>. Œnoë<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> and Probalinthos also formerly existedhere; the ports of Piræus and Phalerum<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> are distant from theIsthmus fifty-five miles, being united to Athens, which liesin the interior, by a wall<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> five miles in length. Athens is a freecity, and needs<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> not a word more from us in its commendation; of fame it enjoys even more than enough. InAttica there are the Fountains of Cephisia<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>, Larine,Callirrhoë Enneacrunos<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>, and the mountains of Brilessus<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span>, Ægialeus, Icarius, Hymettus<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span>, Lycabettus<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span>, andthe place where Ilissus<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> stood. At the distance of forty-five miles from the Piræus is the Promontory of Sunium<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span>.There is also the Promontory of Thoricos<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span>; Potamos<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span>,<pb n="1290" />Steria<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span>, and Brauron<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span>, once towns, the borough ofRhamus<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span>, the place where Marathon<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span> stood, theThriasian<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span> plain,the town of Melite<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span>, and Oropus<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span> upon the confines ofBœotia.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From the Greek <foreign lang="greek">a)kth\,</foreign> "the sea-shore."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It still retains its ancient name.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or Pegæ. It lay on the borders of the Corinthian Gulf, being, asPliny says, the utmost point of the Peloponnesus on that side, as Megarawas on the Saronic Gulf. According to Kruse, Psato occupies its site, butaccording to Lapie, Alepochori. The former is most probably correct.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">On the Corinthian Gulf. Porto Ghermano occupies its site.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">On the Saronic Gulf, to the north of Cenchreæ.

It was the chief place on the Saronic Gulf, betweenthe Isthmus, properly so called, and Megara. Its rains are thought tobe those seen near the chapel of Saint Theodorus. It was said to havebeen the haunt of the wild boar killed by Theseus.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">So called from being the scene of the ravages of the robber Sciron.They are now called Kaki Scala.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Famous as the principal seat of the worship of the goddesses Demeterand Persephone.

It was a member of the Tetrapolis ofAttica, and Probalinthos another.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ulrichs, the best authority, places the port of Phalerum at the eastcorner of the great Phaleric Bay, in the vicinity of Tripirghi, or theThree Towers. The three harbours of the Piræus are the presentPhanari, Stratiotiki or Paschalimani, and Drako or Porto Leone.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Piræus was united to the city by two walls, called the "LongWalls," forty stadia in length. The length of the Phaleric wall wasthirty-five stadia.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is to be regretted that such was his opinion.

It was the only source of good water fordrinking purposes in Athens. This spring is still called by its ancientname. Of Larine nothing seems to be known.</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is thought to have been the ancient name of the mountainafterwards known as Pentelicus, so famous for its marble, now calledMendeli or Penteli.</p><p><span id="note_17"><a href="#ref_17">17. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The northern or Greater Hymettus is now called Telo-Vuni, thesouthern or Lesser Mavro-Vuni.</p><p><span id="note_18"><a href="#ref_18">18. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">On the N.E. of Athens, now called the Hill of Saint George.</p><p><span id="note_19"><a href="#ref_19">19. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably on the river of the same name.</p><p><span id="note_20"><a href="#ref_20">20. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Capo Colonna.</p><p><span id="note_21"><a href="#ref_21">21. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">North of Sunium and the modern bay of Panorimo.

It layon the east coast to the north of Thoricus. Its harbour was probablythe modern Dhaskalio; and the town is placed by Leake at the ruins calledPaleokastro, to the south of the village of Dardheza.</p><p><span id="note_23"><a href="#ref_23">23. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">On the east coast, between Prasiæ and Brauron.</p><p><span id="note_24"><a href="#ref_24">24. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">One of the twelve ancient cities of Cecrops, on the eastern coast.Its name is supposed to be preserved in those of the villages Vraona andPaleo Vraona.</p><p><span id="note_25"><a href="#ref_25">25. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A Demus belonging to the tribe Æantis.
