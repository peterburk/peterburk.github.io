It adheres<pb n="1139" />to every solid body which it touches, and moreover, whentouched, it follows you, if you attempt to escape from it.By means of it the people defended their walls againstLucullus, and the soldiers were burned in their armour<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>.
