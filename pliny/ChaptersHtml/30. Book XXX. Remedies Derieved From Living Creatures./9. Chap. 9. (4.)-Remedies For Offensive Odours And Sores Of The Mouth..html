(4.)â€”REMEDIES FOR OFFENSIVE ODOURS AND SORES OFTHE MOUTH.</head><p>To impart sweetness to the breath, it is recommended torub the teeth with ashes of burnt mouse-dung and honey:some persons are in the habit of mixing fennel root. To pickthe teeth with a vulture' s feather, is productive of a sourbreath; but to use a porcupine's quill for that purpose, greatlystrengthens the teeth. Ulcers of the tongue and lips are curedby taking a decoction of swallows, boiled in honied wine; andchapped lips are healed by using goose-grease or poultry-grease,wool-grease mixed with nut-galls, white spiders' webs, or thefine cobwebs that are found adhering to the beams of roofs.If the inside of the mouth has been scalded with any hot substance, bitches' milk will afford an immediate cure.</p></div2></body>
