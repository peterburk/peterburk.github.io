There are still inexistence censorial<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> laws, which forbid the kernels<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> in theneck of swine to be served at table, dormice too, and otherthings too trifling to mention: and yet there has been no lawpassed, forbidding marble to be imported, or the seas to betraversed in search of it!</p><p>(2.) It may possibly be observed, that this was, becausemarble was not then introduced. Such, however, is not thefact; for in the ¾dileship of M. Scaurus,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> three hundred andsixty columns were to be seen imported; for the decorations ofa temporary theatre, too, one that was destined to be in use forbarely a single month. And yet the laws were silent thereon;in a spirit of indulgence for the amusements of the public, nodoubt. But then, why such indulgence? or how do vicesmore insidiously steal upon us than under the plea of servingthe public? By what other way, in fact, did ivory, gold, andprecious stones, first come into use with private individuals?</p><p>Can we say that there is now anything that we have reservedfor the exclusive use of the gods? However, be it so,let us admit of this indulgence for the amusements of thepublic; but still, why did the laws maintain their silence<pb n="6307" />when the largest of these columns, pillars of Lucullan<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> marble,as much as eight-and-thirty feet in height, were erected inthe atrium of Scaurus? a thing, too, that was not doneprivately or in secret; for the contractor for the public sewerscompelled him to give security for the possible damage thatmight be done in the carriage of them to the Palatium.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>When so bad an example as this was set, would it not havebeen advisable to take some precautions for the preservationof the public morals? And yet the laws still preserved theirsilence, when such enormous masses as these were being carriedpast the earthenware<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> pediments of the temples of thegods, to the house of a private individual!</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. viii. c. 82.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Glandia."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See Chapter 24 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See Chapter 8 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In the Eleventh Region of the City.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxxv. cc. 43, 45.</p></body>
