(5.)—THE NATURE OF WINES.</head><p>It is the property of wine, when drunk, to cause a Feelingof warmth in the interior of the viscera, and, when pouredupon the exterior of the body, to be cool and refreshing. Itwill not be foreign to my purpose on the present occasion tostate the advice which Androcydes, a man famous for hiswisdom, wrote to Alexander the Great, with the view of putting a check on his intemperance: "When you are about todrink wine, O king!" said he, "remember that you are aboutto drink the blood of the earth: hemlock is a poison to man,wine a poison<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> to hemlock." And if Alexander had only followed this advice, he certainly would not have had to answer<pb n="3239" />for slaying his friends<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> in his drunken fits. In fact, we mayFeel ourselves quite justified in saying that there is nothingmore useful than wine for strengthening the body, while, atthe same time, there is nothing more pernicious as a luxury,if we are not on our guard against excess.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He implies that wine is an antidote to the poisonous effects of hemlock. This is not the case, but it is said by some that vinegar is. It isthe plant hemlock (cicuta) that is meant, and not the fatal draught thatwas drunk by Socrates and Philopœmen. See further in B. xxiii. c. 23,and B. xxv. c. 95.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Clitus and Callisthenes.</p></body>
