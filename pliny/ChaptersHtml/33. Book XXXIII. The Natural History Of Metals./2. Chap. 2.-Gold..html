Man has learned how to challengeboth Nature and art to become the incitements to vice! Hisvery cups he has delighted to engrave with libidinous subjects,and he takes pleasure in drinking from vessels of obscene form!<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>But in lapse of time, the metals passed out of fashion, andmen began to make no account of them; gold and silver, infact, became too common. From this same earth we have extractedvessels of murrhine<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> and vases of crystal,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> objectsthe very fragility of which is considered to enhance their value.In fact, it has come to be looked upon as a proof of opulence,and as quite the glory of luxury, to possess that which may beirremediably destroyed in an instant. Nor was even thisenough;Ñwe now drink from out of a mass of gems,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> and weset our goblets with smaragdi;<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> we take delight in possessingthe wealth of India, as the promoter of intoxication, and goldis now nothing more than a mere accessory.<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span><pb n="6071" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Chrysocolla" is fully described in Chapter 26 of this Book.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Meaning "gold glue," or "gold solder."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There is considerable variation in the text of this passage, as found inthe different editions. In that of Dalechamps, the Variorum, and those ofDe La‘t and Sillig, the sentence concludes with the words "nomen ex aurocustodiens;" while in those of Valpy, Lemaire, Poinsinet, Ajasson, andothers, we find substituted for them the words, "Non natura," "Nomennatura," "Nomine natura," or "Nomen naturam."ÑB. The first readingis warranted by the Bamberg MS.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Auri sanies." More properly speaking, "the corrupt matter dischargedby gold." See Chapter 26.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Minium" is treated of in Chapter 36 of this Book.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Pretia rerum." The value of the raw material.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny here refers both to the art of producing figures in relief on drinkingvessels made of the precious metals, and also of giving them particularforms. A well-known line of Juvenal, Sat. ii. 1. 95, affords a strikingillustration of the depraved taste which existed in his time.ÑB. Lampridiusalso speaks of vessels of silver "defiled with representations of a mostlibidinous character;" and Capitolinus speaks of "phallovitroboli," glassdrinking vessels shaped like a phallus.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Murrhina" or "myrrhina," are described in B. xxxvii. c. 8; theywere, perhaps, onyxes or opals, though possibly the term was not strictlyconfined to these substances, but signified any transparent minerals, thatexhibited a variety of colours. Salmasius, however, ridicules the idea oftheir being onyxes, and is of opinion that these vessels were made of porcelain;Exer. Plin. p. 144.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxxvii. c. 9.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He alludes to the cups known as "chrysendeta," adorned with circletsof gold, exquisite chasings, and groups of precious stones.
