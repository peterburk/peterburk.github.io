<div2 type="chapter" n="1" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 1. (1.)—WHY THE LARGEST ANIMALS ARE FOUND IN THE SEA.</head><p>WE have now given an account of the animals which wecall terrestrial, and which live as it were in a sort of societywith man. Among the remaining ones, it is well knownthat the birds are the smallest; we shall therefore first describe those which inhabit the seas, rivers, and standingwaters.</p><p>(2.) Among these there are many to be found that exceedin size any of the terrestrial animals even; the evident causeof which is the superabundance of moisture with which theyare supplied. Very different is the lot of the winged animals,whose life is passed soaring aloft in the air. But in the seas,spread out as they are far and wide, forming an element at onceso delicate and so vivifying, and receiving the generating principles<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> from the regions of the air, as they are ever producedby Nature, many animals are to be found, and indeed, most ofthose that are of monstrous form; from the fact, no doubt, thatthese seeds and first principles of being are so utterly conglomerated and so involved, the one with the other, from beingwhirled to and fro, now by the action of the winds and nowby the waves. Hence it is that the vulgar notion may verypossibly be true, that whatever is produced in any other department of Nature, is to be found in the sea as well; while,at the same time, many other productions are there to be foundwhich nowhere else exist. That there are to be found in thesea the forms, not only of terrestrial animals, but of inanimateobjects even, is easily to be understood by all who will take the<pb n="2359" />trouble to examine the grape-fish,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> the sword-fish,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> the sawfish,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and the cucumber-fish,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> which last so strongly resemblesthe real cucumber both in colour and in smell. We shall findthe less reason then to be surprised to find that in so small anobject as a shell-fish<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> the head of the horse is to be seen protruding from the shell.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He has already said, in B. ii. c. 3, that "the seeds of all bodies falldown from the heavens, principally into the ocean, and being mixedtogether, we find that a variety of monstrous forms are in this way fre-quently produced."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hardouin has the following remark on this passage. "Rondeletand Aldrovandus only waste their time and pains in making their minuteinquiries into the present names of these fish, which took their namesfrom grapes, the wood, the saw, and the cucumber; for by no other writerdo we find them mentioned even." Cuvier, however, does not seem tobe of Hardouin's opinion, that such investigations are a waste of time, andhas suggested that the eggs of the Sepia officinalis may be alluded to, theeggs of which are in clusters of a dark colour, and bearing a strong resemblance to black grapes. This resemblance to a bunch of grapes is noticedby Pliny himself, in c. 74 of the present Book.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He alludes, most probably, to what we call the "sword-fish," the"Xiphias gladius" of Linnæus.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably, in allusion to the "Squalus pristis" of Linnæus.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier suggests that he probably alludes to the "Holothuria pentactes" of Linnæus, or the sea-priapus; and remarks, that when the animalcontracts itself, it bears a very strong resemblance to a cucumber.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier says, that he most probably alludes to the "Syngnathushippocampus" of Linnæus. This little fish, he says, is also called the seahorse, and having the body armed with a hard coat, might very easily havebeen taken for a shell-fish. Its head, in miniature, bears a very strongresemblance to that of a horse.</p></body>
