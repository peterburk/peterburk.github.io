<div2 type="chapter" n="20" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 20.ÑTHE SERES.</head><p>After we have passed the Caspian Sea and the ScythianOcean, our course takes an easterly direction, such being the<pb n="2036" />turn here taken by the line of the coast. The first portion<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>of these shores, after we pass the Scythian Promontory, istotally uninhabitable, owing to the snow, and the regions adjoining are uncultivated, in consequence of the savage stateof the nations which dwell there. Here are the abodes of theScythian Anthropophagi,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> who feed on human flesh. Henceit is that all around them consists of vast deserts, inhabited bymultitudes of wild beasts, which are continually lying in wait,ready to fall upon human beings just as savage as themselves.After leaving these, we again come to a nation of the Scythians,and then again to desert tracts tenanted by wild beasts, untilwe reach a chain of mountains which runs up to the sea, andbears the name of Tabis.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> It is not, however, before we havetraversed very nearly one half of the coast that looks towardsthe north-east, that we find it occupied by inhabitants.</p><p>The first people that are known of here are the Seres,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> sofamous for the wool that is found in their forests.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> After steeping it in water, they comb off a white down that adheres to theleaves; and then to the females of our part of the world theygive the twofold task<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> of unravelling their textures, and of weav-<pb n="2037" />ing the threads afresh. So manifold is the labour, and so distant are the regions which are thus ransacked to supply a dressthrough which our ladies may in public display<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> their charms.The Seres are of inoffensive manners, but, bearing a strong resemblance therein to all savage nations, they shun all intercourse with the rest of mankind, and await the approach<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> ofthose who wish to traffic with them. The first river that isknown in their territory is the Psitharas,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> next to that theCambari, and the third the Laros; after which we come to thePromontory of Chryse,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> the Gulf of Cynaba, the river Atianos,and the nation of the Attacori on the gulf of that name, a peopleprotected by their sunny hills from all noxious blasts, and livingin a climate of the same temperature as that of the Hyperborei. Amometus has written a work entirely devoted to thehistory of these people, just as Hecat¾us has done in his treatiseon the Hyperborei. After the Attacori, we find the nationsof the Phruri and the Tochari, and, in the interior, the Casiri,a people of India, who look toward the Scythians, and feed<pb n="2038" />on human flesh. Here are also numerous wandering Nomadtribes of India. There are some authors who state that in anorth-easterly direction these nations touch upon the Cicones<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>and the Brysari.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This would apply to the north-eastern coasts of Siberia, if Pliny hadhad any idea of land situate in such high latitudes; but, on the contrary,as already remarked, he appears to have supposed that the continent ofAsia terminated a little above the northern extremity of the Caspian. Itwould be a loss of time to guess what locality is meant by the ScythianPromontory.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "man-eaters."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This, it would appear, he looks upon as the extreme north-easternpoint of Asia. Parisot suggests that the word Tabis is allied to theMongol Daba, which signifies "mountain;" or else that it may have someaffinity with Thibet."</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The people of Serica, which country with Ptolemy corresponds to thenorth-western part of China, and the adjacent portions of Tibet and ChineseTartary. The capital, Sera, is by most supposed to be Singan, on theHoang-ho, but by some Peking. Pliny evidently refers to the same people,and has some notion of the locality of their country.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is generally supposed to bear reference to the cloths exported bythe Seres, as <hi rend="ital">Serica,</hi> and corresponding to our silks. On examination, however, it will appear that he rather refers to some textures of cotton, such ascalicos or muslins; it being not unknown to Pliny that silks or <hi rend="ital">bombycina</hi>were the produce of the bombyx or silk-worm; see B. xi. c. 22. The useof the word "canities" points strongly to cotton as being the substancemeant.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Whether it is silk or cotton that is here referred to, Pliny seems in this passage to allude to some peculiarity in the texture, which was perhapsso close, that when brought to the Western world it was the custom to drawout a portion of tie threads. In such case it perhaps strongly resembledthe Chinese crapes of the present day. Speaking of Cleopatra in B. x.141, of the Pharsalia, Lucan says, "Her white breasts are resplendentthrough the Sidonian fabric, which, wrought in close texture by the sleyof the Seres, the needle of the workman of the Nile has separated, and hasloosened the warp by stretching out the web."</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He either refers to dresses consisting of nothing but open work, orwhat we may call fine lace, and made from the closely woven material imported from China, or else to the 'Coan vestments' which were so muchworn by the Roman women, especially those of light character, in theAugustan age. This Coan tissue was remarkable for its extreme transparency. It has been supposed that these dresses were made of silk, as inthe island of Cos silk was spun and woven at an early period, so much soas to obtain a high celebrity for the manufactures of that island. Seneca,B. vii. De Benef. severely censures the practice of wearing these thin garments. For further information on this subject, see B. xi. c. 26, 27, andB. xii. c. 22.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Meaning that they do not actively seek intercourse with the rest ofthe world, but do not refuse to trade with those who will take the troubleof resorting to them. This coincides wonderfully with the character ofthe Chinese even at the present day.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ptolemy speaks of it as the Îchordas.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The headland of Malacca, in the Aurea Chersonnesns, was alsocalled by this name, but it is hardly probable that that is the place heremeant.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. iv. c. 18.</p></body>
