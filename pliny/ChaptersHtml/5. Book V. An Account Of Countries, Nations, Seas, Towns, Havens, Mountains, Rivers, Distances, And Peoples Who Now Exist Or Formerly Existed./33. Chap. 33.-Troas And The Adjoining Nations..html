<div2 type="chapter" n="33" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 33.—TROAS AND THE ADJOINING NATIONS.</head><p>The first place in Troas is Hamaxitus<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>, then Cebrenia<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>,and then Troas<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> itself, formerly called Antigonia, and nowAlexandria, a Roman colony. We then come to the townof Nee<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, the Scamander<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>, a navigable river, and the spotwhere in former times the town of Sigeum<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> stood, upon apromontory. We next come to the Port of the Achæans<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>, intowhich the Xanthus<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> flows after its union with the Simois<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>,and forms the Palæscamander<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>, which was formerly a lake.The other rivers, rendered famous by Homer, namely, theRhesus, the Heptaporus, the Caresus, and the Rhodius, haveleft no vestiges of their existence. The Granicus<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>, taking adifferent route, flows into the Propontis<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>. The small city ofScamandria, however, still exists, and, at a distance of a mile<pb n="1477" />and a half from its harbour, Ilium<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>, a place exempt fromtribute<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>, the fountain-head of universal fame. Beyond thegulf are the shores of Rhœteum<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>, peopled by the towns ofRhœteum<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span>, Dardanium<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span>, and Arisbe<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span>. There was also informer times a town of Achilleon<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span>, founded near the tomb ofAchilles by the people of Mitylene, and afterwards rebuiltby the Athenians, close to the spot where his fleet had beenstationed near Sigeum. There was also the town of Æantion<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span>,founded by the Rhodians upon the opposite point,near the tomb of Ajax, at a distance of thirty stadia fromSigeum, near the spot where his fleet was stationed. AboveÆolis and part of Troas, in the interior, is the place calledTeuthrania<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span>, inhabited in ancient times by the Mysians.Here rises the river Caicus already mentioned. Teuthraniawas a powerful nation in itself, even when the whole of Æoliswas held by the Mysians. In it are the Pioniæ<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span>, Andera<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span>,<pb n="1478" />Cale, Stabulum, Conisium, Teium, Balcea<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span>, Tiare, Teuthranie,Sarnaca, Haliserne, Lycide, Parthenium, Thymbre, Oxyopum,Lygdamum, Apollonia, and Pergamum<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span>, by far the most famouscity in Asia, and through which the river Selinus runs;the Cetius, which rises in Mount Pindasus, flowing beforeit. Not far from it is Elæa, which we have mentioned<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span> assituate on the sea-shore. The jurisdiction of this district iscalled that of Pergamus; to it resort the Thyatireni<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span>, theMosyni, the Mygdones<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span>, the Bregmeni, the Hierocometæ<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span>,the Perpereni, the Tiareni, the Hierolophienses, the Hermocapelitæ,the Attalenses<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span>, the Panteenses, the Apollonidienses,and some other states unknown to fame. The littletown of Dardanum<span id="ref_31"><a href="#note_31">[31]</a></span> is distant from Rhœteum seventy stadia.Eighteen miles thence is the Promontory of Trapeza<span id="ref_32"><a href="#note_32">[32]</a></span>, fromwhich spot the Hellespont first commences its course.</p><p>Eratosthenes tells us that in Asia there have perished thenations of the Solymi<span id="ref_33"><a href="#note_33">[33]</a></span>, the Leleges<span id="ref_34"><a href="#note_34">[34]</a></span>, the Bebryces<span id="ref_35"><a href="#note_35">[35]</a></span>, the<pb n="1479" />Colycantii, and the Tripsedri. Isidorus adds to these theArimi<span id="ref_36"><a href="#note_36">[36]</a></span>, as also the Capretæ, settled on the spot where Apamea<span id="ref_37"><a href="#note_37">[37]</a></span>stands, which was founded by King Seleucus, betweenCilicia, Cappadocia, Cataonia, and Armenia, and was at firstcalled Damea<span id="ref_38"><a href="#note_38">[38]</a></span>, from the fact that it had conquered nationsmost remarkable for their fierceness.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">On the south-western coast of the Troad, fifty stadia south of Larissa. In the time of Strabo it had ceased to exist. No ruins of this place have been known to be discovered, but Prokesch is induced to think that the architectural remains to be seen near Cape Baba are those of Hamaxitus.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or Cebrene or Cebren. It was separated from the territory of Scepsis by the river Menander. Leake supposes it to have occupied the higher region of Ida on the west, and that its site may have been at a place called Kushunlu Tepe, not far from Baramitsh.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Mentioned in Acts xvi. 8. It is now called Eski Stambul or Old Stambul. It was situate on the coast of Troas, opposite to the south-eastern point of the island of Tenedos, and north of Assus. It was founded by Antigonus, under the name of Antigonia Troas, and peopled with settlers from Scepsis and other neighbouring towns. The ruins of this city are very extensive.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or Nea, mentioned in B. ii. c. 97.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called the Mendereh-Chai.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">On the north-west promontory of Troas.

The promontory is now called Yenisheri.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called Jeni-Scher, according to Ansart. It was at this spot that the Greeks landed in their expedition against Troy.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Usually identified with the Mendereh-Chai or Scamander.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The modern Gumbrek.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "ancient Scamander."</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now known as the Koja-Chai; memorable as the scene of the three great victories by which Alexander the Great overthrew the Persian empire, B.C. <date value="-334" authname="-334">334</date>.

The site of New Ilium is generally considered to be the spot covered with ruins, now called Kissarlik, between the villages called Kum-kioi, Kalli-fath, and Tchiblak.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Dictator Sylla showed especial favour to Ilium.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called Cape Intepeh or Barbieri.</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The modern Paleo Castro probably occupies its site.</p><p><span id="note_17"><a href="#ref_17">17. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">More generally called Dardanus, or Dardanum, said to have been built by Dardanus. It was situate about a mile south of the promontory Dardanis or Dardanium. Its exact site does not appear to be known: from it the modern Dardanelles are supposed to have derived their name.</p><p><span id="note_18"><a href="#ref_18">18. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Situate between Percote and Abydus, and founded by Scamandrius and Ascanius the son of Æneas.

Its ruins are to be seen at the modern Pergamo or Bergamo. It was the capital of the kingdom of Pergamus, and situate in the Tcuthranian district of Mysia, on the northern bank of the river Caïcus. Under its kings, its library almost equalled that of Alexandria, and the formation of it gave rise to the invention of parchment, as a writing material, which was thence called <hi rend="ital">Charta Pergamena.</hi> This city was an early seat of Christianity, and is one of the seven churches of Asia to whom the Apocalyptic Epistles are addressed.
