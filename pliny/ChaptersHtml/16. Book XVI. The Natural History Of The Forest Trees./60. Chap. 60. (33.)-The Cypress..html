(33.)—THE CYPRESS.</head><p>The cypress<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> is an exotic, and has been reckoned one of thetrees that are naturalized with the greatest difficulty; so muchso, indeed, that Cato<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> has expatiated upon it at greater lengthand more frequently than any of the others. This tree isnaturally of a stubborn<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> disposition, bears a fruit that is utterly<pb n="3398" />useless, a berry that causes a wry<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> face when tasted, and a leafthat is bitter: it also gives out a disagreeable pungent smell,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>and its shade is far from agreeable. The wood that it furnishesis but scanty, so much so indeed, that it may be almost regardedas little more than a shrub. This tree is sacred to Pluto,and hence it is used as a sign of mourning<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> placed at theentrance of a house: the female<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> tree is for a long time barren.The pyramidal appearance that it presents has caused it not tobe rejected, but for a long time it was only used for markingthe intervals between rows of pines: at the present day, however, it is clipped and trained to form hedge-rows, or else isthinned and lengthened out in the various designs<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> employed inornamental gardening, and which represent scenes of hunting,fleets, and various other objects: these it covers with a thinsmall leaf, which is always green.</p><p>There are two varieties of the cypress; the one<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> taperingand pyramidal, and which is known as the female; while themale tree<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> throws its branches straight out from the body, andis often pruned and employed as a rest for the vine. Boththe male and the female are permitted to throw out theirbranches, which are cut and employed for poles and props,being worth, after thirteen years' growth, a denarius a-piece.In respect of income, a plantation of cypress is remarkablyprofitable, so much so, indeed, that it was a saying in old timesthat a cypress-wood is a dowry for a daughter.<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> The nativecountry of this tree is the island of Crete, although Cato<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>calls it Tarentine, Tarentum being the first place, I suppose,in which it was naturalized: in the island of Ænaria,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> also,<pb n="3399" />if the cypress is cut down, it will grow again<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> from the root.But, in the Isle of Crete, in whatever place the earth is moved,this tree will shoot up<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> of its own natural vigour, and immediately appear above the soil; indeed, in that island there isno occasion even to solicit the soil, for it grows spontaneouslythere, on the mountains of Ida more particularly, and thoseknown as the White Mountains. On the very summit ofthese elevations, from which the snows never depart, we findthe cypress growing in great abundance; a thing that is trulymarvellous-seeing that, in other countries, it will only growin warm localities; from which it would appear to have a greatdislike to its native climate.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Cupressus sempervirens of Linnæus, the Cupressus fastigiata ofDecandolle.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">De Re Rust. cc. 48,151.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Morosa;" meaning that it reaches maturity but very slowly.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Tristis tentantum sensu torquebit amaror.—Virg.
