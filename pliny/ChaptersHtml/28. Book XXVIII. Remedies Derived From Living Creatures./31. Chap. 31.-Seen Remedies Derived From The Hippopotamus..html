The hippopo-<pb n="5319" />tamus was the first inventor of the practice of letting blood, afact to which we have<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> made allusion on a previous occasion:it is found, too, in the greatest numbers in the parts above theprefecture of Saïs.</p><p>The hide, reduced to ashes and applied with water, is curative of inflamed tumours, and the fat, as well as the dung,used as a fumigation, is employed for the cure of cold agues.With the teeth of the left side of the jaw, the gums arescarified for the cure of tooth-ache. The skin of the left side ofthe forehead, attached to the groin, acts as an antaphrodisiac; andan application of the ashes of the same part will cause the hairto grow when lost through alopecy. The testes are taken inwater, in doses of one drachma, for the cure of injuries inflictedby serpents. The blood is made use of by painters.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. viii. c. 40.</p></body>
