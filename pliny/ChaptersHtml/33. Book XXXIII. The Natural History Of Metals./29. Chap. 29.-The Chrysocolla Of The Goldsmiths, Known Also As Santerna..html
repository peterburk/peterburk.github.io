<div2 type="chapter" n="29" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 29.â€”THE CHRYSOCOLLA OF THE GOLDSMITHS, KNOWN ALSOAS SANTERNA.</head><p>The goldsmiths also employ a chrysocolla<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> of their own, forthe purpose of soldering gold; and it is from this chrysocolla,they say, that all the other substances, which present a similargreen, have received their name. This preparation is madefrom verdigris of Cyprian copper, the urine of a youth whohas not arrived at puberty, and a portion of nitre.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> It is thenpounded with a pestle of Cyprian copper, in a copper mortar,and the name given to the mixture is "santerna." It is in thisway that the gold known as "silvery"<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> gold is soldered; onesign of its being so alloyed being its additional brilliancy onthe application of santerna. If, on the other hand, the goldis impregnated with copper, it will contract, on coming incontact with the santerna, become dull, and only be solderedwith the greatest difficulty: indeed, for this last kind of gold,there is a peculiar solder employed, made of gold and one-seventhpart of silver, in addition to the materials above-mentioned,the whole beaten up together.<pb n="6111" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Gold-glue or gold-solder.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxxi. c. 46, as to the "nitrum" of Pliny.
