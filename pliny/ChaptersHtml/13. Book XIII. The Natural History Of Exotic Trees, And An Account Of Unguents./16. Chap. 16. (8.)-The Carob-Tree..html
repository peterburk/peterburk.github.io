(8.)—THE CAROB-TREE.</head><p>Similar to this is the carob-tree, by the Ionians known asthe "ceraunia,"<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> which in a similar manner bears fruit frontthe trunk, this fruit being known by the name of "siliqua,"or "pod." For this reason, committing a manifest error,some persons<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> have called it the Egyptian fig; it being thefact that this tree does not grow in Egypt, but in Syria andIonia, in the vicinity, too, of Cnidos, and in the island ofRhodes. It is always covered with leaves, and bears a whiteflower with a very powerful odour. It sends forth shoots at<pb n="3182" />the lower part, and is consequently quite yellow on the surface, as the young suckers deprive the trunk of the requisitemoisture. When the fruit of the preceding year is gathered,about the rising of the Dog-star, fresh fruit immediately makesits appearance; after which the tree blossoms while the constellation of Arcturus<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> is above the horizon, and the winterimparts nourishment to the fruit.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Ceratonia siliqua of Linnæus.
