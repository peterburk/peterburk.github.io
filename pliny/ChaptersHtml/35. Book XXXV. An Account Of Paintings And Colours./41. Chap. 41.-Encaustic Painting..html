When, however, this art came to be applied to thepainting of ships of war, a third method was adopted, that ofmelting the wax colours and laying them on with a brush,while hot.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> Painting of this nature,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> applied to vessels, willnever spoil from the action of the sun, winds, or salt water.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See Chapter 39 of this Book.
