<div2 type="chapter" n="52" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 52.ÑOTHER ANIMALS WHICH CHANGE COLOUR; THE TARANDUS, THE LYCAON, AND THE THOS.</head><p>The tarandrus,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> too, of the Scythians, changes its colour,but this is the case with none of the animals which are coveredwith hair, except the lycaon<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> of India, which is said to havea mane on the neck. But with respect to the thos,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> (which isa species of wolf, differing from the common kind in having alarger body and very short legs, leaping with great activity,living by the chase, and never attacking man); it changes its<pb n="2305" />coat, and not its colour, for it is covered with hair in the winter,and goes bare in summer. The tarandrus is of the size ofthe ox; its head is larger than that of the stag, and not veryunlike it; its horns are branched, its hoofs cloven, and itshair as long as that of the bear. Its proper colour, when itthinks proper to return to it, is like that of the ass. Its hideis of such extreme hardness, that it is used for making breastplates. When it is frightened, this animal reflects the colourof all the trees, shrubs, and flowers, or of the spots in which itis concealed; hence it is that it is so rarely captured. It iswonderful that such various hues should be given to the body,but still more so that it should be given to the hair.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier remarks, that this account is from the anonymous treatiseDe Mirab. Auscult. p. 1152, and from Theophrastus; and that it was probably derived, in the first instance, from the imperfect account which theancients possessed of the reindeer, the hair of which animal becomesnearly white in the winter, and in the summer of a brown or grey colour.Bekmann, however, who has written a commentary on the above-mentionedtreatise, supposes that the tarandrus is the elk. Cuvier conceives, that theanimal described by C¾sar, Bell. Gall. B. vi. c. 26, as inhabiting theHercynian Forest, which he designates as "bos cervi figura," is the reindeer; and suggests that "tarandrus" may have originated in the German,<hi rend="ital">das rennthier.</hi> Ajasson, vol. vi. pp. 453, 454; Lemaire, vol. iii. pp. 456, 457.®lian, Anim. Nat. B. ii. c. 16, speaks of the change of colour in the tarandrus in a way which does not correspond with any animal known toexist.ÑB. Pliny's stories of the tarandrus, thos, and chameleon are ridiculed by Rabelais, B. iv. c. 3.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier supposes that the lycaon of Pliny is the Indian tiger, whichhas a mane; but what is said of its change of colour is incorrect.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Naturalists have differed respecting the identity of the animal heredescribed, but Cuvier conceives, that Bochart has proved it to be the canisaureus chakal (jackal) of Linn¾us. The description given by Aristotle,Hist. Anim. B. ii. c. 17, and B. ix. c. 44, agrees with this supposition;it is also described by Oppian, Halieut. B. ii. c. 615.ÑB.</p></body>
