<div2 type="chapter" n="28" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 28.—THE PERSIAN AND THE ARABIAN GULFS.</head><p>The sea then makes a two-fold indentations<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> in the landupon these coasts, under the name of Rubrum<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> or "Red,"given to it by our countrymen; while the Greeks have calledit Erythrum, from king Erythras,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> or, according to somewriters, from its red colour, which they think is produced bythe reflection of the sun's rays; others again are of opinionthat it arises from the sand and the complexion of the soil,others from some peculiarity in the nature of the water.(24.) Be this as it may, this body of water is divided into twogulfs. The one which lies to the east is called the Persian Gulf,and is two thousand five hundred miles in circumference, according to Eratosthenes. Opposite to it lies Arabia, the lengthof which is fifteen hundred miles. On the other side again,Arabia is bounded by the Arabian Gulf. The sea as it enters<pb n="2067" />this gulf is called the Azanian<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> Sea. The Persian Gulf, at theentrance, is only five<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> miles wide; some writers make it four.From the entrance to the very bottom of the gulf, in a straightline, has been ascertained to be nearly eleven hundred andtwenty-five miles: in outline it strongly resembles<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> the humanhead. Onesicritus and Nearchus have stated in their worksthat from the river Indus to the Persian Gulf, and from thenceto Babylon, situate in the marshes of the Euphrates, is a distance of seventeen hundred miles.</p><p>In the angle of Carmania are the Chelonophagi,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> who covertheir cabins with the shells of turtles, and live upon theirflesh; these people inhabit the next promontory that is seenafter leaving the river Arbis;<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> with the exception of the head,they are covered all over with long hair, and are clothed inthe skins of fishes.</p><p>(25.) Beyond their district, in the direction of India, is saidto be the desert island of Caicandrus, fifty miles out at sea; nearto which, with a strait flowing between them, is Stoidis, celebrated for its valuable pearls. After passing the promontory<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>are the Armozei,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> joining up to the Carmani; some writers,however, place between them the Arbii,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> extending along theshore a distance of four hundred and twenty-one miles. Hereis a place called Portus Macedonum,<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> and the Altars of Alexander, situate on a promontory, besides the rivers Saganos,Daras, and Salsa. Beyond the last river we come to the promontory of Themisteas, and the island of Aphrodisias, whichis peopled. Here Persis begins, at the river Oratis,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> which<pb n="2068" />separates it from Elymais.<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> Opposite to the coast of Persis,are the islands of Psilos, Cassandra, and Aracia, the lastsacred to Neptune,<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> and containing a mountain of great height.Persis<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> itself, looking towards the west, has a line of coastfive hundred and fifty miles in length; it is a country opulenteven to luxury, but has long since changed its name for thatof "Parthia."<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> I shall now devote a few words to the Parthianempire.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Forms two bays or gulfs in succession.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He gives this name to the whole expanse of sea that lies betweenArabia and Africa on the west, and India on the east, including the RedSea and the Persian Gulf.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or Erythrus.
