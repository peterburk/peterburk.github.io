A sprinkling of polentaupon the sores is also used. For carbuncles and other sores ofthe generative organs, wool-grease is used as a remedy, withrefuse of lead; and for incipient carbuncles, sheep's dung isemployed.. Tumours and all other affections that stand in needof emollients are treated most effectually with goose-grease;that of cranes, too, is equally efficacious.</p></div2></body>
