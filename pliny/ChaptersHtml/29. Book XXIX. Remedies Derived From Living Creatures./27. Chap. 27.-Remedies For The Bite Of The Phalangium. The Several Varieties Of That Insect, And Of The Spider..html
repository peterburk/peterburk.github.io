<div2 type="chapter" n="27" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 27.—REMEDIES FOR THE BITE OF THE PHALANGIUM. THESEVERAL VARIETIES OF THAT INSECT, AND OF THE SPIDER.</head><p>Of the phalangium,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> an insect unknown to Italy, there are<pb n="5401" />numerous kinds; one of which resembles the ant, but is muchlarger, with a red head, black as to the other parts of thebody, and covered with white spots. Its sting is much moreacute than that of the wasp, and it lives mostly in the vicinityof ovens and mills. The proper remedy is, to present beforethe eyes of the person stung another insect of the same description, a purpose for which they are preserved when founddead. Their husks also, found in a dry state, are beaten upand taken in drink for a similar purpose. The young of theweasel, too, as already<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> stated, are possessed of a similar property. The Greeks give the name of "phalangion" also to akind of spider, but they generally distinguish it by the surnameof the "wolf."<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> A third kind, also known as the "phalangium," is a spider with a hairy<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> body, and a head of enormoussize. When opened, there are found in it two small worms,they say: these, attached in a piece of deer's skin, before sunrise, to a woman's body, will prevent conception, according towhat Cæcilius, in his Commentaries, says. This property lasts,however, for a year only; and, indeed, it is the only one of allthe anti-conceptives<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> that I feel myself at liberty to mention,in favour of some women whose fecundity, quite teeming withchildren,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> stands in need of some such respite.</p><p>There is another kind again, called "rhagion,"<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> similar toa black grape in appearance, with a very diminutive mouth,situate beneath the abdomen, and extremely short legs, whichhave all the appearance of not being fully developed. The biteof this last insect causes fully as much pain as the sting of thescorpion, and the urine of persons who are injured by it, presents filmy appearances like cobwebs. The asterion<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> would beidentical with it, were it not distinguished by white streaksupon the body: its bite causes failing in the knees. Butworse than either of these last, is a blue spider, covered withblack hair, and causing dimness of the sight and vomiting ofa matter like cobwebs in appearance. A still more dangerouskind is one which differs only from the hornet, in form, in<pb n="5402" />being destitute of wings, and the bite of which causes awasting away of the system. The myrmecion<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> in the headresembles the ant, has a black body spotted with white, andcauses by its bite a pain like that attendant upon the sting ofthe wasp. Of the tetragnathius<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> there are two varieties, themore noxious of which has two white streaks crossing eachother on the middle of the head; its bite causes the mouthto swell. The other one is of an ashy colour, whitish on theposterior part of the body, and not so ready to bite.</p><p>The least noxious of all is the spider that is seen extendingits web along the walls, and lying in wait for flies; it is of thesame ashy colour as the last.</p><p>For the bite of all spiders, the best remedies are: a cock'sbrains, taken in oxycrate with a little pepper; five ants, swallowed in drink; sheep's dung, applied in vinegar; and spidersof any kind, left to putrefy in oil. The bite of the shrewmouse is cured by taking lamb's rennet in wine; the ashes of aram's foot with honey; or a young weasel, prepared in manneralready<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> mentioned by us when speaking of serpents. Incases where a shrewmouse has bitten beasts of burden, a mouse,.fresh caught, is applied to the wound with oil, or a bat's gallwith vinegar. The shrew-mouse itself too, split asunder andapplied to the wound, is a cure for its bite; indeed, if theanimal is with young when the injury is inflicted, it willinstantly burst asunder. The best plan is to apply the mouseitself which has inflicted the bite, but others are commonlykept for this purpose, either steeped in oil or coated with clay.Another remedy, again, for its bite is the earth taken from therut made by a cart-wheel; for this animal, it is said, owingto a certain torpor which is natural to it, will never cross<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>a rut made by a wheel.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A sort of spider.
