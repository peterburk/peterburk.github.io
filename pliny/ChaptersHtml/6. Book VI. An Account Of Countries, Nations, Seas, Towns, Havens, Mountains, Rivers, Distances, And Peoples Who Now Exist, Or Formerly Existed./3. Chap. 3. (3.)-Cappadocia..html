In Colopene it has Sebastia and Sebastopolis;<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> these are insignificant places, but still equal in importance to those just mentioned. In its remaining districtsthere is Melita,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> founded by Semiramis, and not far from the Euphrates, Diocæsarea,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> Tyana,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> Castabala,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> Magnopolis,<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span><pb n="2007" />Zela,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> and at the foot of Mount Argæus<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> Mazaca, now calledCæsarea.<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> That part of Cappadocia which lies stretched outbefore the Greater Armenia is called Melitene, before Commagene Cataonia, before Phrygia Garsauritis, Sargarausene,<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span>and Cammanene, before Galatia Morimene, where their territories are divided by the river Cappadox,<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> from which thispeople have taken their name; they were formerly known asthe Leucosyri.<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> From Neocæsarea above mentioned, thelesser Armenia is separated by the river Lycus. In the interior also there is the famous river Ceraunus,<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> and on thecoast beyond the town of Amisus, the town and river ofChadisia,<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> and the town of Lycastum,<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> after which the regionof Themiseyra<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> begins.<pb n="2008" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The boundaries of Cappadocia varied under the dominion of the Persians, after the Macedonian conquest, and as a Roman province under the emperors.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Founded by Archelaüs, the last king of Cappadocia. In Hamilton's <hi rend="ital">Researches,</hi> the site has been assumed to be the modern Ak-serai, but that place is not on the river Halys, as Leake supposes. It is, however, considered that Ak-serai agrees very well with the position of Archelais as laid down in the Itineraries, and that Pliny may have been misled in supposing that the stream on which it stood was the Halys.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Also called by the name of Chryse, or "Golden," to distinguish it from another place of the same name in Pontus. It is generally supposed that the town of Al-Bostan, on the Sihoon or Sarus, is on or near the site of this Comana.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called Niksar, according to D'Anville, though Hardouin saysthat it is Tocat. Parisot remarks, that this place belonged rather toPontus than to Cappadocia.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A small tributary of the Iris, or Yeshil-Irmak, mentioned in the nextChapter.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Both to the west of Neo-Cæsarea. According to Tavernier, as quotedby Hardouin, the modern name of Sebastia is Sivas.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Still called Amasia, or Amasiyeh, and situate on the river Iris, or Yeshil Ermak. It was at one time the residence of the princes of Pontus, and the birth-place of the geographer Strabo. The remains of antiquity here are very considerable, and extremely interesting.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Which gave name to the district of Melitene, mentioned in c. 20 of the last Book.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Near Nazianzus, in Cappadocia, the birth-place of Gregory Nazianzen. The traveller Ainsworth, on his road from Ak Serai to Kara Hissar, came to a place called Kaisar Koi, and he has remarked that by its name and position it might be identified with Diocæsarea. Some geographers, indeed, look upon Diocæsarea and Nazianzus as the same place.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Its ruins are still to be seen at Kiz Hisar. It stood in the southof Cappadocia, at the northern foot of Mount Taurus. Tyana was the native place of Apollonius, the supposed worker of miracles, whom theenemies of Christianity have not scrupled to place on a par with JesusChrist.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Some ruins, nineteen geographical miles from Ayas, are supposed todenote the site of ancient Castabala or Castabulum.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This place was first called Eupatoria, but not the same which Mithridates united with a part of Amisus. D'Anville supposes that the modern town of Tchenikeb occupies its site.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or Ziela, now known as Zillah, not far south of Amasia. It was here that Julius Cæsar conquered Pharnaces, on the occasion on which he wrote his dispatch to Rome, "Veni, vidi, vici."</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Still known by the name of Ardgeh-Dagh.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Its site is still called Kaisiriyeh. It was a city of the district Cilicia, in Cappadocia, at the base of the mountain Argæus. It was first called Mazaca, and after that, Eusebeia. There are considerable remains of the ancient city.</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hardouin remarks, that the district of Sargarausene was not situate in front of Phrygia, but lay between Morimene and Colopenene, in the vicinity of Pontus.</p><p><span id="note_17"><a href="#ref_17">17. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now known as the Konax, a tributary of the Halys, rising in Mount Littarus, in the chain of Paryadres.</p><p><span id="note_18"><a href="#ref_18">18. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "White Syrians." Strabo says that in his time both the Cappadocian peoples, those situate above the Taurus and those on the Euxine, were called Leucosyri, or <hi rend="ital">White</hi> Syrians, as there were some Syrians who were black, and who dwelt to the east of the Amanus.</p><p><span id="note_19"><a href="#ref_19">19. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is doubtful whether this is the name of a river or a town. Notwithstanding its alleged celebrity, nothing is known of it.</p><p><span id="note_20"><a href="#ref_20">20. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hecatæus, as quoted by Stephanus Byzantinus, speaks of Chadisia asa city of the Leucosyri, or Cappadocians. Neither the river nor the townappears to have been identified.</p><p><span id="note_21"><a href="#ref_21">21. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably on the river of that name, which has been identified with the Mers Imak, a river two or three miles east of the Acropolis of Amisus.</p><p><span id="note_22"><a href="#ref_22">22. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The extensive plain on the coast of Pontus, extending east of the river Iris, beyond the Thermodon, and celebrated as the country of the Amazons. At the mouth of the Thermodon was a city of the same name, which had been destroyed by the time of Augustus. It is doubtful whether the modern Thermeh occupies its site.</p></body>
