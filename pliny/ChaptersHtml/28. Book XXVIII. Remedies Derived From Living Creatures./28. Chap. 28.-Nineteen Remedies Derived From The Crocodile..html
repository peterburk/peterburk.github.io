<div2 type="chapter" n="28" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 28.—NINETEEN REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE CROCODILE.</head><p>For fabulous stories connected with it the crocodile maychallenge the next place; and, indeed for cunning, the one<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>which lives both upon land and in the water is fully its equal:for I would here remark, that there are two varieties of thisanimal. The teeth of the right jaw of the amphibious crocodile, attached to the right arm as an amulet, acts as an aphrodisiac, that is, if we choose to believe it. The eye-teeth ofthe animal, filled with frankincense—for they are hollow—area cure for periodical fevers, care being taken to let the patientremain five days without seeing the person who has attachedthem to his body. A similar virtue is attributed to the smallstones which are found in the belly of this animal, as being acheck to the cold shiverings in fevers, when about to come on;and with the same object the Ægyptians are in the habit ofanointing their sick with the fat of the crocodile.</p><p>The other kind of crocodile<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> resembles it, but is much inferior in size: it lives upon land only, and among the mostodoriferous flowers; hence it is that its intestines are so greatlyin request, being filled as they are with a mass of agreeableperfumes. This substance is called "crocodilea," and it islooked upon as extremely beneficial for diseases of the eyes,and for the treatment of films and cataract, being applied withleek-juice in the form of an ointment. Applied with oil ofcyprus,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> it removes blemishes growing upon the face; and, employed with water, it is a cure for all those diseases, thenature of which it is to spread upon the face, while at the sametime it restores the natural tints of the skin. An applicationof it makes freckles disappear, as well as all kinds of spots and<pb n="5315" />pimples; and it is taken for epilepsy, in doses of two oboli, inoxymel. Used in the form of a pessary it acts as an emmenagogue. The best kind of crocodilea, is that which is the whitest,friable, and the lightest in weight: when rubbed between thefingers it should ferment like leaven. The usual method isto wash it, as they do white lead. It is sometimes adulteratedwith amylum<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> or with Cimolian earth, but the most commonmethod of sophistication is to catch the crocodiles and feedthem upon nothing but rice. It is recommended as one ofthe most efficient remedies for cataract to anoint the eyes withcrocodile's gall, incorporated with honey. We are assuredalso that it is highly beneficial for affections of the uterus tomake fumigations with the intestines and rest of the body, orelse to envelope the patient with wool impregnated with thesmoke.</p><p>The ashes of the skin of either crocodile, applied with vinegarto such parts of the body as are about to undergo an incision,or indeed the very smell of the skin when burning, will renderthe patient insensible to the knife. The blood of either crocodile, applied to the eyes, effaces marks upon those organs andimproves the sight. The body, with the exception of the headand feet, is eaten, boiled, for the cure of sciatica, and is foundvery useful for chronic coughs, in children more particularly:it is equally good, too, for the cure of lumbago. These animalshave a certain fat also, which, applied to the hair, makes it falloff; persons anointed with this fat are effectually protectedagainst crocodiles, and it is the practice to drop it into woundsinflicted by them. A crocodile's heart, attached to the bodyin the wool of a black sheep without a speck of any othercolour, due care too being taken that the sheep was the firstlamb yeaned by its dam, will effectually cure a quartan fever,it is said.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Identified by Ajasson with the <hi rend="ital">chamses,</hi> or common crocodile of theNile.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. viii. c. 38.

It is equally amphibious with the other; and the accountof its habits given by Pliny is probably founded on the fact that UpperEgypt, which it inhabits, is covered with a more aromatic vegetation thanthe other parts of that country.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xii. c. 51.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xviii.
