<div2 type="chapter" n="8" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 8.—THE OTHER ACORNS-WOOD FOR FUEL.</head><p>The other trees that bear acorns, properly so called, are the<pb n="3347" />robur, the æsculus, the cerrus, the holm-oak,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and the corktree:<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> it is contained in a rivelled calyx, which embracesmore or less of it, according to the several varieties. Theleaves of these trees, those of the holm-oak excepted, areweighty, pulpy, long, and jagged at the edges, and they donot turn yellow before they fall, as with the beech: they arealso longer or shorter, as the case may be.</p><p>There are two kinds<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> of holm-oak: one of them, whichbelongs to Italy, has a leaf not very unlike that of the olive;some of the Greeks give it the name of "milax,"<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and in ourprovinces it is known as the aquifolia. The acorn of thesetwo kinds is shorter and more slender than in the others:Homer<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> calls it "acylos," and by that name distinguishes itfrom the ordinary acorn: it is generally said that the maletree of the holm-oak bears no fruit.</p><p>The best acorn, and the very largest, is that which growsupon the quercus, and the next to it is the fruit of the aæscu-lus: that of the robur, again, is diminutive, and the fruit ofthe cerrus has a meagre, wretched look, being enclosed in acalyx covered with prickles, like the outer coat of the chesnut. With reference to the acorn of the quercus, that whichgrows upon the female tree<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> is sweeter and more tender,while that of the male is more solid and compact. The acorn,however, of the latifolia<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> is the most esteemed, an oak so<pb n="3348" />called from the remarkable broadness of its leaves. The acornsdiffer also among themselves in size, and the comparativefineness of the outer shell; as also in the circumstance thatsome have beneath the shell a rough coat of a rusty colour,while in others a white flesh immediately presents itself.Those, too, are more particularly esteemed, the two extremities of the nut of which, taken lengthwise, are as hard as astone: and it is considered preferable that this peculiarityshould present itself rather in the shell than in the flesh: ineither case, however, it only exists in the fruit of the male tree.In some kinds, again, the acorn is oval, in others round;while in others it is of a more pointed form. The colour, too,varies considerably, according as it is blacker or whiter; thislast being held in the highest esteem. The extremities of theacorn are bitter, but the flesh in the middle of it is sweet;<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>another difference, too, consists in the comparative length orshortness of the stalk.</p><p>As for the trees themselves, the one that bears the acorn oflargest size is known as the "hemeris;"<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> a small tree witha thick bushy foliage all around it, and often hollowed at theplace where the branch is joined to the trunk. The quercushas a stronger wood, and less susceptible of decay: this also isa very branchy tree, but is much taller than the last, whilethe trunk is considerably thicker. The ægilops,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> however, isthe highest of them all, and is much attached to wild, uncultivated spots. Next to this in height is the latifolia, but itswood is far from being so useful either for building purposesor for charcoal. When rough-hewn it is very apt to spoil,hence it is that it is generally used in an unhewn state. Ascharcoal, it is considered only economical in smelting copper;for the moment the workman ceases to blow, the fire dies out,and hence it requires to be repeatedly rekindled; while at thesame time it gives out great quantities of sparks. The best<pb n="3349" />charcoal is that obtained from the wood of young trees.<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>Square billets of wood, newly cut, are piled compactly togetherwith clay, and built up in the form of a chimney; the pile isthen set fire to, and incisions are made in the coat of clay as itgradually hardens, by the aid of long poles, for the purpose ofletting the moisture of the wood evaporate.</p><p>The worst kind of all, however, both for timber and formaking charcoal, is the oak known as the "haliphlœos,"<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> thebark of which is remarkably thick, and the trunk of considerable size, but mostly hollow and spongy: it is the only oneof this species that rots while the tree is still alive. Inaddition to this, it is very frequently struck by lightning,although it is not so remarkably lofty in height: for thisreason it is not considered lawful to employ its wood for thepurposes of sacrifice. It is but rarely that it bears any acorns,and when it does they are bitter: no animal will touch them,with the sole exception of swine, and not even they, if theycan get any other food. An additional reason also for its exclusion from all religious ceremonials, is the circumstancethat the fire is very apt to go out in the middle of thesacrifice when the wood of it is used for fuel.</p><p>The acorn of the beech, when given to swine,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> makes thembrisk and lively, and renders the flesh tender for cooking, andlight and easy of digestion; while, on the other hand, that ofthe holm oak has the effect of making them thin, pallid,meagre, and lumpish. The acorn of the quercus is of a broadshape, and is the heaviest as well as the sweetest of themall. According to Nigidius, the acorn of the cerrus occupiesthe next rank to this, and, indeed, there is no acorn thatrenders the flesh of swine more firm, though at the same timeit is apt to impart a certain degree of hardness. The sameauthor assures us also, that the acorn of the holm oak is atrying diet for swine, unless it is given in very small quan-<pb n="3350" />tities at a time. He says, too, that this acorn is the lastto fall, and that the flesh of swine, if fed upon the acornsof the æsculus, the robur, or the cork-tree, will be of aspongy nature.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Ilex." Fée thinks that the varieties known as the Prinos and theBallota were often confounded by the ancients with the "ilex" or "holm-oak." This tree, he says, bears no resemblance to the ordinary oak, exceptin the blossoms and the fruit. It is the Ilex of Linnæus, the "yeuse," orgreen oak," of the French.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Quercus suber of Linnæus; it is found more particularly in thedepartment of the Landes in France.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">As Fée remarks, Pliny is clearly in error here; one kind being theveritable ilex or holm oak, the other, the aquifolium or holly, quite a dif-ferent tree.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The smilax or milax was a real holm oak, but the aquifolia was the holly.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Od. xi. 242. Fée remarks that the berry of the holly has no resemblance to the acorn whatever, and he says that this statement of Pliny almost leads him to think that the second variety here mentioned by him wasnot in reality the holly, but a variety of the quercus.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Fée observes that, properly speaking, there is no sex in the oak, theindividuals being neither male nor female.
