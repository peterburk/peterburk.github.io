<div2 type="chapter" n="36" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 36.—THE NYCTEGRETON, CHENOMYCHE, OR NYCTALOPS.</head><p>Democritus has regarded the nyctegreton<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> as one of themost singular of plants. According to that author, it is of adark red colour, has leaves like those of a thorn, and creepsupon the ground. He says that it grows in Gedrosia<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> moreparticularly, and that it is taken up by the roots immediatelyafter the vernal equinox, and dried in the moonlight for thirtydays; after which preparation it emits light by night. Hestates also, that the Magi and the kings of Parthia employ this plant in their ceremonies when they make a vow toperform an undertaking; that another name given to it is"chenomyche,"<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> from the circumstance that, at the verysight of it, geese will manifest the greatest alarm; and that bysome persons, again, it is known as the "nyctalops,"<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> from thelight which it emits at a considerable distance by night.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The "night-watcher." According to Sprengel, this is the Cæsalpinapulcherrima of Linnæus. But, as Fée says, that is entirely an Indianplant, and has only been introduced but very recently into Europe. Hardouin identifies it with a plant called "lunaria" by the naturalists of hisday, which shines, he says, with the moon at night.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Cæsalpina pulcherrima is not to be found in or near Gedrosia (inancient Persia), but solely on the shores of the Bay of Bengal.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From <foreign lang="greek">xh=nes,</foreign> "geese," and <foreign lang="greek">mu/xos,</foreign> a "corner;" because geese runinto a corner on seeing it.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">As to the meaning of this word, see B. xxviii. c. 47.</p></body>
