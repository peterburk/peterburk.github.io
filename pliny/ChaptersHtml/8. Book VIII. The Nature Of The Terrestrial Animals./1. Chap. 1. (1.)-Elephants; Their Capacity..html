<div2 type="chapter" n="1" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 1. (1.)ÑELEPHANTS; THEIR CAPACITY.</head><p>LET US now pass on to the other animals, and first of all to theland animals. The elephant is the largest of them all, and inintelligence approaches the nearest to man. It understands thelanguage of its country, it obeys commands, and it remembersall the duties which it has been taught. It is sensiblealike of the pleasures of love and glory, and, to a degreethat is rare among men even, possesses notions of honesty,prudence, and equity; it has a religious respect also forthe stars, and a veneration for the sun and the moon.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> Itis said by some authors, that, at the first appearance of thenew moon, herds of these animals come down from the forestsof Mauritania to a river, the name of which is Amilos;<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>and that they there purify themselves in solemn form bysprinkling their bodies with water; after which, having thussaluted the heavenly body, they return to the woods, carryingbefore them<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> the young ones which are fatigued. They aresupposed to have a notion, too, of the differences of religion;<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span><pb n="2245" />and when about to cross the sea, they cannot be prevailedupon to go on board the ship, until their keeper has promisedupon oath that they shall return home again. They have beenseen, too, when worn out by disease, (for even these vast massesare liable to disease,) lying on their back, and throwing the grassup into the air, as if deputing the earth to intercede for themwith its prayers.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> As a proof of their extreme docility, theypay homage to the king, fall upon their knees, and offer himthe crown. Those of smaller growth, which the Indians callbastards,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> are employed by them in ploughing.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier remarks, that this account of its superior intelligence is exaggerated, it being no greater than that of the dog, if, indeed, equal to it.The opinion may perhaps have arisen from the dexterity with which theanimal uses its trunk; but this is to be ascribed not to its own intelligence, but to the mechanical construction of the part. The Indians, fromwhom we may presume that Pliny derived his account, have always regarded the elephant with a kind of superstitious veneration.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Some would read this "Amilo," and others "Annulo." Hardouinconsiders it the same with the river Valo, which is mentioned by Ptolemy,B. iv. c. 1, and said to have its rise in the mountains known as the SevenBrothers, and mentioned in B. v. c. 1.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Pr¾ se ferentes," probably alluding to the use which the animalmakes of its trunk in seizing and carrying bodies.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Alien¾ religionis." The meaning of this is doubtful. It may mean"differences in religion," or "religious feeling in others," or perhaps, tojudge from the context, "the religious regard for their oath which othersfeel."</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Veluti tellure precibus alligata," one of the harsh metaphorical expressions occasionally occurring in Pliny, which it is very difficult to translate, and even perhaps fully to comprehend.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Nothi."</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier remarks, that there are two kinds of elephants, one of whichattains sixteen feet, and is chiefly known in Cochin China and Tonquin,while those that are domesticated in India are seldom more than half thatheight. They are supposed, however, to be only varieties of the same species. Pliny, in B. vi. c. 22, gives an account of the uses which the Indiansmade of the elephant, and of their different sizes, but he does not statethere that it is the smaller ones only that are employed in agriculture.ÑB.</p></body>
