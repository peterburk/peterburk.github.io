<div2 type="chapter" n="49" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 49. (48.)—THE GREATEST LENGTH OF LIFE.</head><p>Not only the differences of climate, but the multitude ofinstances named, and the peculiar destiny attached to each ofus from the moment of his birth,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> tend to render one very uncertain in forming any general conclusion respecting the lengthand duration of human life. Hesiod, who was the first tomake mention of this subject, while he states many circumstances about the age of man, which appear to me to be fabulous, gives to the crow nine times the ordinary duration of ourlife, to the stag four times the length of that of the crow, tothe raven three times the length of that of the stag, besidesother particulars with reference to the phœnix and the Nymphsof a still more fabulous nature. The poet Anacreon gives<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>one hundred and fifty years to Arganthonius,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> the king of theTartessii; ten more to Cinaras,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> the king of Cyprus, and two<pb n="2201" />hundred to Ægimius.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> Theopompus gives one hundred andfifty-three years to Epimenides of Cnossus; according to Hellenicus, some of the nation of the Epii, in Ætolia, have completed their two hundredth year; and his account is confirmedby Damastes, who relates that Pictoreus, one of this nation,who was remarkable for his size and strength, lived even to histhree hundredth year. Ephorus says that some kings of Arcadia have lived three hundred years; Alexander Cornelius, thatthere was one Dandon, in Illyricum, who lived five hundred years.Xenophon, in his Periplus, gives to a king of the island ofthe Lutmii six hundred years, and, as though in that instancehe had lied too sparingly, to his son eight hundred.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> All thesestatements, however, have originated in a want of acquaintance with the accurate measurement of time. For some nationsreckon the summer as one year, and the winter as another;others again, consider each of the four seasons a year; theArcadians, for instance, whose years were of three months each.Others, such as the Egyptians, calculate by the moon, andhence it is that some individuals among them are said to havelived as many as one thousand years.</p><p>Let us proceed, however, to what is admitted to be true.It is pretty nearly certain, that Arganthonius of Gades<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> reignedeighty years, and he is supposed to have commenced his reignwhen he was forty. Masinissa, beyond a doubt, reignedsixty years,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> and Gorgias, the Sicilian, lived one hundred andunwittingly the father of Adonis, by his own daughter Myrrha (or Smyrna), in consequence of the anger of Venus or Aphrodite. He was saidto have founded the city of Cinyra in Cyprus.<pb n="2202" />eight.<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> Quintus Fabius Maximus was an augur for sixty-three years.<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> M. Perperna, and more recently, L. VolusiusSaturninus, survived all those whose suffrages each had solicitedon the occasion of his consulship;<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> Perperna lived ninety-eight years, and left after him only seven of those whosenames, when censor, he had enrolled. Connected with thisfact, it also suggests itself, and deserves to be remarked, thatit has happened only once, that five successive years haveever passed without the death of a senator taking place; thiswas the case from the occasion on which the censors Flaccusand Albinus performed the lustration, in the year of the City579, until the time of the succeeding censors.<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>. M. ValeriusCorvinus completed one hundred years, forty-six of which intervened between his first and sixth consulship.<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> He occupiedthe curule chair twenty-one times,<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> a thing that was neverthe case with any one besides. The pontiff Metellus also attained the same age.<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span></p><p>Among women also, Livia, the wife of Rutilius, exceededher ninety-sixth year; during the reign of Claudius, Statilia,a member of a noble family, died at the age of ninety-nine;Terentia, the wife of Cicero, lived one hundred and threeyears, and Clodia, the wife of Ofilius, one hundred and fifteen;she had fifteen children.<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span></p><p>Lucceia, an actress in the mimes, performed on the stage<pb n="2203" />when one hundred years old, and Galeria Copiola returned tothe stage, to perform in the interludes,<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> at the votive gameswhich were celebrated for the health of the deified Augustus, inthe consulship of C. Poppæus and Q. Sulpicius.<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> She hadmade her first appearance when eight years of age, just ninety-one years before that time, when M. Pomponius was ædile ofthe people, in the consulship of C. Marius and Cn. Carbo.<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> WhenPompeius Magnus dedicated his great theatre, he brought herupon the stage, as being quite a wonder, considering her oldage. Asconius Pedianus informs us, that Sammula also livedone hundred and ten years. I consider it less wonderful thatStephanio, who was the first to dance on the stage in comedydescriptive of Roman manners, should have<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> danced at thetwo secular games, those celebrated by the deified Augustus, and by Claudius Cæsar, in his fourth consulship, considering that the interval that elapsed between them was no morethan sixty-three years;<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> indeed, he lived a considerable timeafter the last period. We are informed by Mutianus, that, onthe peak of Mount Tmolus, which is called Tempsis, the peoplelive one hundred and fifty years, and that T. Fullonius, ofBononia, was set down as of the same age, in the registrationwhich took place under the censorship of Claudius Cæsar; andthis appeared to be confirmed by comparing the present withformer registrations, as well as many other proofs that hehad been alive at certain periods—for that prince greatly interested himself in ascertaining the exact truth of the matter.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny here alludes to the doctrine of astrology, which forms theespecial subject of the next Chapter.—B.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">These statements are not found in any of the works of Hesiod nowextant; it is scarcely necessary to observe, that they are entirely withoutfoundation, and contrary to all observation and experience.—B.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The great age of Arganthonius is referred to by Lucian, in his treatise"De Macrobiis," "on Long-lived Men;" by Herodotus, B. i. c. 163; byCicero, de Senect. sec. 19; and by Valerius Maximus, B. viii. c. 13; thethree latter writers agree in making his age 120 years, and hence Plinyassigns to him the same age in the next page.—B. St. Augustine, DeCivitate Dei, B. xv., quotes this passage of Pliny, and mentions the ageof Arganthonius, as stated by him, to have been 152 years.
