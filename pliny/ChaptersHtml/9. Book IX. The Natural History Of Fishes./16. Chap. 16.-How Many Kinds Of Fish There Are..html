<div2 type="chapter" n="16" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 16.—HOW MANY KINDS OF FISH THERE ARE.</head><p>There are seventy-four<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> species of fishes, exclusive of those<pb n="2382" />that are covered with crusts; the kinds of which are thirtyin number. We shall, on another occasion,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> speak of eachindividually; but, for the present, we shall treat only of thenature of the more remarkable ones.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hardouin suggests that the proper reading here is probably 144, because in B. xxxii. c. 51, Pliny speaks of 174 different kinds of fishes, andhere he says that the crustacea are thirty in number. Daubenton speaksof the species of fishes as being 866 in number, while Lacépede says thathe had examined more than a thousand, but that was far below the realnumber. Cuvier mentions specimens of about 6000 kinds of fishes, in theCabinet du Roi. Ajasson remarks upon the learned investigations ofCuvier on this subject, and his researches in Sumatra, Java, Kamschatka,New Zealand, New Guinea, and elsewhere, for the purpose of increasingthe list of the known kinds of fishes.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">B. xxx. c. 53.</p></body>
