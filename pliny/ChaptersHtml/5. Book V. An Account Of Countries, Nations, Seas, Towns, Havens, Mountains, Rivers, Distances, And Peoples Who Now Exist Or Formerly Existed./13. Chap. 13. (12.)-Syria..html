<div2 type="chapter" n="13" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 13. (12.)—SYRIA.</head><p>Next to these countries Syria occupies the coast, once thegreatest of lands, and distinguished by many names; for thepart which joins up to Arabia was formerly called Palæstina,Judæa, Cœle<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>, and Phœnice. The country in the interiorwas called Damascena, and that further on and more to thesouth, Babylonia. The part that lies between the Euphrates<pb n="1424" />and the Tigris was called Mesopotamia, that beyond TaurusSophene, and that on this side of the same chain Comagene.Beyond Armenia was the country of Adiabene, ancientlycalled Assyria, and at the part where it joins up to Cilicia,it was called Antiochia. Its length, between Cilicia andArabia<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>, is 470 miles, and its breadth, from Seleucia Pieria<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> toZeugma<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, a town on the Euphrates, 175. Those who makea still more minute division of this country will have it thatPhœnice is surrounded by Syria, and that first comes themaritime coast of Syria, part of which is Idumæa and Judæa,after that Phœnice, and then Syria. The whole of the tractof sea that lies in front of these shores is called the PhœnicianSea. The Phœnician people enjoy the glory of havingbeen the inventors of letters<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>, and the first discoverers of thesciences of astronomy, navigation, and the art of war.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or the "Hollow" Syria. This was properly the name given, after the Macedonian conquest, to the great valley between the two great ranges of Mount Lebanon, in the south of Syria, bordering upon Phœnicia on the west, and Palestine on the south. In the wars between the Ptolemies and the Seleucidæ, the name was applied to the whole of the southern portion of Syria, which became subject for some time to the kings of Egypt; but under the Romans, it was confined to Cœlesyria proper with the district east of Anti-Libanus, about Damascus, and a portion of Palestine east of Jordan.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or Ostracine, the northern point of Arabia.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This was a great fortress of Syria founded by Seleucus B.C. <date value="-300" authname="-300">300</date>, at the foot of Mount Pieria and overhanging the Mediterranean, four miles north of the Orontes and twelve miles west of Antioch. It had fallen entirely to decay in the sixth century of our era. There are considerable ruins of its harbour and mole, its walls and necropolis. They bear the name of Seleukeh or Kepse.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From the Greek <foreign lang="greek">zeu=gma,</foreign> "a junction ;" built by Seleucus Nicator on the borders of Commagene and Cyrrhestice, on the west bank of the Euphrates, where the river had been crossed by a bridge of boats constructed by Alexander the Great. The modern Rumkaleh is supposed to occupy its site.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">On this subject see B. vii. c. 57. The invention of letters and the first cultivation of the science of astronomy have been claimed for the Egyptians and other nations. The Tyrians were probably the first who applied the science of astronomy to the purposes of navigation. There is little doubt that warfare must have been studied as an art long before the existence of the Phœnician nation.</p></body>
