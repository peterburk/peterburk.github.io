<div2 type="chapter" n="24" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 24. (20.)—THE ALPS, AND THE ALPINE NATIONS.</head><p>Many nations dwell among the Alps; but the moreremarkable, between Pola and the district of Tergeste, arethe Secusses, the Subocrini, the Catali, the Menocaleni, andnear the Carni the people formerly called the Taurisci, butnow the Norici. Adjoining to these are the Rhæti and theVindelici, who are all divided into a multitude of states. Itis supposed that the Rhæti are the descendants of the Tuscans, whowere expelled by the Gauls and migrated hitherunder the command of their chief, whose name was Rhætus.Turning then to the side of the Alps which fronts Italy, wehave the Euganean<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> nations enjoying Latin rights, and ofwhom Cato enumerates thirty-four towns. Among these arethe Triumpilini, a people who were sold<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> with their territory; andthen the Camuni, and several similar tribes, eachof them in the jurisdiction of its neighbouring municipaltown. The same author also considers the Lepontii<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and<pb n="1255" />the Salassi to be of Tauriscan origin, but most otherwriters, giving a Greek<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> interpretation to their name, consider the Lepontii to have been those of the followers ofHercules who were left behind in consequence of their limbsbeing frozen by the snow of the Alps. They are also ofopinion that the inhabitants of the Grecian Alps are descended from a portion of the Greeks of his army, and thatthe Euganeans, being sprung from an origin so illustrious,thence took their name<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>. The head of these are the Stœni<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>.The Vennonenses<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> and the Sarunetes<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>, peoples of theRhæti, dwell about the sources of the river Rhenus, whilethe tribe of the Lepontii, known as the Uberi, dwell in thevicinity of the sources of the lhodanus, in the same districtof the Alps. There are also other native tribes here,who have received Latin rights, such as the Octodurenses<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>,and their neighbours the Centrones<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>, the Cottian<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> states,the Ligurian Vagienni, descended from the Caturiges<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>, asalso those called Montani<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>; besides numerous nations of theCapillati<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>, on the confines of the Ligurian Sea.<pb n="1256" /></p><p>It may not be inappropriate in this place to subjoin theinscription now to be seen upon the trophy<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> erected on theAlps, which is to the following effect:—"To the EmperorCæsar—The son<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> of Cæsar now deified, Augustus,Pontifex Maximus, and emperor fourteen years, inthe seventeenth<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> year of his holding the tribuni-tial authority, the Senate and the Roman people, inremembrance that under his command and auspicesall the Alpine nations which extended from theupper sea to the lower were reduced to subjectionby the Roman people—The Alpine nations so sub-dued were: the Triumpilini, the Camuni, the Ve-nostes<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span>, the Vennonenses, the Isarci, the Breuni,the Genaunes<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span>, the Focunates, four nations of theVindelici, the Consuanetes, the Rucinates, theLicates<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span>, the Catenates, the Ambisontes, the Ru-gusci, the Suanetes<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span>, the Calucones, the Brixentes, the Lepontii, the Uberi, the Nantuates, theSeduni, the Varagri, the Salassi, the Acitavones,<pb n="1257" />the Medulli, the Uceni<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span>, the Caturiges, the Bri-giani, the Sogiontii, the Brodiontii, the Nemaloni,the Edenates<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span>, the Esubiani, the Veamini, the Gal-litæ, the Triulatti, the Ecdini, the Vergunni, theEguituri<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span>, the Nementuri, the Oratelli, the Nerusi,the Velauni, and the Suetri."</p><p>The twelve states of the Cottiani<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span> were not included inthe list, as they had shown no hostility, nor yet those whichhad been placed by the Pompeian law under the jurisdictionof the municipal towns.</p><p>Such then is Italy, sacred to the gods, such are the nations, suchthe cities of her peoples; to which we may add,that this is that same Italy, which, when L. Æmilius Paulus<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span>and C. Attilius Regulus were Consuls, on hearing of the risingin Gaul, unaided, and without any foreign assistance whatever,without the help even of that portion which lies beyond thePadus, armed 80,000 horse and 700,000 foot. In abundance of metals ofevery kind. Italy yields to no land whatever;but all search for them has been prohibited by an ancientdecree of the Senate, who gave orders thereby that Italyshall be exempted<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span> from such treatment.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is from this people that the group of volcanichills between Paduaand Verona derive their present name of Colli Euganei or the "EuganeanHills."

These states, in the vicinity ofthe modern Mount Cenis, seem to have extended from Ebrodunum or Embrunin Gaul, to Segusio, the modern Susa, in Italy, including the Pass ofMont Grenèvre. The territory of Cottius was united by Nero to theRoman empire, as a separate province called the "Alpes Cottiæ."</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">They dwelt in the vicinity of Ebrodunum or Embrun already mentioned.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The "mountaineers."

The Brixentesinhabited the modern Brixen in the Tyrol. The Lepontii have beenpreviously mentioned. The Seduni occupied the present Sion, thecapitalof the Valais. The Salassi have been already mentioned. According toBouche, the Medulli occupied the modern Maurienne in Savoy. TheVaragri dwelt in Le Chablais.</p><p><span id="note_22"><a href="#ref_22">22. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Uceni, according to Hardouin, occupied Le Bourg d'Oysans inthe modern Graisivaudan; the Caturiges, the modern Chorges accordingto Ansart; the Brigiani, probably Briançon, and the Nemaloni, asHardouin thinks, the place called Miolans.</p><p><span id="note_23"><a href="#ref_23">23. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">They probably dwelt in the Ville de Seyne, in Embrun; the Esubianinear the river Hubaye, in the Vallée de Barcelone in Savoy; the Veaminiin Senez, the Triulatti at the village of Alloz, the Ecdini near the riverTinea, and the Vergunni in the vicinity of the district of Vergons.</p><p><span id="note_24"><a href="#ref_24">24. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Eguituri probably dwelt near the modern town of Guillaumes, theOratelli at the place now called Le Puget de Théniers, and theVelauninear the modern Bueil.</p><p><span id="note_25"><a href="#ref_25">25. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or subjects of Cottius, previously mentioned.</p><p><span id="note_26"><a href="#ref_26">26. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A mistake for L. Æmilus Papus. He and C. Regulus were Consulsin B.C. <date value="-225" authname="-225">225</date>. They successfully opposed the Cisalpine Gauls,who invadedItaly; but Regulus was slain in the engagement.</p><p><span id="note_27"><a href="#ref_27">27. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is difficult to say what is the exact force of "parci" here; whetherin fact it means that Italy shall be wholly exempted from such treatment,as an indignity offered to her soil, or whether her minerals were to bestrictly kept in reserve as a last resource. Ajasson, in his Translation,seems to take the former view, Littré the latter.</p></body>
