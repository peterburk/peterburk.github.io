<div2 type="chapter" n="74" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 74. (31.)ÑTHE VINTAGE, AND THE WORKS OF AUTUMN.</head><p>In accordance with the ordinary divisions of the year, wenow come to autumn, a period which extends from the settingof the Lyre to the autumnal equinox, and from that to thesetting of the Vergili¾ and the beginning of winter. In theseintervals, the more important periods are marked by the risingof the Horse to the people of Attica, in the evening of the daybefore<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> the ides of August; upon which day also the Dolphinsets in Egypt, and, according to C¾sar, in Italy. On theeleventh<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> before the calends of September, the star called theVintager begins to rise in the morning, according to C¾sar'sreckoning, and to the people of Assyria; it announces theripening of the vintage, a sure sign of which is the change ofcolour in the grape. On the fifth<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> before the calends ofSeptember, the Arrow sets in Assyria, and the Etesian winds ceaseto blow: on the nones<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> of September, the Vintager rises inEgypt, and in the morning of that day, Arcturus rises to thepeople of Attica: on the same morning, too, the Arrow sets.On the fifth before<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> the ides of September, according to C¾sar,the She-Goat rises in the evening; and one half of Arcturusbecomes visible on the day before<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> the ides of September, beingportentous<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> of boisterous weather for five days, both by landand sea.</p><p>The theory relative to the effects produced by Arcturus, isstated in the following terms: if showers prevail, it is said, atthe setting of the Dolphin, they will not cease so long asArcturus is visible. The departure of the swallows may be<pb n="4108" />looked upon as the sign of the rising of Arcturus; for if overtakenby it, they are sure to perish.</p><p>On the sixteenth day before<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> the calends of October, theEar of Corn, which Virgo holds, rises to the people of Egypt inthe morning, and by this day the Etesian winds have quiteceased to blow. According to C¾sar, this constellation rises onthe fourteenth<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> before the calends, and it affords its prognosticsto the Assyrians on the thirteenth. On the eleventh before<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>the calends of October, the point of junction<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> in Piscesdisappears, and upon the eighth<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> is the autumnal equinox. It isa remarkable fact, and rarely the case, that Philippus, Callip-pus, Dositheus, Parmeniscus, Conon,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> Criton, Democritus, andEudoxus, all agree that the She-Goat rises in the morning ofthe fourth before<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> the calends of October, and on the third<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>the Kids. On the sixth day before<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> the nones of October, theCrown rises in the morning to the people of Attica, and uponthe morning of the fifth,<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> the Charioteer sets. On the fourthbefore<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> the nones of October, the Crown, according to C¾sar'sreckoning, begins to rise, and on the evening of the day afteris the setting of the constellation of the Kids. On the eighthbefore<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> the ides of October, according to C¾sar, the brightstar rises that shines in the Crown, and on the evening of thesixth before<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> the ides the Vergili¾, rise. Upon the ides<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> ofOctober, the Crown has wholly risen. On the seventeenth before<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span>the calends of November, the Sucul¾ rise in the evening,and on the day before the calends, according to C¾sar's reckoning,Arcturus sets, and the Sucul¾<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span> rise with the sun. In theevening of the fourth day before<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span> the nones of November,Arcturus sets. On the fifth before<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span> the ides of November,Orion's Sword begins to set; and on the third<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span> before theides the Vergili¾ set.<pb n="4109" /></p><p>In this interval of time, the rural operations consist in sowingrape and turnips, upon the days which have been mentioned ona previous occasion.<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span> The people in the country are of opinion,that it is not a good plan to sow rape after the departure of thestork; but for my own part, I am of opinion that it shouldbe sown after the Vulcanalia, and the early kind at the sametime as panic. After the setting of the Lyre, vetches shouldbe sown, kidney-beans and hay-grass: it is generally recommended thatthis should be done while the moon is in conjunction. This, too, isthe proper time for gathering in theleaves: it is fair work for one woodman, to fill four baskets<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span>in the day. If the leaves are gathered while the moon is onthe wane, they will not decay; they ought not to be dry,however, when gathered.</p><p>The ancients were of opinion, that the vintage is never ripebefore the equinox; but at the present day I find that it isgathered in before that period; it will be as well, therefore,to give the signs and indications by which the proper momentmay be exactly ascertained. The rules for getting in the vintage areto the following effect: Never gather the grape in aheated state,<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span> or in other words, when the weather is dry, andbefore the rains have fallen; nor ought it to be gathered whencovered with dew,Ñor in other words, when dews have fallenduring the night,Ñnor yet before the dews have been dispelledby the sun. Commence the vintage when the bearing-shootsbegin to recline upon the stem, or when, after a grape is removedfrom the bunch, the space left empty is not filled up;this being a sure proof that the berry has ceased to increase insize. It is of the greatest consequence to the grape, that itshould be gathered while the moon is on the increase. Eachpressing should fill twenty culei,<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span> that being the fairproportion. To fill twenty culei and vats<span id="ref_31"><a href="#note_31">[31]</a></span> from twenty jugera ofvineyard, a single press will be enough. In pressing the grape,some persons use a single press-board, but it is a better plan<pb n="4110" />to employ two, however large the single ones may be. It is thelength of them that is of the greatest consequence, and not thethickness: if wide, however, they press the fruit all the better.The ancients used to screw down the press-boards with ropesand leather thongs, worked by levers. Within the last hundredyears the Greek press has been invented, with thick spiralgrooves running down the<span id="ref_32"><a href="#note_32">[32]</a></span> stem. To this stem there arespokes attached, which project like the rays of a star, and bymeans of which the stem is made to lift a box filled with stonesÑa method that is very highly approved of. It is only withinthe last two-and-twenty years, that a plan has been discoveredof employing smaller press-boards, and a less unwieldy press:to effect this, the height has been reduced, and the stem of thescrew placed in the middle, the whole pressure being concentratedupon broad planks<span id="ref_33"><a href="#note_33">[33]</a></span> placed over the grapes, which arecovered also with heavy weights above.</p><p>This is the proper time for gathering fruit; the best momentfor doing so is when it has begun to fall through ripeness,and not from the effects of the weather. This is the season,too, for extracting the lees of wine, and for boiling defrutum:<span id="ref_34"><a href="#note_34">[34]</a></span>this last must be done on a night when there is no moon, or ifit is a full moon, in the day-time. At other times of the year,it must be done either before the moon has risen, or after ithas set. The grapes employed for this purpose should neverbe gathered from a young vine, nor yet from a tree that isgrown in a marshy spot, nor should any grapes be used butthose that are perfectly ripe: the liquor, too, should never beskimmed with anything but a leaf;<span id="ref_35"><a href="#note_35">[35]</a></span> for if the vessel shouldhappen to be touched with wood, the liquor, it is generallythought, will have a burnt and smoky flavour.</p><p>The proper time for the vintage is between the equinox andthe setting of the Vergili¾, a period of forty-four days. It isa saying among the growers, that to pitch wine-vessels afterthat day, in consequence of the coldness of the weather, is onlyso much time lost. Still, however, I have seen, before now,persons getting in the vintage on the calends of January<span id="ref_36"><a href="#note_36">[36]</a></span><pb n="4111" />even, in consequence of the want of wine-vessels, and puttingthe must into receivers,<span id="ref_37"><a href="#note_37">[37]</a></span> or else pouring the old wine out ofits vessels, to make room for new liquor of a very doubtfulquality. This, however, happens not so often in consequenceof an over-abundant crop, as through carelessness, or else theavarice which leads people to wait for a rise in prices. Themethod that is adopted by the most economical managers, isto use the produce supplied by each year,<span id="ref_38"><a href="#note_38">[38]</a></span> and this, too, isfound in the end the most lucrative mode of proceeding. Asfor the other details relative to wines, they have been discussedat sufficient length already;<span id="ref_39"><a href="#note_39">[39]</a></span> and it has been stated on aprevious occasion,<span id="ref_40"><a href="#note_40">[40]</a></span> that as soon as the vintage is got in,the olivesshould at once be gathered, with other particulars relativeto the olive after the setting of the Vergili¾.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Twelfth of August.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Twenty-second of August.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Twenty-eighth of August.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Fifth of September.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ninth of September.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Twelfth of September.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See the Rudens of Plautus, Prol. 1. 69.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Sixteenth of September.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Eighteenth of September.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Twenty-first of September.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Commissura.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Twenty-fourth of September.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Mentioned by Virgil, Eccl. iii. 1. 38, and by Propertius, Eleg. iv. 1.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Twenty-eighth of September.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Twenty-ninth of September.</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Second of October.</p><p><span id="note_17"><a href="#ref_17">17. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Third of October.</p><p><span id="note_18"><a href="#ref_18">18. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Fourth of October.</p><p><span id="note_19"><a href="#ref_19">19. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Eighth of October.</p><p><span id="note_20"><a href="#ref_20">20. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Tenth of October.</p><p><span id="note_21"><a href="#ref_21">21. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Fifteenth of October.</p><p><span id="note_22"><a href="#ref_22">22. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Sixteenth of October.</p><p><span id="note_23"><a href="#ref_23">23. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or Hyades, see C. 66.</p><p><span id="note_24"><a href="#ref_24">24. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Second of November.</p><p><span id="note_25"><a href="#ref_25">25. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ninth of November.</p><p><span id="note_26"><a href="#ref_26">26. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Eleventh of November.</p><p><span id="note_27"><a href="#ref_27">27. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In c. 35 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_28"><a href="#ref_28">28. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Frondarias fiscinas."
