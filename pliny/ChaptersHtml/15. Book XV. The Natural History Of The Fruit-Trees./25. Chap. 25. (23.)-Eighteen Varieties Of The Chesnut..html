(23.)—EIGHTEEN VARIETIES OF THE CHESNUT.</head><p>We give the name of nut, too, to the chesnut,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> although itwould seem more properly to belong to the acorn tribe. Thechesnut has its armour of defence in a shell bristling withprickles like the hedge-hog, an envelope which in the acornis only partially developed. It is really surprising, however,that Nature should have taken such pains thus to conceal anobject of so little value. We sometimes find as many asthree nuts beneath a single outer shell. The skin<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> of the nutis limp and flexible: there is a membrane, too, which liesnext to the body of the fruit, and which, both in this and inthe walnut, spoils the flavour if not taken off, Chesnuts arethe most pleasant eating when roasted:<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> they are sometimesground also, and are eaten by women when fasting for religious scruples,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> as bearing some resemblance to bread. It isfrom Sardes<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> that the chesnut was first introduced, and henceit is that the Greeks have given it the name of the "Sardianacorn;" for the name "Dios balanon"<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> was given at a laterperiod, after it had been considerably improved by cultivation.</p><p>At the present day there are numerous varieties of thechesnut. Those of Tarentum are a light food, and by nomeans difficult of digestion; they are of a flat shape. Thereis a rounder variety, known as the "balanitis;"<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> it is veryeasily peeled, and springs clean out of the shell, so to say, of<pb n="3319" />its own accord. The Salarian<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> chesnut has a smooth outershell, while that of Tarentum is not so easily handled.<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> TheCorellian is more highly esteemed, as is the Etereian, which isan offshoot from it produced by a method upon which we shallhave to enlarge when we come to speak of grafting.<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> Thislast has a red skin,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> which causes it to be preferred to thethree-cornered chesnut and our black common sorts, whichare known as "coctivæ."<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> Tarentum and Neapolis in Campania are the most esteemed localities for the chesnut: otherkinds, again, are grown to feed pigs upon,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> the skin of whichis rough and folded inwards, so as to penetrate to the heart ofthe kernel.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The tree is the Fagus castanea of Linnæus.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cortex.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The common mode of eating it at the present day.
