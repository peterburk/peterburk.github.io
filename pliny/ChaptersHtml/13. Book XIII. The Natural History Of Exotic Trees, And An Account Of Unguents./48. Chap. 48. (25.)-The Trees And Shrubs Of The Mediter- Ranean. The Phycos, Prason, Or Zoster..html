Noother language has any name for the shrub which is known tothe Greeks as the "phycos,"<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> since by the word "alga"<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> a<pb n="3210" />mere herb is generally understood, while the "phycos" is acomplete shrub. This plant has a broad leaf of a green colour, which is by some called "prason,"<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> and by others isknown as "zoster."<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> Another kind,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> again, has a hairy sortof leaf, very similar to fennel, and grows upon rocks, whilethat previously mentioned grows in shoaly spots, not far fromthe shore. Both kinds shoot in the spring, and die in autumn.<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>The phycos<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> which grows on the rocks in the neighbourhoodof Crete, is used also for dyeing purple; the best kind beingthat produced on the north side of the island, which is thecase also with sponges of the very best quality. A third kind,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>again, is similar in appearance to grass; the root of it isknotted, and so is the stalk, which resembles that of a reed.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He alludes to various kinds of fucus or sea-weed, which grows to amuch larger size in the Eastern seas.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Mediterranean.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Whence the word "fucus" of the naturalists.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">FŽe suggests that this may be the Laminaria saccharina of Linn¾us,being one of the "ulv¾" often thrown up on the coasts of Europe.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The "green" plant.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The "girdle" plant.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Fucus barbatus, probably, of Linn¾us, or else the Fucus ero•des.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">They are in reality more long-lived than this.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">FŽe suggests that it is the Roccella tinctoria of Linn¾us.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Zostera marina of Linn¾us, according to FŽe .</p></body>
