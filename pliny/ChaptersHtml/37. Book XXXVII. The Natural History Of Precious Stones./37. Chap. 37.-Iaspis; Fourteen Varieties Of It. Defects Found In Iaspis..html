<div2 type="chapter" n="37" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 37.—IASPIS; FOURTEEN VARIETIES OF IT. DEFECTS FOUNDIN IASPIS.</head><p>Iaspis,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> too, is green, and often transparent; a stone which, ifsurpassed by many others, still retains the renown which itacquired in former times. Many countries produce this stone:that of India is like smaragdus in colour; that of Cyprus ishard, and of a full sea-green; and that of Persia is sky-blue,whence its name, "aërizusa."<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> Similar to this last is theCaspian iaspis. On the banks of the river Thermodon theiaspis is of an azure colour; in Phrygia, it is purple; and inCappadocia of an azure purple, sombre, and not refulgent.Amisos<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> sends us an iaspis like that of India in colour, andChalcedon,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> a stone of a turbid hue.</p><p>But it is of less consequence to distinguish the several localitiesthat furnish it, than it is to remark upon the degrees ofexcellence which they present. The best kind is that whichhas a shade of purple, the next best being the rose-coloured,and the next the stone with the green colour of the smaragdus;to each of which the Greeks have given names<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> according totheir respective tints. A fourth kind, which is called by them"boria,"<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> resembles in colour the sky of a morning in autumn;this, too, will be the same that is known as "aërizusa."<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> Thereis an iaspis also which resembles sarda<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> in appearance, andanother with a violet tint. Not less numerous, too, are theother kinds that are left undescribed; but they are all blue toa fault,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> or else resemble crystal in appearance, or the tints ofthe myxa<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> plum. There is the terebenthine<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>-coloured iaspisalso; improperly so called, in my opinion, as it has all the appearanceof being a composition of numerous gems of this description.</p><p>The best of these stones are set in an open bezel, the gold of<pb n="6431" />which only embraces the margins of the stone, leaving theupper and lower surfaces uncovered. One great defect inthem is a subdued lustre, and a want of refulgence whenviewed from a distance. Grains also like salt appear within thestone, and all the other defects which are common<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> to preciousstones in general. Sometimes they are imitated in glass; a fraud,however, which may be easily detected, from the materialthrowing out its refulgence, instead of concentrating it withinitself. To this class also belongs the stone called "sphragis,"<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>which is only reckoned as belonging to the domain of preciousstones, from the circumstance that it is the best of all formaking signets.<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span></p><p>(9.) Throughout all the East, it is the custom, it is said, towear iaspis by way of amulet. The variety of this stonewhich resembles smaragdus in colour is often found with awhite line running transversely through the middle; in whichcase it is known as "monogrammos:"<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> when it is streakedwith several lines, it is called "polygrammos."<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> Here, too, Imay take the opportunity of exposing the falsehoods<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> of themagicians, who pretend that this stone is beneficial for personswhen speaking in public. There is a stone also that is formed ofiaspis and onyx combined, and is known as "iasponyx."<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> Sometimesthis stone has a clouded appearance; sometimes it hasspots upon the surface like snow;<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> and sometimes it is stellatedwith red spots.<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> One kind resembles salt of Megara<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> inappearance, and another is known as capnias,<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> and looks as ifit had been smoked. We have seen in our day an iaspis<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span><pb n="6432" />fifteen inches in length, of which a figure of Nero was made,armed with a cuirass.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Meadow-green jasper</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Salmasius erroneously takes this to be the Turquoise.
