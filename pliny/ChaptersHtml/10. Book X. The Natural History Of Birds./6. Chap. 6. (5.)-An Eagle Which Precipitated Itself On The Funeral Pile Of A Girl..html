(5.)ÑAN EAGLE WHICH PRECIPITATED ITSELF ON THEFUNERAL PILE OF A GIRL.</head><p>There is a very famous story about an eagle at the city ofSestos. Having been reared by a little girl, it used to testifyits gratitude for her kindness, first by bringing her birds, andin due time various kinds of prey: at last she died, upon whichthe bird threw itself on the lighted pile, and was consumedwith her body. In memory of this event, the inhabitantsraised upon the spot what they called an heroic monument,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>in honour of Jupiter and the damsel, the eagle being a birdconsecrated to that divinity.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Heroum."</p></body>
