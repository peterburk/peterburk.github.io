<div2 type="chapter" n="18" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 18.—THE NATURE OF THE SAD THROWN BY TREES.</head><p>The shadows of trees are possessed of certain properties.That of the walnut is baneful<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and injurious to man, in whomit is productive of head-ache, and it is equally noxious toeverything that grows in its vicinity. The shadow, too, ofthe pine has the effect of killing<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> the grass beneath it; butin both of these trees the foliage presents an effectual resistance to the winds, while, at the same time, the vine is destitute of such protection.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> The drops of water that fall fromthe pine, the quercus, and the holm-oak are extremely heavy,but from the cypress none fall; the shadow, too, thrown bythis last tree is extremely small, its foliage being denselypacked.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> The shadow of the fig, although widely spread, isbut light, for which reason it is allowed to be planted amongvines. The shadow of the elm is refreshing and even nutrimental to whatever it may happen to cover; though, in theopinion of Atticus, this tree is one of the most injurious ofthem all; and, indeed, I have no doubt that such may be thecase when the branches are allowed to become too long;but at the same time I am of opinion that when they arekept short it can be productive of no possible harm. Theplane also gives a very pleasant shade,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> though somewhatdense: but in this case we must look more to the luxuriantsoftness of the grass beneath it than the warmth of the sun;for there is no tree that forms a more verdant couch on whichto recline.</p><p>The poplar<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> gives no shade whatever, in consequence of the<pb n="3474" />incessant quivering of its leaves: while that of the alder is verydense, but remarkably nutritive to plants. The vine affordssufficient shade for its wants, the leaf being always in motion,and from its repeated movement tempering the heat of the sunwith the shadow that it affords; at the same time too itserves as an effectual protection against heavy rains. Innearly all trees the shade is thin, where the footstalks of theleaves are long.</p><p>This branch of knowledge is one by no means to be despisedor deserving to be placed in the lowest rank, for in the case ofevery variety of plant the shade is found to act either as akind nurse or a harsh step-mother. There is no doubt thatthe shadow of the walnut, the pine, the pitch-tree, and the firis poisonous to everything it may chance to light upon.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xv. c. 24.
