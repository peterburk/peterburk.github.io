<div2 type="chapter" n="82" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 82. (56.)—WHO INVENTED PRESERVES FOR SEA-SNAILS.</head><p>Fulvius Lupinus<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> first formed preserves for sea-snails,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> inthe territory of Tarquinii, shortly before the civil war betweenCæsar and Pompeius Magnus. He also carefully distinguishedthem by their several species, separating them from one another.The white ones were those that are produced in the districtof Reate;<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> those of Illyria were remarkable for the largenessof their size; while those from Africa were the most prolific;those, however, from the Promontory of the Sun<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> were themost esteemed of all. For the purpose, also, of fattening them,lie invented a mixture of boiled wine,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> spelt-meal, and othersubstances; so that fattened periwinkles even became quite anobject of gastronomy; and the art of breeding them was broughtto such a pitch of perfection, that the shell of a single animalwould hold as much as eighty quadrantes.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> This we learnfrom M. Varro.<pb n="2471" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hirpinius is the more common reading. He is mentioned in B. viii.c. 78. If the reading "Lupinus" is adopted, nothing seems to be knownof this epicurean trifler.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Our periwinkles.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. iii. c. 17.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Off the coast of Africa, see B. v. c. 1. These periwinkles, or sea-snails, are again mentioned in B. xxx. c. 15.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Sapa." Must, or new wine, boiled down to one half, according toPliny; and one third, according to Varro.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The "quadrans" contained three cyathi, and was the fourth part ofa sextarius, which consisted of about a pint and a-half; in which case thecontents of one of their shells would be no less than fifteen quarts!! Astatement to which no credit can be attached, unless, indeed, the sea-snailwas something quite different to our periwinkle.</p></body>
