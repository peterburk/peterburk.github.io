<div2 type="chapter" n="60" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 60. (27.)—OMPHACIUM.</head><p>Omphacium<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> is also a kind of oil, which is obtained from<pb n="3154" />two trees, the olive and the vine, by two different methods.It is produced from the former by pressing the olive while itis still in the white state. That is of an inferior quality whichis made from the druppa—such being the name that is givento the olive before it is ripe and fit for food, but alreadybeginning to change its colour. The difference between themis, that the latter kind is green, the former white. The omphacium that is made from the vine is extracted from eitherthe psythian<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> or the Aminean grape, when the grapes areabout the size of a chick-pea, just before the rising of the Dogstar. The grape is gathered when the first bloom is appearingupon it, and the verjuice is extracted, after which the residue<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>is left to dry in the sun, due precautions being taken againstthe dews of the night. The verjuice, after being collected, isput into earthen vessels, and then, after that, stored in jarsof Cyprian copper.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> The best kind is that which is of areddish colour, acrid, and dry to the taste? The price atwhich it sells is six denarii per pound. Omphacium is alsomade another way—the unripe grape is pounded in a mortar,after which it is dried in the sun, and then divided intolozenges.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From the Greek <foreign lang="greek">o)mfa/kion,</foreign> being made of unripe grapes. As Féeremarks, that made from the olive is correctly described as a kind of oil,but that made from the grape must have been a rob, or pure verjuice.These two liquids must have had totally different qualities, and resembledeach other in nothing but the name. That extracted from the olive ismentioned again in B. xxiii. c. 4, in reference to its medicinal properties.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">These grapes are described in B. xiv. c. 4 and c. 11.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Reliquum corpus."
