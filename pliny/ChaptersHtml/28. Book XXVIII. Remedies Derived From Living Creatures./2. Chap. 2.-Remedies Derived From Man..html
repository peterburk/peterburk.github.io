<div2 type="chapter" n="2" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 2.—REMEDIES DERIVED FROM MAN.</head><p>We will begin then with man, and our first enquires willbe into the resources which he provides for himself-a subjectreplete with boundless difficulties at the very outset.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span></p><p>Epileptic patients are in the habit of drinking the bloodeven of gladiators, draughts teeming with life,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> as it were; athing that, when we see it done by the wild beasts even, uponthe same arena, inspires us with horror at the spectacle! Andyet these persons, forsooth, consider it a most effectual curefor their disease, to quaff the warm, breathing, blood from manhimself, and, as they apply their mouth to the wound, to drawforth his very life; and this, though it is regarded as an actof impiety to apply the human lips to the wound even of awild beast! Others there are, again, who make the marrow<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>of the leg-bones, and the brains of infants, the objects of theirresearch!</p><p>Among the Greek writers, too, there are not a few who haveenlarged upon the distinctive flavours of each one of the visceraand members of the human body, pursuing their researchesto the very parings of the nails! as though, forsooth, it could<pb n="5277" />possibly be accounted the pursuit of health for man to makehimself a wild beast, and so deserve to contract disease fromthe very remedies he adopts for avoiding it. Most righteously,by Hercules! if such attempts are all in vain, is he disappointed of his cure! To examine human entrails is deemedan act of impiety;<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> what then must it be to devour them?</p><p>Say, Osthanes,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> who was it that first devised these practices;for it is thee that I accuse, thou uprooter of all human laws,thou inventor of these monstrosities; devised, no doubt, withthe view that mankind might not forget thy name! Who wasit that first thought of devouring each member of the humanbody? By what conjectural motives was he induced? Whatcan possibly have been the origin of such a system of medicine asthis? Who was it that thus made the very poisons less banefulthan the antidotes prescribed for them? Granted that barbarousand outlandish tribes first devised such practices, must themen of Greece, too, adopt these as arts of their own?</p><p>We read, for instance, in the memoirs of Democritus, stillextant, that for some diseases, the skull of a malefactor is mostefficacious, while for the treatment of others, that of one whohas been a friend or guest is required. Apollonius, again, informs us in his writings, that the most effectual remedy fortooth-ache is to scarify the gums with the tooth of a man whohas died a violent death; and, according to Miletus, human gallis a cure for cataract.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> For epilepsy, Artemon has prescribedwater drawn from a spring in the night, and drunk from theskull of a man who has been slain, and whose body remainsunburnt. From the skull, too, of a man who had been hanged,Antæus made pills that were to be an antidote to. the bite of;mad dog. Even more than this, man has resorted to similar remedies for the cure of four-footed beasts even—for tympanitis inoxen, for instance, the horns have been perforated, and humanbones inserted; and when swine have been found to be diseased,<pb n="5278" />fine wheat has been given them which has lain for a night inthe spot where a human being has been slain or burnt!</p><p>Far from us, far too from our writings, be such prescriptions<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> as these! It will be for us to describe remedies only,and not abominations;<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> cases, for instance, in which the milkof a nursing woman may have a curative effect, cases wherethe human spittle may be useful, or the contact<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> of the humanbody, and other instances of a similar nature. We do not lookupon life as so essentially desirable that it must be prolongedat any cost, be it what it may—and you, who are of thatopinion, be assured, whoever you may be, that you will dienone the less, even though you shall have lived in the midstof obscenities or abominations!</p><p>Let each then reckon this as one great solace to his mind,that of all the blessings which Nature has bestowed on man,there is none greater than the death<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> which comes at a seasonable hour; and that the very best feature in connexion with itis, that every person has it in his own power to procure it forhimself.<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxviii. c. 3.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This practice is mentioned with reprobation by Celsus and Tertullian.It was continued, however, in some degree through the middle ages, andLouis XV. was accused by his people of taking baths of infants' blood torepair his premature decrepitude.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In recent times, Guettard, a French practitioner, recommended humanmarrow as an emollient liniment.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hence, as Ajasson remarks, the ignorance of anatomy displayed by theancients.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">For further particulars as to Osthanes, see B. xxix. c. 80, and B. xxx.cc. 5 and 6; also cc. 19 and 77 of the present Book.
