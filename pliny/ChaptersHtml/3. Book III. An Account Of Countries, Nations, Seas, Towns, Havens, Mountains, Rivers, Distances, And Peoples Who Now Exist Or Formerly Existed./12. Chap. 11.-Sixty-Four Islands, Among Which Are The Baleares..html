<div2 type="chapter" n="11" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 11.—SIXTY-FOUR ISLANDS, AMONG WHICH ARE THE BALEARES.</head><p>The first islands that we meet with in all these seas are<pb n="1211" />the two to which the Greeks have given the name of Pityussæ<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>,from the pine-tree<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>, which they produce. These islands nowbear the name of Ebusus, and form a federate state. Theyare separated by a narrow strait<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> of the sea, and are forty-six<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>miles in extent. They are distant from Dianium<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> 700 stadia,Dianium being by land the same distance<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> from New Carthage. At the same distance<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> from the Pityussæ, lie, in theopen sea, the two Baleares, and, over against the river Sucro<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>,Colubraria<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>. The Baleares<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>, so formidable in war withtheir slingers<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>, have received from the Greeks the name ofGymnasiæ.</p><p>The larger island is 100<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> miles in length, and 475 in circumference. It has the following towns; Palma<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> and Pollentia<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>, enjoying the rights of Roman citizens, Cinium<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> andTucis, with Latin rights: Bocchorum, a federate town, isno longer in existence. At thirty miles' distance is the<pb n="1212" />smaller island, 40 miles in length, and 150<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> in circumference;it contains the states of Jamnon<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span>, Sanisera, and Magon<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span>.</p><p>In the open sea, at twelve miles' distance from the largerisland, is Capraria<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> with its treacherous coast, so notorious forits numerous shipwrecks; and, opposite to the city of Palma,are the islands known as the Mænariæ<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span>, Tiquadra<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span>, and LittleHannibalis<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span>.</p><p>The earth of Ebusus has the effect of driving away serpents,while that of Colubraria produces them; hence the latter spotis dangerous to all persons who have not brought with themsome of the earth of Ebusus. The Greeks have given itthe name of Ophiusa<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span>. Ebusus too produces no<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span> rabbits todestroy the harvests of the Baleares. There are also abouttwenty other small islands in this sea, which is full of shoals.Off the coast of Gaul, at the mouth of the Rhodanus, thereis Metina<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span>, and near it the island which is known as Blascon<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span>,with the three Stœchades, so called by their neighbours theMassilians<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span>, on account of the regular order in which theyare placed; their respective names are Prote<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span>, Mese<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span>, also<pb n="1213" />called Pomponiana, and Hypæa<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span>. After these come Sturium<span id="ref_31"><a href="#note_31">[31]</a></span>, Phœnice, Phila, Lero, and, opposite to Antipolis<span id="ref_32"><a href="#note_32">[32]</a></span>,Lerina<span id="ref_33"><a href="#note_33">[33]</a></span>, where there is a remembrance of a town calledVergoanum having once existed.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The modern Iviza and Formentera.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Greek for which is <foreign lang="greek">pi/tus.</foreign></p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Less than two leagues in width.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The real distance is 34 miles from the northern point of Iviza, calledPunta de Serra, to the southern point of Formentera, namely—across Iviza22 miles, across the sea 5, and across Formentera 7.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Denia.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is not correct: the distance is but 45 miles.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is incorrect: taken at the very greatest, the distance is only522 stadia, eight to the mile.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Xucar in Spain.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We more generally find it stated that the isle of Formentera, one ofthe Pityusse, was called Colubraria. He probably refers to the islandsof the group about twenty leagues from the coast of Spain, now knownby the name of Columbrete; but they are not near the Xucar, fromwhich, as well as from the Pityusss, they are distant about seventy miles.The latter islands are now generally considered as part of the group ofthe Baleares.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Majorca and Minorca, with the ancient Pityussæ.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">They served as mercenaries, first under the Carthaginians and afterwards under the Romans. The ancient writers generally derive the nameof the people from their skill as archers—<foreign lang="greek">balearei=s,</foreign> from <foreign lang="greek">ba/llw,</foreign> "tothrow "; but Strabo assigns to the name a Phœnician origin, as beingequivalent to the Greek <foreign lang="greek">gumnh=tai</foreign> "light-armed soldiers." It is probablyfrom their light equipment that the Greeks gave to the islands the nameof <foreign lang="greek">Gumnhsi(ai.</foreign> Livy says that they used to go naked during the summer.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Seventy miles is the real length of Majorca, and the circumferenceis barely 250 miles.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Still called Palma. This and Pollentia were Roman colonies settledby Metellus.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Pollenza.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Sineu on the Borga.</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The circumference is about 110 miles, the length 32.</p><p><span id="note_17"><a href="#ref_17">17. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Ciudadela.</p><p><span id="note_18"><a href="#ref_18">18. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Port Mahon. The site of Sanisera, which was probably moreinland, is unknown.</p><p><span id="note_19"><a href="#ref_19">19. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Cabrera. The distance is not twelve, but nine miles.</p><p><span id="note_20"><a href="#ref_20">20. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called the Malgrates.</p><p><span id="note_21"><a href="#ref_21">21. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Dragonera.</p><p><span id="note_22"><a href="#ref_22">22. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now El Torre.</p><p><span id="note_23"><a href="#ref_23">23. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">As already mentioned he seems to confound Formentera, which wascalled Ophiusa, with the present group of Columbrete, which islands wereprobably called Colubraria.</p><p><span id="note_24"><a href="#ref_24">24. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The former editions mostly omit "nec"; and so make it that Ebusus<hi rend="ital">does</hi> produce the rabbits. Certainly, it does seem more likely that he wouldmention that fact than the absence of it, which even to Pliny could notappear very remarkable.</p><p><span id="note_25"><a href="#ref_25">25. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">D'Anville thinks that this is Metapina, but D'Astruc thinks thatthe flat islands, called Les Tignes, are meant.</p><p><span id="note_26"><a href="#ref_26">26. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called Brescon, near Agde, according to D'Anville.</p><p><span id="note_27"><a href="#ref_27">27. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Who were of Greek origin, and so called them, because they stoodin a row, <foreign lang="greek">stoi=xos.</foreign></p><p><span id="note_28"><a href="#ref_28">28. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called Porqueroles. Prote signifies the first, Mese the middleone, and Hypæa the one below the others.</p><p><span id="note_29"><a href="#ref_29">29. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Port Croz. D'Anville considers that Pliny is mistaken inidentifying this island with Pomponiana or Pompeiana, which he considers to be the same with the peninsula now called Calle de Giens, whichlies opposite to Porqueroles.</p><p><span id="note_30"><a href="#ref_30">30. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called the Ile du Levant or du Titan. The group is called theIslands of Hières or Calypso.</p><p><span id="note_31"><a href="#ref_31">31. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">These are probably the little islands now known as Ratoneau, Pomègue, and If. It has however been suggested that these names belong tothe islands of Hières already mentioned in the text, and that Sturium isthe present Porquerolles, Phœnice Port-Croz, and Phila, Levant or Titan.</p><p><span id="note_32"><a href="#ref_32">32. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Antibes, or Antiboul in the Provençal idiom.</p><p><span id="note_33"><a href="#ref_33">33. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Saint Honorat de Lérins. The island of Lero is the presentSainte Marguerite de Lérins, and is nearer to Antibes than Lerina. TheLerinian monastery was much resorted to in the early ages of Christianity.</p></body>
