(1.)ÑTHE HONOUR ATTACHED TO PAINTING.</head><p>I HAVE now given at considerable length an account of thenature of metals, which constitute our wealth, and of thesubstances that are derived from them; so connecting myvarious subjects, as, at the same time, to describe an immensenumber of medicinal compositions which they furnish, themysteries<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> thrown upon them by the druggists, and the tediousminuti¾ of the arts of chasing,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and statuary,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and of dyeing.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>It remains for me to describe the various kinds of earths andstones; a still more extensive series of subjects, each of whichhas been treated of, by the Greeks more particularly, in a greatnumber of volumes. For my own part, I propose to employ adue degree of brevity, at the same time omitting nothing thatis necessary or that is a product of Nature.</p><p>I shall begin then with what still remains to be said withreference to painting, an art which was formerly illustrious,when it was held in esteem both by kings and peoples, andennobling those whom it deigned to transmit to posterity.But at the present day, it is completely banished in favourof marble, and even gold. For not only are whole walls nowcovered with marble, but the marble itself is carved out orelse marqueted so as to represent objects and animals ofvarious kinds. No longer now are we satisfied with formalcompartitions of marble, or with slabs extended like so manymountains in our chambers, but we must begin to paint thevery stone itself! This art was invented in the reign ofClaudius, but it was in the time of Nero that we discovered themethod of inserting in marble spots that do not belong to it,<pb n="6224" />and so varying its uniformity; and this, for the purpose ofrepresenting the marble of Numidia<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> variegated with ovals,and that of Synnada<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> veined with purple; just, in fact, asluxury might have willed that Nature should produce them.Such are our resources when the quarries fail us, and luxuryceases not to busy itself, in order that as much as possible maybe lost whenever a conflagration happens.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Officinarum tenebr¾;" probably in reference to the ignorance displayedby the compounders of medicines, as pointed out in B. xxxiii. c. 38,and in B. xxxiv. c. 25.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxxiii. c. 55.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxxiv. c. 9.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxxiii. c. 36.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxxvi. c. 8.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. v. c. 29.</p></body>
