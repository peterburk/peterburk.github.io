(50.)—OF THUNDER<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>; IN WHAT COUNTRIES ITDOES NOT FALL, AND FOR WHAT REASON.</head><p>Thunder is rare both in winter and in summer<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>, but from<pb n="1081" />different causes; the air, which is condensed in the winter,is made still more dense by a thicker covering of clouds,while the exhalations from the earth, being all of them rigidand frozen, extinguish whatever fiery vapour it may receive.It is this cause which exempts Scythia and the cold districtsround it from thunder. On the other hand, the excessiveheat exempts Egypt; the warm and dry vapours of the earthbeing very seldom condensed, and that only into light clouds.But, in the spring and autumn, thunder is more frequent,the causes which produce summer and winter being, in eachseason, less efficient. From this cause thunder is more frequent inItaly, the air being more easily set in motion, inconsequence of a milder winter and a showery summer, sothat it may be said to be always spring or autumn. Also inthose parts of Italy which recede from the north and lie towards thesouth, as in the district round our city, and inCampania, it lightens equally both in winter and in summer,which is not the case in other situations.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"fulmen."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This has been pointed out by Alexandre, Lemaire, i. 346, as one ofthe statements made by our author, which, in consequence of his followingthe Greek writers, applies rather to their climate than to that of Italy.The reader may form a judgement of the correctness of this remark bycomparing the account given by Aristotle and by Seneca; the former inMeteor. iii. 1. p. 573, 574, the latter in Nat.
