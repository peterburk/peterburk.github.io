<div2 type="chapter" n="58" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 58.—TWO REMEDIES DERIVED FROM CÆRULEUM.</head><p>Cæruleum has the medicinal property of acting as a detergentupon ulcers. Hence it is, that it is used as an ingredientin plasters, as also in cauteries. As to sil, it is pounded withthe greatest difficulty: viewed as a medicament, it is slightlymordent and astringent, and fills up the cavities left by ulcers.To make it the more serviceable, it is burnt in earthenvessels.</p><p>The prices of things, which I have in different placesannexed, vary, I am well aware, according to the locality, andexperience a change almost every year: variations dependentupon the opportunities afforded for navigation, and the termsupon which the merchant may have purchased the article. Itmay so happen, too, that some wealthy dealer has engrossedthe market, and so enhanced the price: for I am by no meansforgetful of the case of Demetrius, who in the reign of theEmperor Nero was accused before the consuls by the wholecommunity of the Seplasia.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> Still, however, I have thought<pb n="6144" />it necessary to annex the usual price of each commodity atRome, in order to give some idea of their relative values.</p><p>SUMMARY.—Remedies, narratives, and observations, onethousand one hundred and twenty-five.</p><p>ROMAN AUTHORS QUOTED.—Domitianus Cæsar,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> Junius Gracchanus,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>L.

We learn from the writings of Suetonius,that the Emperor Domitian devoted himself to literary pursuits in hisyounger days, and Quintilian and the younger Pliny speak of his poeticalproductions as equal to those of the greatest masters. Sillig expresses anopinion that Pliny may possibly have borrowed something from his works,and inserted his name, with a view of pleasing the young prince and hisfather, the Emperor Vespasian.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He is quoted in Chapter 9 of this Book, where it appears that he tookhis cognomen on account of his friendship for C.

Licinius Macer, a person ofprætorian rank, who, on being impeached of extortion by Cicero, committedsuicide. We learn from our author, B. xxxiv. c. 50, that in hisyouth he devoted himself to study with the greatest zeal, and applied himselfwith singular energy to intellectual pursuits. His constitution, however,was early exhausted, and he died in his 35th or 36th year, leavingbehind him twenty-one orations. We learn from Cicero and Quintilianthat his compositions were carefully moulded after the models of the Atticschool, but were deficient in ease and freshness. As a poet he was theauthor of many short pieces, equally remarkable for their looseness andelegance. He wrote also some severe lampoons on Pompey and Cæsar,and their respective partisans. Ovid and Horace, besides several of theprose writers, make mention of him.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See end of B. ii.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See end of B. ii.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cornelius Bocchus.
