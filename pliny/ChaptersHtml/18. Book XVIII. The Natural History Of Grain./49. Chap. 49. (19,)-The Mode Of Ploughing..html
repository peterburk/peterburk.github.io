<div2 type="chapter" n="49" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 49. (19,)—THE MODE OF PLOUGHING.</head><p>In ploughing, the most rigid attention should be paid to the<pb n="4063" />oracular precepts given by Cato<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> on the subject. "What isthe essence of good tillage? Good ploughing. What is thesecond point? Ploughing again. What is the third point?Manuring. Take care not to make crooked furrows. Becareful to plough at the proper time." In warm localities itis necessary to open the ground immediately after the wintersolstice, but where it is coke, directly after the vernal equinox:this, too, should be done sooner in dry districts than in wet ones,in a dense soil than a loose one, in a rich land than a meagreone. In countries where the summers are hot and oppressive,the soil cretaceous or thin, it is the best plan to plough betweenthe summer solstice and the autumnal equinox. Where, onthe other hand, the heat is moderate, with frequent falls of rain,and the soil rich and full of vegetation, the ploughing shouldbe done during the prevalence of the heat. A deep, heavysoil, again, should be ploughed in winter; but one that is verythin and dry, only just before putting in the seed.</p><p>Tillage, too, has its own particular rules<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>—Never touch theground while it is wet and cloggy; plough with all your might;loosen the ground before you begin to plough. This methodhas its advantages, for by turning up the clods the roots of theweeds are killed. Some persons recommend that in every casethe ground should be turned up immediately after the vernalequinox. Land that has been ploughed once in spring, fromthat circumstance has the name of "vervactum."<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> This, too,is equally necessary in the case of fallow land, by which termis meant land that is sown only in alternate years. The oxenemployed in ploughing should be harnessed as tightly as possible, tomake them plough with their heads up; attentionpaid to this point will prevent them from galling the neck. Ifit is among trees and vines that you are ploughing, the oxenshould be muzzled, to prevent them from eating off the tenderbuds. There should be a small bill-hook, too, projecting fromthe plough-tail, for the purpose of cutting up the roots; thisplan being preferable to that of turning them up with the share,and so straining the oxen. When ploughing, finish the furrowat one spell, and never stop to take breath in the middle.<pb n="4064" /></p><p>It is a fair day's work to plough one jugerum, for the firsttime, nine inches in depth; and the second time, one jugerumand a half—that is to say, if it is an easy soil. If this, however,is not the case, it will take a day to turn up half ajugerum for the first time, and a whole jugerum the second; forNature has set limits to the powers of animals even. Thefurrows should be made, in every case, first in a straight line,and then others should be drawn, crossing them obliquely.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>Upon a hill-side the furrows are drawn transversely<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> only,the point of the share inclining upwards at one moment anddownwards<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> at another. Man, too, is so well fitted for labour,that he is able to supply the place of the ox even; at all events,it is without the aid of that animal that the mountain tribesplough, having only the hoe to help them.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span></p><p>The ploughman, unless he stoops to his work, is sure toprevaricate,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> a word which has been transferred to the Forum,asa censure upon those who transgress—at any rate, let those beon their guard against it, where it was first employed. Theshare should be cleaned every now and then with a stick pointedwith a scraper. The ridges that are left between every twofurrows, should not be left in a rough state, nor should largeclods be left protruding from the ground. A field is badlyploughed that stands in need of harrowing after the seed is in;but the work has been properly done, when it is impossible tosay in which direction the share has gone. It is a good plan,too, to leave a channel every now and then, if the nature of thespot requires it, by making furrows of a larger size, to draw offthe water into the drains.</p><p>(20.) After the furrows have been gone over again transversely,the clods are broken, where there is a necessity for it, witheither the harrow or the rake;<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> and this operation is repeated<pb n="4065" />after the seed has been put in. This last harrowing is done,where the usage of the locality will allow of it, with either atoothed harrow, or else a plank attached to the plough. This operationof covering in the seed is called "lirare," from which isderived the word "deliratio."<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> Virgil,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> it isgenerally thought,intends to recommend sowing after <hi rend="ital">four</hi> ploughings, in thepassage where he says that land will bear the best crop, whichhas twice felt the sun and twice the cold. Where the soil isdense, as in most parts of Italy, it is a still better plan to goover the ground five times before sowing; in Etruria, they givethe land as many as nine ploughings first. The bean, however,and the vetch may be sown with no risk, without turning upthe land at all; which, of course, is so much labour saved.</p><p>We must not here omit to mention still one other method ofploughing, which the devastations of warfare have suggestedin Italy that lies beyond the Padus. The Salassi,<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> whenravaging the territories which lay at the foot of the Alps, madean attempt to lay waste the crops of panic and millet that werejust appearing above the ground. Finding, however, thatNature resisted all their endeavours, they passed the ploughover the ground, the result of which was that the crops weremore abundant than ever; and this it was that first taught usthe method of ploughing in, expressed by the word "artrare,"otherwise "aratrare," in my opinion the original form. Thisis done either just as the stem begins to develope itself, or elsewhen it has put forth as many as two or three leaves. Normust we withhold from the reader a more recent method, whichwas discovered the year but one before this,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> in the territoryof the Treviri. The crops having been nipped by the extremeseverity of the winter, the people sowed the land over againin the month of March, and had a most abundant harvest.</p><p>We shall now proceed to a description of the peculiar methodsemployed in cultivating each description of grain.<pb n="4066" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">De Re Rust. c. 61.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">These rules are borrowed mostly from Varro, B. i. c. 19, andCojumella, B. ii. c. 4.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Vere actum;" "worked in spring."</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Virgil says the same, Georg. i. 9.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Crosswise, or horizontally.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Zig-zag, apparently.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A rude foreshadowing of the spade husbandry so highly spoken ofat the present day.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Prevaricare," "to make a balk," as we call it, to make a tortuousfurrow diverging from the straight line.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He probably means the heavy "rastrum," or rake, mentioned byVirgil, Georg, i. 164.
