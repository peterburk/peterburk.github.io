THE CERINTHA.</head><p>Bees and beehives, too, are a subject extremely well suitedto a description of gardens and garland plants, while, at thesame time, where they are successfully managed, they are asource, without any great outlay, of very considerable profit.For bees, then, the following plants should be grown—thyme,apiastrum, the rose, the various violets, the lily, the cytisus,the bean, the fitch, cunila, the poppy, conyza,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> cassia, the me-<pb n="4340" />lilote, melissophyllum,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and the cerintha.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> This last is a plantwith a white leaf, bent inwards, the stem of it being a cubitin height, with a flower at the top presenting a concavity fullof a juice like honey. Bees are remarkably fond of the flowersof these plants, as also the blossoms of mustard, a thing thatis somewhat surprising, seeing that it is a well-known fact thatthey will not so much as touch the blossoms of the olive: forwhich reason, it will be as well to keep that tree at a distancefrom them.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span></p><p>There are other trees, again, which should be planted asnear the hives as possible, as they attract the swarm when itfirst wings its flight, and so prevent the bees from wanderingto any considerable distance.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xix. c. 50.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Honey-leaf."

On the contrary, Virgil says, Georg. iv. 1. 20, thata wild olive-tree should be planted near the hives, to protect them with itsshade. Varro says also, De Re Rust. iii. 16, that the bee extracts honeyfrom the olive-tree; but according to Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. ix. c. 64,it is from the leaf, and not the flower of that tree that the honey is extracted.</p></body>
