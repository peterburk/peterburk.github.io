Seius, a contemporary of his, and a Roman ofequestrian rank. However, a thing about which there is nodispute, it was Messalinus Cotta, the son of the orator Messala,who first discovered the art of roasting the webbed feet of thegoose, and of cooking them in a ragout with cocks' combs: forI shall faithfully award each culinary palm to such as I shallfind deserving of it. It is a wonderful fact, in relation tothis bird, that it comes on foot all the way from the countryof the Morini<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> to Rome; those that are tired are placed inthe front rank, while the rest, taught by a natural instinct tomove in a compact body, drive them on.</p><p>A second income, too, is also to be derived from the feathersof the white goose. In some places, this animal is pluckedtwice a year, upon which the feathers quickly grow again.Those are the softest which lie nearest to the body, and thosethat come from Germany are the most esteemed: the geesethere are white, but of small size, and are called <hi rend="ital">gantœ.</hi><span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> Theprice paid for their feathers is five denarii per pound. It isfrom this fruitful source that we have repeated charges broughtagainst the commanders of our auxiliaries, who are in the habitof detaching whole cohorts from the posts where they oughtto be on guard, in pursuit of these birds: indeed, we havecome to such a pitch of effeminacy, that now-a-days, not even<pb n="2500" />the men can think of lying down without the aid of the goose'sfeathers, by way of pillow.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. viii. c. 87.
