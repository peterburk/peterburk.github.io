One fish, the growth of which is quite perceptible, day byday, is known as the amia.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> This fish, and the pelamides,together with the tunnies,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> enter the Euxine in shoals, forthe purpose of obtaining a sweeter nutriment, each under thecommand of its own leader; but first of all the scomber<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> ap-<pb n="2387" />pears, which is of a sulphureous tint when in the water, butwhen out of it resembles other fish in colour. The salt-waterpreserves<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> of Spain are filled with these last fish, but the tunnies do not consort with them.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle, Hist.

Appiansays, that it israther smaller than the tunny. Rondelet, B. viii., speaks ofit as being, in his time, known by the name of "byza." Cuvier has the following remark. "The 'amia' of the ancients, as Rondelet was well aware,was the same fish, to which, incorrectly, upon nearly all the coasts of theMediterranean, the name of 'pelamis' has been transferred. It is, infact, the same as the 'limosa' of Salvianus, the 'pelamis' of Belon,the ' thynnus primus' of Aldrovandus, and the 'scomber sarda' of Bloch.The proof of all these being synonymous, is the fact, that the ' scomber sarda'is the only species of the tunny genus in the Mediterranean, which hasstrong, sharp, cutting teeth, and is capable of attacking large fish, whichAristotle relates respecting the amia, Hist. Anim. B. ix. c. 37. The sameauthor too, was well aware of the length of its gall-bladder, which is greaterthan in most other fishes."</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle, Hist.

It was wrapped in paper when exposed for sale, and bad poetswere threatened with the mackerel, as they are at the present day with thegrocer or butterman; or, as in the time of the Spectator, with the trunk-maker. Thus Persius says, Sat. i, 1. 43. "and to leave writings worthyto be preserved in cedar, and verses that dread neither mackerel norfrankincense." Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. ix. c. 2, enumerates this fishamong those that are gregarious, and places it in company with the tunnyand the pelamis, but states that it is inferior in strength, B. viii. c. 2.Cuvier says, that the mackerel still has names in different parts that arederived from the word "scomber," they being called "sgombri" at Con-stantinople, scombri at Venice, and scurmu, scrumiu, and scumbirro inSicily.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cetarias. These "cetariæ," or "cetaria," Papias says, were pieces ofstanding salt water, in the vicinity of the sea-shore, in which tunnies andother large fish were kept, and adjoining to which were the salting-houses.In the middle ages these preserves were called "tunnariæ," or "tunneries."</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">As in the Euxine. Tunnies were caught on the Spanish coasts, as welearn from Athenveus, who, as quoted above, mentions the fisheries offGades, for the orcynus, or large tunny. See N. 37, p. 385.</p></body>
