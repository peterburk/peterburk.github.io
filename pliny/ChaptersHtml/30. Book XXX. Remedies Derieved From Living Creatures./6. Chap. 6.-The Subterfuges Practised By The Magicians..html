Was this perchance theobstacle<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> in Nero's way? As for his limbs, there was<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> nothingdeficient in them. And then, besides, he was at liberty tomake choice of the days prescribed by the magic ritual: itwas an easy thing for him to make choice of sheep whosecolour was no other than perfectly black: and as to sacrificinghuman beings, there was nothing in the world that gave himgreater pleasure. The Magian Tiridates<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> was at his court,having repaired thither, in token of our triumph over Armenia,accompanied by a train which cost dear to the provinces throughwhich it passed. For the fact was, that he was unwilling totravel by water, it being a maxim with the adepts in this artthat it is improper to spit into the sea or to profane that elementby any other of the evacuations that are inseparable from theinfirmities of human nature. He brought with him, too,several other Magi, and went so far as to initiate the emperorin the repasts<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> of the craft; and yet the prince, for all he hadbestowed a kingdom upon the stranger, found himself unableto receive at his hands, in return, this art.</p><p>We may rest fully persuaded then, that magic is a thingdetestable in itself. Frivolous and lying as it is, it still bears,however, some shadow of truth upon it; though reflected, inreality, by the practices of those who study the arts of secretpoisoning, and not the pursuits of magic. Let any one pictureto himself the lies of the magicians of former days, when helearns what has been stated by the grammarian Apion,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> a<pb n="5429" />person whom I remember seeing myself when young. Hetells us that the plant cynocephalia,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> known in Egypt as"osiritis," is useful for divination, and is a preservative againstall the malpractices of magic, but that if a person takes it outof the ground entire, he will die upon the spot. He asserts,also, that he himself had raised the spirits<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> of the dead, inorder to make enquiry of Homer in reference to his nativecountry and his parents; but he does not dare, he tells us,disclose the answer he received.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Suetonius says that his body was full of foul spots.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It was probably a doctrine of Magic, that an adept must not be de-ficient in any of his limbs.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">After being conquered by the Roman general, Corbulo, he receivedthe crown of Armenia from Nero, A.D. <date value="63" authname="63">63</date>.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">All vegetable substances were divided, according to their doctrine, intothe pure and the impure, the rule being strictly observed at their repasts.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See end of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxv. c. 80.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Like the assertions of the famous impostor of the close of the lastcentury, Count Cagliostro.</p></body>
