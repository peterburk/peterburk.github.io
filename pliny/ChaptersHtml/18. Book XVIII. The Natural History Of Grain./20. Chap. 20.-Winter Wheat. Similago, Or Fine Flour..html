<div2 type="chapter" n="20" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 20.—WINTER WHEAT. SIMILAGO, OR FINE FLOUR.</head><p>There is no grain that displays a greater avidity than wheat,and none that absorbs a greater quantity of nutriment. Withall propriety I may justly call winter wheat<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> the very choicestof all the varieties of wheat. It is white, destitute of allflavour,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and not oppressive<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> to the stomach. It suits moist<pb n="4033" />localities particularly well, such as we find in Italy and GalliaComata; but beyond the Alps it is found to maintain its character only in the territory of the Allobroges and that of theMemini; for in the other parts of those countries it degenerates at the end of two years into common wheat.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> The onlymethod of preventing this is to take care and sow the heaviestgrains only.</p><p>(9.) Winter wheat furnishes bread of the very finest qualityand the most esteemed delicacies of the bakers. The bestbread that is known in Italy is made from a mixture of Cam-panian winter wheat with that of Pisæ. The Campanian kindis of a redder colour, while the latter is white; when mixedwith chalk,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> it is increased in weight. The proper proportionfor the yield of Campanian wheat to the modius of grain isfour sextarii of what is known as bolted flour;<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> but when itis used in the rough and has not been bolted, then the yieldshould be five sextarii of flour. In addition to this, in eithercase there should be half a modius of white meal, with foursextarii of coarse meal, known as "seconds," and the samequantity of bran.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> The Pisan wheat produces five sextarii offine flour to the modius; in other respects it yields the sameas that of Campania. The wheat of Clusium and Arretiumgives another sextarius of fine flour, but the yield is similar tothat of the kinds already mentioned in all other respects.If, however, as much of it as possible is converted into finewheat meal, the modius will yield sixteen pounds weight ofwhite bread, and three of seconds, with half a modius of bran.These differences, however, depend very materially upon thegrinding; for when the grain is ground quite dry it producesmore meal, but when sprinkled with salt water<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> a whiterflour, though at the same time a greater quantity of bran. Itis very evident that "firina," the name we give to meal, isderived from "far." A modius of meal made from Gallic winter<pb n="4034" />wheat, yields twenty-two pounds of bread; while that of Italy,if made into bread baked in tins,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> will yield two or threepounds more. When the bread is baked in the oven,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> twopounds must be added in weight in either case.</p><p>(10.) Wheat yields a fine flour<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> of the very highest quality.In African wheat the modius ought to yield half a modius offine flour and five sextarii of pollen, that being the namegiven to fine wheat meal, in the same way that that of winterwheat is generally known as "fos," or the "flower." Thisfine meal is extensively used in copper works and paper manufactories. In addition to the above, the modius should yieldfour sextarii of coarse meal, and the same quantity of bran.The finest wheaten flour will yield one hundred<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> and twenty-two pounds of bread, and the fine meal of winter wheat onehundred<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> and seventeen, to the modius of grain. When theprices of grain are moderate, meal sells at forty asses the modius, bolted wheaten flour at eight asses more, and boltedflour of winter wheat, at sixteen asses more. There is anotherdistinction again in fine wheaten flour, which originated formerly in the days of L. Paul's. There were three classes ofwheat; the first of which would appear to have yielded seventeen pounds of bread, the second eighteen, and the third nineteen pounds and a third: to these were added two pounds anda half of seconds,<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> and the same quantity of brown<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> bread,with six sextarii of bran.<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span></p><p>Winter wheat never ripens all at once, and yet there is noneof the cereals that can so ill brook any delay; it being of sodelicate a nature, that the ears directly they are ripe will beginto shed their grain. So long, however, as it is in stalk, it isexposed to fewer risks than other kinds of wheat, from the fact<pb n="4035" />of its always having the ear upright, and not retaining thedew, which is a prolific cause of mildew.</p><p>From arinca<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> a bread of remarkable sweetness is made.The grains in this variety lie closer than they do in spelt; theear, too, is larger and more weighty. It is rarely the casethat a modius of this grain does not weigh full sixteen pounds.In Greece they find great difficulty in threshing it; and henceit is that we find Homer<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> saying that it is given to beasts ofburden, this being the same as the grain that he calls "olyra."In Egypt it is threshed without any difficulty, and is remarkably prolific. Spelt has no beard, and the same is the casewith winter wheat, except<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> that known as the Laconionvariety. To the kinds already mentioned we have to addbromos,<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> the winter wheat just excepted, and tragos,<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> all ofthem exotics introduced from the East, and very similar torice. Tiphe<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> also belongs to the same class, from which inour part of the world a cleaned grain resembling rice is prepared. Among the Greeks, too, there is the grain knownas zea; and it is said that this, as well as tiphe, when cleanedfrom the husk and sown, will degenerate<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span> and assume theform of wheat; not immediately, but in the course of threeyears.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Siligo." There are numerous contradictions in Pliny with referenceto this plant, but it is now pretty generally agreed that it is the Triticumhibernum of Linnæus: the "froment tousselle" of the French. It wasformerly the more general opinion that it was identical with spelt; butthat cannot be the case, as spelt is red, and siligo is described as white.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Sine virtute" It is doubtful what is the meaning of this.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Sine pondere.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In other places he says, most unaccountably, that wheat "degeneratesinto siligo."</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">As to this practice, see c. 29.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Quam vocant castratam."</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From this account, it would appear that there were twenty-four sextarii to the modius; but the account in general is very contradictory.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Salt water is rarely used for this purpose in modern times.
