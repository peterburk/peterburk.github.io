Thewhite grapes, on the other hand, are sweeter, for, being transparent, the air penetrates them with greater facility.</p><p>Grapes fresh gathered are productive of flatulency, and disturb the stomach and bowels; hence it is that they are avoidedin fevers, in large quantities more particularly. Indeed, theyare very apt to produce oppression of the head, and to bring onthe malady known as lethargy.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> Grapes which have beengathered, and left to hang for some time, are much less<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> injurious, the exposure to the air rendering them beneficial even tothe stomach, and refreshing to the patient, as they are slightlycooling, and tend to remove nausea and qualmishness.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This remark is founded, in a great measure, upon fact. The skin ofthe black grape contains a colouring principle in considerable abundance.and a small proportion of tannin; that of the white grape possesses nocolouring principle, but a considerable quantity of tannin. The whitegrape contains more saccharine matter than the black one, and they areboth of them of a laxative nature.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Littré remarks, that under the name of "lethlargus," a febrile maladyis probably meant, which belongs probably to the class of pseudo-con-tinuous fevers.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Fée thinks that in reality there can be little or no difference in theireffects, but that, being eaten in larger quantities at the vintage than afterwards, it stands to reason that the result will be different.</p></body>
