As to the name, it has been so much bandiedabout among other precious stones of conspicuous beauty, thatit has quite assumed the privilege of being a synonymousterm<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> for all that is charming to the eye. Still, however, thereis one<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> stone in particular which fully merits all the commendationthat might be expected for a stone with so prepossessinga name: for in itself it reunites the transparency of crystal,the peculiar green of the sky, the deep tints of purple,and a sort of bright reflex, like that of a golden-colouredwine; a reflex, indeed, that is always the last to meetthe eye, but is always crowned with the lustrous hues ofpurple. The stone, in fact, has all the appearance of havingbeen bathed in each of these tints, individually, and yet in thewhole of them at once. There is no precious stone either thathas a clearer water than this, or that presents a more pleasingsweetness to the eye.</p><p>Pæderos of the finest quality comes from India, where it isknown as "sangenon;" the next best being that of Egypt,called "tenites." That of third-rate quality is found in Arabia,but it is rough upon the surface. Next, we have the stone ofPontus, the radiance of which is softer than in that of Thasos,which, in its turn, is of a more mellowed colour than thestones of Galatia, Thrace, and Cyprus. The defects com-<pb n="6437" />monly found in these stones are, a want of brilliancy, a confusionwith colours which do not properly belong to them, and theother imperfections which are found in stones in general.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Lovely youth."
