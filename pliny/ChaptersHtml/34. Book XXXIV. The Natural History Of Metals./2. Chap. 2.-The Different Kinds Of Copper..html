<div2 type="chapter" n="2" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 2.ÑTHE DIFFERENT KINDS OF COPPER.</head><p>The ore is extracted in the mode that has been describedabove,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and is then purified by fusion. The metal is alsoobtained from a coppery stone called "cadmia."<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> The mosthighly esteemed copper is procured from beyond seas: it wasformerly obtained in Campania also, and at present is found inthe country of the Bergomates,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> at the extremity of Italy.It is said to have been lately discovered also in the province ofGermany.</p><p>(2.) In Cyprus, where copper was first discovered, it is also procuredfrom another stone, which is called "chalcitis."<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> This,however, was afterwards considered of little value, a betterkind having been found in other regions, especially that called"aurichalcum,"<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> which was long in high request, on account of<pb n="6149" />its excellent quality; but none of it has been found for thislong time, the earth having been quite exhausted. The kindwhich was next in value was the Sallustian,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> procured fromthe Alpine district of the Centrones;<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> but this did not lastlong, and was succeeded by the Livian, in Gaul. They bothtook their names from the owners of the mines; the former afriend of the Emperor Augustus, the latter that emperor'swife.<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> They soon failed, however, and in the Livian eventhere is now found but a very small quantity of ore. Thatwhich is at present held in the highest estimation is theMarian, likewise known as the Corduban:<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> next to the Livian,this kind most readily absorbs cadmia, and becomes almost asexcellent as aurichalcum<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> for making sesterces and doubleasses,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> the Cyprian copper being thought good enough for theas. Thus much concerning the natural qualities of this metal.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. xxxiii. c. 31, where we have an account of the ores of silver.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny again refers to this mineral in the 22d Chapter. We have nomeans of ascertaining, with certainty, what is the substance to which thisname was applied by the ancients. The ores of copper are very numerous,and of various chemical constitutions: the most abundant, and thosemost commonly employed in the production of the pure metal, are thesulphurets, more especially what is termed copper pyrites, and the oxides.It has been supposed, by some commentators, that the Cadmia of the ancientswas Calamine, which is an ore of zinc; but we may be confidentthat the <hi rend="ital">®s</hi> of the ancients could not be produced from this substance,because, as has been stated above, the <hi rend="ital">®s</hi> contains no zinc. I must, however,observe that the contrary opinion is maintained by M. Delafosse.ÑB.See Note 2 above.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The inhabitants of Bergamum, the modern Bergamo.ÑB. See B. iii.c. 21.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle gives the same account of the copper ore of Cyprus. Chalcitisis also spoken of by Dioscorides, as an ore of copper.ÑB. See furtheras to "Chaicitis," in Chapter 29 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There has been much discussion respecting the nature of this substance,and the derivation of the word. Hardouin conceives it probablethat it was originally written "orichaleum," <hi rend="ital">i.e.</hi> "mountain brass" or"copper."ÑB. Ajasson considers it to be native brass, a mixture of copperand zinc. In the later writers it signifies artificial brass. The exact compositionof this metal is still unknown, but there is little doubt that Hardouinis right in his supposition as to the origin of the name.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Possibly so called from Sallustius Crispus, the historian, who was oneof the secretaries of Augustus.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There is some doubt respecting the locality of these people; they areenumerated by Pliny among the inhabitants of the mountainous districts ofSavoy, B. iii. c. 24, and are referred to by Ptolemy.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Livia.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It was named "Marian," after the celebrated Marius, and "Corduban,"from the place whence it was procured; probably the mountains nearCorduba, in Spain, well known as the birth-place of the two Senecas andof Lucan.ÑB. See B. iii. c. 3, and B. xix. c. 43.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">No light is thrown upon the nature either of Cadmia or Aurichalcumby this statement; we only learn from it that different compounds, or substancespossessing different physical properties, went under the commonappellation of <hi rend="ital">®s,</hi> and were, each of them, employed in the formation ofcoins.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Dupondiariis." The "as," it must be remembered, <hi rend="ital">originally</hi>weighed one pound. See B. xxxiii. c. 13, and the Introduction to Vol. III.19 He alludes to the <hi rend="ital">ancient</hi> works of art in this compound metal.</p></body>
