This certainly is the cause why thestars of the northern portion of the heavens never set to us,and why, on the other hand, those in the south never rise,and again, why the latter can never be seen by the former,the globe of the earth rising up and concealing them. The<pb n="1103" />Northern Wain is never seen in Troglodytice<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>, nor in Egypt,which borders on it<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>; nor can we, in Italy, see the star Canopus<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>,or Berenice's Hair<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>; nor what, under the EmperorAugustus, was named C¾sar's Throne, although they are,there<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>, very brilliant stars. The curved form of the earth isso obvious, rising up like a ridge, that Canopus appears to aspectator at Alexandria to rise above the horizon almost thequarter of a sign; the same star at Rhodes appears, as itwere, to graze along the earth, while in Pontus it is not seenat all; where the Northern Wain appears considerablyelevated. This same constellation cannot be seen at Rhodes,and still less at Alexandria. In Arabia, in the month ofNovember, it is concealed during the first watch of thenight, but may be seen during the second<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>; in Mero‘ it isseen, for a short time, in the evening, at the solstice, and itis visible at day-break, for a few days before the rising ofArcturus<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>. These facts have been principally ascertainedby the expeditions of navigators; the sea appearing moreelevated or depressed in certain parts<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>; the stars suddenlycoming into view, and, as it were, emerging from the water,after having been concealed by the bulging out of the globe<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>.But the heavens do not, as some suppose, rise higher at one<pb n="1104" />pole, otherwise<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> its stars would be seen from all parts of theworld; they indeed are supposed to be higher by those whoare nearest to them, but the stars are sunk below the horizonto those who are more remote. As this pole appears to beelevated to those who are beneath it; so, when we havepassed along the convexity of the earth, those stars rise up,which appear elevated to the inhabitants of those other districts;all this, however, could not happen unless the earthhad the shape of a globe.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Troglodytice of the ancients may be considered as nearly corresponding to the modern Abyssinia and Nubia.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This remark is incorrect, as far as respects nearly the whole of Egypt;see the remarks of Marcus, in Ajasson, ii. 245.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is a star of the first magnitude in the southern constellation ofArgo; we have a similar statement in Manilius, i. 216, 217.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The commentators suppose that the star or constellation here referredto cannot be the same with what bears this name on the modern celestialatlas; vide Hardouin <hi rend="ital">in loco,</hi> also Marc. in Ajasson, <hi rend="ital">utsupra.</hi> Theconstellation of Berenice's hair forms the subject of Catullus's 67thpoem.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In Troglodytice and in Egypt.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The first watch of the night was from 6 P.M. to 9;the second from9 to midnight.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">According to Columella, xi. 2. 369, this was 9 Calend.
