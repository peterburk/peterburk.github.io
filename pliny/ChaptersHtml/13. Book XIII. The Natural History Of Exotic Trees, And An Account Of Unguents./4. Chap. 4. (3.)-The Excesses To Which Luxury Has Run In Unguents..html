<div2 type="chapter" n="4" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 4. (3.)ÑTHE EXCESSES TO WHICH LUXURY HAS RUN INUNGUENTS.</head><p>These perfumes form the objects of a luxury which may belooked upon as being the most superfluous of any, for pearlsand jewels, after all, do pass to a man's representative,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> andgarments have some durability; but unguents lose theirodour in an instant, and die away the very hour they areused. The very highest recommendation of them is, thatwhen a female passes by, the odour which proceeds from hermay possibly attract the attention of those even who till thenare intent upon something else. In price they exceed so largea sum even as four hundred denarii per pound: so vast is theamount that is paid for a luxury made not for our own enjoyment, but for that of others; for the person who carries theperfume about him is not the one, after all, that smells it.</p><p>And yet, even here, there are some points of difference thatdeserve to be remarked. We read in the works of Cicero,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>that those unguents which smell of the earth are preferable tothose which smell of saffron; being a proof, that even in amatter which most strikingly bespeaks our state of extremecorruptness, it is thought as well to temper the vice by a littleshow of austerity.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> There are some persons too who look moreparticularly for consistency<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> in their unguents, to which theyaccordingly give the name of "spissum;<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> thus showing thatthey love not only to be sprinkled, but even to be plastered over,with unguents. We have known the very soles<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> even of thefeet to be sprinkled with perfumes; a refinement which wastaught, it is said, by M. Otho<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> to the Emperor Nero. How,<pb n="3168" />I should like to know, could a perfume be at all perceptible,or, indeed, productive of any kind of pleasure, when placedon that part of the body? We have heard also of a privateperson giving orders for the walls of the bath-room to besprinkled with unguents, while the Emperor Caius<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> had thesame thing done to his sitting-bath:<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> that this, too, might notbe looked upon as the peculiar privilege of a prince, it wasafterwards done by one of the slaves that belonged to Nero.</p><p>But the most wonderful thing of all is, that this kind ofluxurious gratification should have made its way into the campeven: at all events, the eagles and the standards, dusty asthey are, and bristling with their sharpened points, areanointed on festive<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> days. I only wish it could, by any possibility, be stated who it was that first taught us this practice.It was, no doubt, under the corrupting influence of such temptations as these, that our eagles achieved the conquest<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> of theworld: thus do we seek to obtain their patronage and sanction for our vices, and make them our precedent for usingunguents even beneath the casque.<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Heres."

He suggests, however, that this odour attributed by the ancients to the earth, mayin reality have proceeded from the fibrous roots of thyme and other plants.If such is not the real solution, it seems impossible to suggest any other.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">By giving preference to the more simple odours.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Crassitudo."</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "thick" unguent.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We learn from Athen¾us, and a passage in the Aulularia of Plautus,that this was done long before Nero's time, among the Greeks.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Who succeeded Galba.
