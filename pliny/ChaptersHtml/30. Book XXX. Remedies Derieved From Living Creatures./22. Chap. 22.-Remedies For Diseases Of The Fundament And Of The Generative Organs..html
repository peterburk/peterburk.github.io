<div2 type="chapter" n="22" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 22.—REMEDIES FOR DISEASES OF THE FUNDAMENT AND OFTHE GENERATIVE ORGANS.</head><p>The most efficacious remedies for diseases of the rectum arewool-grease—to which some add pompholix<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and oil of roses—a dog's head, reduced to ashes; or a serpent's slough, withvinegar. In cases where there are chaps and fissures of thoseparts, the ashes of the white portion of dogs' dung are used,mixed with oil of roses; a prescription due, they say, to Æsculapius,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and remarkably efficacious also for the removal ofwarts. Ashes of burnt mouse-dung, swan's fat, and cowsuet, are also used. Procidence of the rectum is reduced by anapplication of the juices discharged by snails when punctured.For the cure of excoriation of those parts, ashes of burnt woodmice are used, with honey; the gall of a hedge-hog, with abat's brains and bitches' milk; goose-grease, with the brains ofthe bird, alum, and wool-grease; or else pigeons' dung, mixedwith honey. A spider, the head and legs being first removed,is remarkably good as a friction for condylomata. To preventthe acridity of the humours from fretting the flesh, goosegrease is applied, with Punic wax, white lead, and oil ofroses; swan's grease also, which is said to be a cure for piles.</p><p>A very good thing, they say, for sciatica, is, to pound rawsnails in Aminean<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> wine, and to take them with pepper; toeat a green lizard, the feet, head, and intestines being firstremoved; or to eat a spotted lizard, with the addition of threeoboli of black poppy. Ruptures and convulsions are treatedwith sheep's gall, diluted with woman's milk. The gravy whichescapes from a ram's lights roasted, is used for the cure ofitching pimples and warts upon the generative organs: forother affections of those parts, the ashes of a ram's wool, unwashed even, are used, applied with water; the suet of asheep's caul, and of the kidneys more particularly, mixed withashes of pumice-stone and salt; greasy wool, applied with coldwater; sheep's flesh, burnt to ashes, and applied with water;<pb n="5446" />a mule's hoofs, burnt to ashes; or the powder of poundedhorse teeth, sprinkled upon the parts. In cases of decidenceof either of the testes, an application of the slime dischargedby snails is remedial, they say. For the treatment of sordidor running ulcers of those parts, the fresh ashes of a burntdog's head are found highly useful; the small, broad kind ofsnail, beaten up in vinegar; a snake's slough, or the ashes ofit, applied in vinegar; honey in which the bees have died,mixed with resin; or the kind of snail without a shell, that isfound in Africa, as already<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> mentioned, beaten up with powdered frankincense and white of eggs, the application beingrenewed at the end of thirty days; some persons, however,substitute a bulb for the frankincense.</p><p>For the cure of hydrocele, a spotted lizard, they say, ismarvellously good, the head, feet, and intestines being firstremoved, and the rest of the body roasted and taken frequentlywith the food. For incontinence<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> of urine dogs' fat is used,mixed with a piece of split alum the size of a bean; ashes,also, of African snails burnt with the shells, taken in drink;or else the tongues of three geese roasted and eaten with thefood, a remedy which we owe to Anaxilaiis. Mutton-suet,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>mixed with parched salt, has an aperient effect upon inflammatory tumours, and mouse-dung, mixed with powderedfrankincense and sandarach, acts upon them as a dispellent:the ashes, also, of a burnt lizard, or the lizard itself, splitasunder and applied; or else bruised millepedes, mixed with onethird part of turpentine. Some make use of earth of Sinope<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>for this purpose, mixed with a bruised snail. Ashes ofempty snail-shells burnt alone, mixed with wax, possess certain repercussive properties; the same, too, with pigeons' dung,employed by itself, or applied with oat-meal or barley-meal.Cantharides, mixed with lime, remove inflammatory tumoursquite as effectually as the lancet; and small snails, appliedtopically with honey, have a soothing effect upon tumours inthe groin.<pb n="5447" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxxiv. c. 33.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It can hardly be said to add to his fame.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xiv. c. 4.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. xxix. c. 36 and in c. 19 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxxii. c. 35.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ajasson remarks that this may probably be useful.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxxv. cc. 12, 13.</p></body>
