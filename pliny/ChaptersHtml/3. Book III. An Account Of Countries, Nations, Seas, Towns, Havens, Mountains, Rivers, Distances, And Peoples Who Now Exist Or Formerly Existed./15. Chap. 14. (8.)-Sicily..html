(8.)—SICILY.</head><p>But more celebrated than all is Sicily, called Sicania byThucydides, and by many writers Trinacria or Trinacia, fromits triangular appearance. According to Agrippa it is 618<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>miles in circumference. In former times it was a continuation of the territory of Bruttium, but, in consequence ofthe overflowing of the sea, became severed from it; thus forming a strait of 15 miles in length, and a mile and a half inwidth in the vicinity of the Pillar of Rhegium. It was fromthis circumstance of the land being severed asunder thatthe Greeks gave the name of Rhegium<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> to the town situateon the Italian shore.</p><p>In these Straits is the rock of Scylla, as also Charybdis<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>, awhirlpool of the sea, both of them noted for their perils. Ofthis triangle, the promontory, which, as we have already<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span><pb n="1217" />mentioned, is called Pelorus, faces Scylla and juts out towardsItaly, while Pachynum<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> extends in the direction of Greece,Peloponnesus being at a distance from it of 440 miles, andLilybæum<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>, towards Africa, being distant 180 miles from thepromontory of Mercury<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>, and from that of Caralis in Sardinia 190. These promontories and sides are situate at thefollowing distances from each other: by land it is 186 milesfrom Pelorus to Pachynum, from Pachynum to Lilybæum200, and from Lilybæum to Pelorus 170<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>.</p><p>In this island there are five colonies and sixty-three citiesor states. Leaving Pelorus and facing the Ionian Sea, wehave the town of Messana<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>, whose inhabitants are also calledMamertini and enjoy the rights of Roman citizens; thepromontory of Drepanum<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>, the colony of Tauromenium<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>,formerly called Naxos, the river Asines<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>, and Mount Ætna,wondrous for the flames which it emits by night. Its crateris twenty stadia in circumference, and from it red-hotcinders are thrown as far as Tauromenium and Catina, thenoise being heard even at Maroneum<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> and the GemellianHills. We then come to the three rocks of the Cyclopes<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>,the Port of Ulysses<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>, the colony of Catina<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span>, and the riversSymæthus<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> and Terias; while more inland lie the Læstrygonian Plains.</p><p>To these rivers succeed the towns of Leontinum<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> andMegaris, the river Pantagies<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span>, the colony of Syracuse<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span>, withthe fountain of Arethusa<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span>, (the people in the Syracusan ter-<pb n="1218" />ritory drink too of the fountains of Temenitis<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span>, Archidemia,Magæa, Cyane, and Milichie,) the port of Naustathmus<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span>, theriver Elorus, and the promontory of Pachynum. Thisside<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span> of Sicily begins with the river Hirminius<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span>, then follow the town of Camarina<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span>, the river Gelas<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span>, and the townof Agragas<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span>, which our people have named Agrigentum.

Towards Africa, its islands are Gaulos<span id="ref_79"><a href="#note_79">[79]</a></span>, Melita,87 miles from Camerina, and 113 from Lilybæum, Cosyra<span id="ref_80"><a href="#note_80">[80]</a></span>,Hieronnesos<span id="ref_81"><a href="#note_81">[81]</a></span>, Cæne<span id="ref_82"><a href="#note_82">[82]</a></span>, Galata<span id="ref_83"><a href="#note_83">[83]</a></span>, Lopadusa, Æthusa, writtenby some Ægusa, Bucinna<span id="ref_84"><a href="#note_84">[84]</a></span>, Osteodes<span id="ref_85"><a href="#note_85">[85]</a></span>, distant from Soluntum75 miles, and, opposite to Paropus, Ustica.</p><p>On this side of Sicily, facing the river Metaurus, at a di-stance of nearly 25<span id="ref_86"><a href="#note_86">[86]</a></span> miles from Italy, are the seven<span id="ref_87"><a href="#note_87">[87]</a></span> islandscalled the Æolian, as also the Liparæan islands; by theGreeks they are called the Hephæstiades, and by our writersthe Vulcanian<span id="ref_88"><a href="#note_88">[88]</a></span> Isles; they are called "Æolian" because inthe Trojan times Æolus was king there.</p><p>(9.) Lipara<span id="ref_89"><a href="#note_89">[89]</a></span>, with a town whose inhabitants enjoy therights of Roman citizens, is so called from Liparus, a formerking who succeeded<span id="ref_90"><a href="#note_90">[90]</a></span> Æolus, it having been previously calledMelogonis or Meligunis. It is 25 miles<span id="ref_91"><a href="#note_91">[91]</a></span> distant from Italy,and in circumference a little less. Between this island andSicily we find another, the name of which was formerlyTherasia, but now called Hiera, because it is sacred toVulcan<span id="ref_92"><a href="#note_92">[92]</a></span>: it contains a hill which at night vomits forth<pb n="1222" />flames. The third island is Strongyle<span id="ref_93"><a href="#note_93">[93]</a></span>, lying one mile<span id="ref_94"><a href="#note_94">[94]</a></span> tothe east of Lipara, over which Æolus reigned as well; itdiffers only from Lipara in the superior brilliancy of itsflames. From the smoke of this volcano it is said that someof the inhabitants are able to predict three days beforehandwhat winds are about to blow; hence arose the notion thatthe winds are governed by Æolus. The fourth of theseislands is Didyme<span id="ref_95"><a href="#note_95">[95]</a></span>, smaller than Lipara, the fifth Ericusa,the sixth Phœnicusa, left to be a pasture-ground for thecattle of the neighbouring islands, and the last and smallestEuonymos. Thus much as to the first great Gulf ofEurope.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Posidonius, quoted by Strabo, says 550.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Meaning that it comes from the Greek verb <foreign lang="greek">r(hlnumi,</foreign> "to break."This is probably only a fanciful origin of the name.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The present Garofalo.
