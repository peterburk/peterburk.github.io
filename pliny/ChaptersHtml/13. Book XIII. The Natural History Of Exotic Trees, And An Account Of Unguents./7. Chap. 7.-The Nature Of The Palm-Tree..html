<div2 type="chapter" n="7" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 7.—THE NATURE OF THE PALM-TREE.</head><p>The palm-tree grows in a light and sandy soil, and for themost part of a nitrous quality. It loves the vicinity of flowingwater; and as it is its nature to imbibe the whole of the year,there are some who are of opinion that in a year of droughtit will receive injury from being manured even, if the manureis not first mixed with running water: this, at least, is the ideaentertained by some of the Assyrians.</p><p>The varieties of the palm are numerous. First of all, thereare those which do not exceed the size of a shrub; they aremostly barren, though sometimes they are known to producefruit; the branches are short, and the tree is well covered withleaves all round. In many places this tree is used as a kindof rough-cast,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> as it were, to protect the walls of housesagainst damp. The palms of greater height form wholeforests, the trunk of the tree being protected all round bypointed leaves, which are arranged in the form of a comb;these, it must be understood, are wild palms, though sometimes,by some wayward fancy or other, they are known to maketheir appearance among the cultivated varieties. The otherkinds are tall, round, and tapering; and being furnished withdense and projecting knobs or circles in the bark, arranged inregular gradation, they are found easy of ascent by the peoplein the East; in order to do which, the climber fastens a loopof osier round his body and the trunk, and by this contrivanceascends the tree with astonishing<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> rapidity. All the foliage isat the summit, and the fruit as well; this last being situate,not among the leaves, as is the case with other trees, buthanging in clusters from shoots of its own among thebranches, and partaking of the nature both of the grape andthe apple. The leaves terminate in a sharp edge, like that ofa knife, while the sides are deeply indented-a peculiarity<pb n="3171" />which first gave the idea of a troop of soldiers presenting faceon two sides at once; at the present day they are split asunder<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>to form ropes and wythes for fastening, as well as light umbrellas<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> for covering the head.</p><p>The more diligent<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> enquirers into the operations of Naturestate that all trees, or rather all plants, and other productionsof the earth, belong to either one sex or the other; a factwhich it may be sufficient to notice on the present occasion,and one which manifests itself in no tree more than in thepalm. The male tree blossoms at the shoots; the female budswithout blossoming, the bud being very similar to an ear ofcorn. In both trees the flesh of the fruit shows first, andafter that the woody part inside of it, or, in other words, theseed: and that this is really the case, is proved by the fact, thatwe often find small fruit on the same shoot without any seed init at all. This seed is of an oblong shape, and not roundedlike the olive-stone. It is also divided down the back by adeep indentation, and in most specimens of this fruit thereis exactly in the middle a sort of navel, as it were, from whichthe root of the tree first takes its growth.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> In planting thisseed it is laid on its anterior surface, two being placed sideby side, while as many more are placed above; for whenplanted singly, the tree that springs up is but weak andsickly, whereas the four seeds all unite and form one strongtree. The seed is divided from the flesh of the fruit by severalcoats of a whitish colour, some of which are attached to thebody of it; it lies but loosely in the inside of the fruit, adhering only to the summit by a single thread.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span></p><p>The flesh of this fruit takes a year to ripen, though in someplaces, Cyprus<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> for instance, even if it should not reach maturity, it is very agreeable, for the sweetness of its flavour:the leaf of the tree too, in that island, is broader than elsewhere, and the fruit rounder than usual: the body of the fruit<pb n="3172" />however, is never eaten, but is always spit<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> out again, afterthe juice has been extracted. In Arabia, the palm fruit issaid to have a sickly sweet taste, although Juba says that heprefers the date found among the Arabian Scenitæ,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> and towhich they give the name of dablan," before those of anyother country for flavour. In addition to the above particulars, it is asserted that in a forest of natural growth thefemale<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> trees will become barren if they are deprived of themales, and that many female trees may be seen surrounding asingle male with downcast heads and a foliage that seems to bebowing caressingly towards it; while the male tree, on theother hand, with leaves all bristling and erect, by its exhalations, and even the very sight of it and the dust<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> fromoff it, fecundates the others: if the male tree, too, shouldhappen to be cut down, the female trees, thus reduced to a stateof widowhood, will at once become barren and unproductive.So well, indeed, is this sexual union between them understood,that it has been imagined even that fecundation may be ensured through the agency of man, by means of the blossomsand the down<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> gathered from off the male trees, and, indeed,sometimes by only sprinkling the dust from off them on thefemale trees.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Tectorii vicem."
