The bramble, by reason of its thinness and the exces-<pb n="3476" />sive length to which it grows, bends downwards, and throwsthe extremities of its branches into the earth; these immediately take root again, and would fill every place far andwide, were it not that the arts of cultivation put a check toit; so much so, indeed, that it would almost appear that menare born for nothing else but to take care of the earth. Henceit is, that a thing that is in itself most noxious and mostbaneful, has taught us the art of reproduction by layers andquicksets. The ivy, too, has a similar property.</p><p>Cato<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> says, that in addition to the vine, the fig, as well asthe olive, the pomegranate, every variety of the apple, thelaurel, the plum, the myrtle, the filbert, the nut of Præste,and the plane, are capable of being propagated by layers.</p><p>Layers<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> are of two kinds; in the one, a branch, while stilladhering to the tree, is pressed downwards into a hole thatmeasures four feet every way: at the end of two years it iscut at the part where it curves, and is then transplanted atthe expiration of three years more. If it is intended to carrythe plant to any distance, it is the best plan to place the layer,directly it is taken up, either in an osier basket or any earthenvessel, for its better security when carried. The other<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> modeof reproduction by layers is a more costly one, and is effectedby summoning forth a root from the trunk of the tree even.For this purpose, earthen vessels or baskets are provided, andare then well packed with earth; through these the extremities of the branches are passed, and by this mode of encouragement a root is obtained growing amid the fruit itself, andat the very summit of the tree; for it is at the summit thatthis method is generally adopted. In this way has a bold anddaring inventiveness produced a new tree aloft and far awayfrom the ground. At the end of two years, in the manneralready stated, the layer is cut asunder, and then planted inthe ground, basket and all.</p><p>The herb savin<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> is reproduced by layers, as also by slips; it<pb n="3477" />is said, too, that lees of wine or pounded wall-bricks make itthrive wonderfully well. Rosemary<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> also is reproduced in asimilar manner, as also from cuttings of the branches; neithersavin nor rosemary having any seed. The rhododendrum<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> ispropagated by layers and from seed.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">De Re Rust. c. 51.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The French call cultivation by layers "marcotte," as applied to treesin general; and " provignage," as applicable to the vine.
