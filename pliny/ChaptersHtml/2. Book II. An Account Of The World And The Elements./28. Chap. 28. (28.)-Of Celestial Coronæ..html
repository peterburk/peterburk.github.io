(28.)—OF CELESTIAL CORONÆ.</head><p>Stars are occasionally seen along with the sun, for wholedays together, and generally round its orb, like wreaths madeof the ears of corn, or circles of various colours<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>; such asoccurred when Augustus, while a very young man, wasentering the city, after the death of his father, in order totake upon himself the great name which he assumed<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>. (29.)The same <hi rend="ital">coronæ</hi> occur about the moon and also about theprincipal stars, which are stationary in the heavens.<pb n="1062" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It would appear that, in this passage, two phenomena are confoundedtogether; certain brilliant stars, as, for example, Venus, which have beenoccasionally seen in the day-time, and the formation of different kinds ofhalos, depending on certain states of the atmosphere, which affect itstransparency.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This occurrence is mentioned by Seneca, Nat. Quæst. i. 2; he entersinto a detailed explanation of the cause; also by V. Paterculus, ii. 59,and by Jul. Obsequens, cap. 128. We can scarcely doubt of the realityof the occurrence, as these authors would not have ventured to relatewhat, if not true, might have been so easily contradicted.</p></body>
