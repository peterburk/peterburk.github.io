(2.)ÑWHEN ELEPHANTS WERE FIRST PUT INTO HARNESS.</head><p>The first harnessed elephants that were seen at Rome, werein the triumph of Pompeius Magnus over Africa, when theydrew his chariot; a thing that is said to have been done longbefore, at the triumph of Father Liber on the conquest ofIndia. Procilius<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> says, that those which were used at thetriumph of Pompeius, were unable to go in harness throughthe gate of the city. In the exhibition of gladiators whichwas given by Germanicus,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> the elephants performed a sort ofdance with their uncouth and irregular movements. It was acommon thing to see them throw arrows with such strength,that the wind was unable to turn them from their course, toimitate among themselves the combats of the gladiators, andto frolic through the steps of the Pyrrhic dance.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> After this,<pb n="2246" />too, they walked upon the tight-rope,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and four of them wouldcarry a litter in which lay a fifth, which represented a womanlying-in. They afterwards took their place; and so nicely didthey manage their steps, that they did not so much as touchany of those who were drinking there.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Plutarch informs us, that Pompey had resolved to have his chariotdrawn by four elephants, but finding the gate too narrow, he was obligedto use horses.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See an account of this, and of the feats performed by the elephants, in®lian, Hist.
