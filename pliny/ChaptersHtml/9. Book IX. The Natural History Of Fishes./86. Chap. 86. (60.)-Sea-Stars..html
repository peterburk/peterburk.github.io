(60.)ÑSEA-STARS.</head><p>In addition to what I have already stated, I find that authors,distinguished for their wisdom, express surprise at finding astar in the sea-for such, in fact, is the form of the animal,which has but very little flesh<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> within, and nothing but ahard skin without. It is said that in this fish there is sucha fiery heat, that it scorches everything it meets with inthe sea, and instantaneously digests its food. By what experiments<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> all this came to be known, I cannot so easily say;but I am about to make mention of one fact which is more remarkable still, and which we have the opportunity of testingby every day's experience.<pb n="2475" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier says, that the star-fish, the Asterias of Linn¾us, is coveredwith a callous shell without, and has within only the viscera and the ovaria,apparently without any muscles. Aristotle reckons it among the fisheswhich he calls <foreign lang="greek">o)strakode/rmata,</foreign> or hard-shelled fish; while, on the otherhand, ®lian, Hist. Anim. B. xi. c. 22, reckons it among the <foreign lang="greek">malako/straka,</foreign>or soft-shelled fish.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier says, that Pliny has good reason to say that he does not knowupon what authority this power has been attributed to the star-fish; as itis altogether fabulous.</p></body>
