<div2 type="chapter" n="38" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 38.—THE COMPARATIVE DISTANCES OF PLACES ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH.</head><p>Having now fully described the earth, both without<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> aswell as within, it seems only proper that we should succinctlystate the length and breadth of its various seas.</p><p>(33.) Polybius has stated, that in a straight line from theStraits of Gades to the mouth of the Mæotis, it is a distance of<pb n="2109" />three thousand four hundred and thirty-seven miles and a half,and that, starting from the same point,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> the distance in astraight line to Sicily is twelve hundred and fifty miles, fromthence to Crete three hundred and seventy-five, to Rhodes onehundred and eighty-seven and a half, to the Chelidonian Islandsthe same distance, to Cyprus two hundred and twenty-five,and from thence to Seleucia Pieria, in Syria, one hundred andfifteen miles: the sum of all which distances amounts to twothousand three hundred and forty miles. Agrippa estimatesthis same distance, in a straight line from the Straits of Gadesto the Gulf of Issus, at three thousand three hundred and fortymiles; in which computation, however, I am not certain thatthere is not some error in the figures, seeing that the sameauthor has stated that the distance from the Straits of Sicily toAlexandria is thirteen hundred and fifty miles. Taking thewhole length of the sea-line throughout the gulfs above-men-tioned, and beginning at the same point,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> he makes it tenthousand and fifty-eight miles; to which number Artemidorushas added seven hundred and fifty-six: the same author, including in his calculation the shores of the Mæotis, makes thewhole distance seventeen thousand three hundred and ninetymiles. Such is the measurement given by men who havepenetrated into distant countries, unaided by force of arms,and have, with a boldness that exhibits itself in the times ofpeace even, challenged, as it were, Fortune herself.</p><p>I shall now proceed to compare the dimensions of the variousparts of the earth, however great the difficulties which mayarise from the discrepancy of the accounts given by variousauthors: the most convenient method, however, will be thatof adding the breadth to the length.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> Following this modeof reckoning, the dimensions of Europe will be eight thousand two hundred and ninety-four miles; of Africa, to adopta mean between all the various accounts given by authors, thelength is three thousand seven hundred and ninety-four miles,while the breadth, so far as it is inhabited, in no part exceeds<pb n="2110" />two hundred and fifty miles.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> But, as Agrippa, including itsdeserts, makes it from Cyrenaica, a part of it, to the country ofthe Garamantes, so far as was then known, a further distance ofnine hundred and ten miles, the entire length, added together,will make a distance of four thousand six hundred and eightmiles. The length of Asia is generally admitted<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> to be sixthousand three hundred and seventy-five miles, and the breadth,which ought, properly, to be reckoned from the Æthiopian Seato Alexandria,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> near the river Nile, so as to run through Meroëand Syene, is eighteen hundred and seventy-five. It appearsthen that Europe is greater than Asia, by a little less than onehalf of Asia, and greater than Africa by as much again of Africaand one-sixth. If all these sums are added together, it willbe clearly seen that Europe is one-third, and a little more thanone-eighth part of one-third, Asia one-fourth and one-four-teenth part of one-fourth, and Africa, one-fifth and one-sixtiethpart of one-fifth of the whole earth.<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hardouin takes this to mean, both as to the continent, with theplaces there situate, and the seas, with the islands there found; the continent being the interior, and the seas the exterior part. It is much morelikely, however, that his description of the <hi rend="ital">interior</hi> of the earth is thatgiven in the 2nd Book, while the account of the exterior is set forth in thegeographical notices contained in the 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Straits of Gades or Cadiz.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Straits of Gades.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Littré has the following remark: "Is it possible that Pliny can haveimagined that the extent of a surface could be ascertained by adding thelength to the breadth?" It is just possible that such may not have beenhis meaning; but it seems quite impossible to divine what it was.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He means to say that the interior is not inhabited beyond a distanceof 250 miles from the sea-coast.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. v. c. 9.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He is probably speaking only of that part of Asia which includedEgypt, on the eastern side of the river Nile, according to ancient geography.His mode, however, of reckoning the breadth of Asia, <hi rend="ital">i.e.</hi> from south tonorth, is singular. See p. 104.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">On a rough calculation, these aliquot parts in all would make 4/4 2/2 6/9 4/0 3/0parts of the unit. It is not improbable that the figures given above as thedimensions are incorrect, as they do not agree with the fractional resultshere given by Pliny.</p></body>
