<div2 type="chapter" n="74" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 74.—THE VARIOUS KINDS OF EGGS, AND THEIR NATURE.</head><p>Some eggs are white, as those of the pigeon and partridge,<pb n="2533" />for instance; others are of a pale colour, as in the aquaticbirds: others, again, are dotted all over with spots, as is thecase with those of the meleagris; others are red, like those ofthe pheasant and the cenchris. In the inside, the eggs of allbirds are of two colours; those of the aquatic kind have moreof the yellow than the white, and the yellow is of a paler tintthan in those of other birds. Among fish, the eggs are of thesame colour throughout, there being, in fact, no white. Theeggs of birds are of a brittle nature, in consequence of thenatural heat of the animal, while those of serpents are supple,in consequence of their coldness, and those of fish soft, fromtheir natural humidity. Again, the eggs of aquatic birds areround, while those of most other kinds are elongated, and taperto a point. Eggs are laid with the round end foremost, andat the moment that they are laid the shell is soft, but it immediately grows hard, as each portion becomes exposed to the air.Horatius Flaccus<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> expresses it as his opinion that those eggswhich are of an oblong shape are of the most agreeable flavour.The rounder eggs are those which produce<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> the female, theothers the male. The umbilical<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> cord is in the upper partof the egg, like a drop floating on the surface in the shell.</p><p>(53.) There are some birds that couple at all seasons of theyear, barn-door fowls, for instance; they lay, too, at all times,with the exception of two months at mid-winter. Pullets laymore eggs than the older hens, but then they are smaller. Inthe same brood those chickens are the smallest that arehatched the first and the last. These animals, indeed, are soprolific, that some of them will lay as many as sixty eggs,some daily, some twice a day, and some in such vast numbersthat they have been known to die from exhaustion. Thoseknown as the "Adrianæ,"<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> are the most esteemed. Pigeonssit ten times a year, and some of them eleven, and in Egyptduring the month of the winter solstice even. Swallows,<pb n="2534" />blackbirds, ring-doves, and turtle-doves sit twice a year, mostother birds only once. Thrushes make their nests of mud, inthe tops of trees, almost touching one another, and lay duringthe time of their retirement. The egg comes to maturity in theovary ten days after treading; but if the hen or pigeon is tormented by pulling out the feathers, or by the infliction of anyinjury of a similar nature, the maturing of the egg is retarded.</p><p>In the middle of the yolk of every egg there is what appears to be a little drop<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> of blood; this is supposed to bethe heart of the chicken, it being the general belief that thatpart is formed the first in every animal: at all events, whilein the egg this speck is seen to throb and palpitate. The bodyof the animal itself is formed from the white fluid<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> in theegg; while the yellow part constitutes its food. The head inevery kind, while in the shell, is larger than the rest of thebody; the eyes, too, are closed, and are larger than the otherparts of the head. As the chicken grows, the white graduallypasses to the middle of the egg, while the yellow is spreadaround it. On the twentieth day, if the egg is shaken, thevoice of the now living animal can be heard in the shell. Fromthis time it gradually becomes clothed with feathers; and itsposition is such that it has the head above the right foot, andthe right wing above the head: the yolk in the meantimegradually disappears. All birds are born with the feet first,while with every other animal the contrary is the case. Somehens lay all their eggs with two yolks, and sometimes hatchtwin chickens from the same egg, one being larger than theother, according to Cornelius Celsus: other writers, however,deny<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> the possibility of twin chickens being hatched. It isa rule never to give a brood hen more than twenty-five<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> eggsto sit upon at once. Hens begin to lay immediately after thewinter solstice. The best broods are those which are hatched<pb n="2535" />before the vernal equinox: chickens that are hatched after thesummer solstice, never attain their full growth, and the moreso, the later they are produced.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">B. ii.
