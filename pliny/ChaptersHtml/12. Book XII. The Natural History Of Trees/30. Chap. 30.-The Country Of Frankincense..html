The chief productionsof Arabia are frankincense and myrrh, which last it bears in<pb n="3124" />common with the country of the Troglodytæ. (14.) There isno country in the world that produces frankincense exceptArabia,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and, indeed, not the whole of that. Almost in thevery centre of that region, are the Atramitæ,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> a community ofthe Sabæi, the capital of whose kingdom is Sabota, a placesituate on a lofty mountain. At a distance of eight stationsfrom this is the incense-bearing region, known by the nameof Saba. The Greeks say that the word signifies a "secretmystery." This district looks towards the north-east, andis rendered inaccessible by rocks on every side, while it isbounded on the right by the sea, from which it is shut out bycliffs of tremendous height. The soil of this territory is saidto be of a milky white, a little inclining to red. The forestsextend twenty schœni in length, and half that distance inbreadth. The length of the schœnus, according to the estimate of Eratosthenes, is forty stadia, or, in other words, fivemiles; some persons, however, have estimated the schœnus atno more than thirty-two stadia. In this district some loftyhills take their rise, and the trees, which spring up spontaneously, run downwards along the declivities to the plains.It is generally agreed that the soil is argillaceous, and thatthe springs which there take their rise are but few in number,and of a nitrous quality. Adjoining are the Minæi, the peopleof another community, through whose country is the sole transit for the frankincense, along a single narrow road. The<pb n="3125" />Minæi were the first people who carried on any traffic infrankincense, which they still do to a greater extent than anyother persons, and hence it is that it has received the appellation of "Minæan." It is the Sabæi alone, and no otherpeople among the Arabians, that behold the incense-tree; and,indeed, not all of them, for it is said that there are not morethan three thousand families which have a right to claim thatprivilege, by virtue of hereditary succession; and that for thisreason those persons are called sacred, and are not allowed,while pruning the trees or gathering the harvest, to receiveany pollution, either by intercourse with women, or coming incontact with the dead; by these religious observances it isthat the price of the commodity is so considerably enhanced.Some persons, however, say, that the right of gathering incense in the forests belongs to all these people in common,while others again state, that they take their turns year byyear.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See c. 42 of the present Book.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Virgil, Georg. B. ii. 1. 139, mentions Panchaia, in Arabia, as beingmore especially the country of frankincense. That region corresponds withthe modern Yemen. It is, however, a well-ascertained fact, that it growsin India as well, and it is supposed that the greater part of it used bythe ancients was in reality imported from that country. The Indian incense is the product of a tree belonging to the terebinth class, named byRoxburgh, who first discovered it, Boswellia thurifera. It is more especially found in the mountainous parts of India. On the other hand, it hasbeen asserted that the Arabian incense was the product of a coniferous tree,either the Juniperus Lycia, the Juniperus Phœnicea, or the Juniperusthurifera of Linnæus. But, as Fée justly remarks, it would appear morereasonable to look among the terebinths of Arabia for the incense tree, ifone of that class produces it in India, and more especially because the coniferous trees produce only resins, while the terebinths produce gum resins,to which class of vegetable products frankincense evidently belonged. Incommerce, the gum resin, Olibanum, the produce of the Boswellia serrata,and imported from the Levant, bears the name of frankincense.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. vi. c. 32.
