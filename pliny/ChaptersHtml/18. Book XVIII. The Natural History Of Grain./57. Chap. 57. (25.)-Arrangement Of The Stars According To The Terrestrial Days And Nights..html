<div2 type="chapter" n="57" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 57. (25.)—ARRANGEMENT OF THE STARS ACCORDING TO THETERRESTRIAL DAYS AND NIGHTS.</head><p>In the first place, it is almost an utter impossibility tocalculate with a fair degree of accuracy the days of the year andthe movements of the sun. To the three hundred and sixty-five daysthere are still to be added the intercalary days, theresult of the additional quarters of a day and night: hence itis, that it is found impossible to ascertain with exactness theproper periods for the appearance of the stars. To this wemust add, too, a certain degree of uncertainty connected withthese matters, that is universally admitted; thus, for instance,bad and wintry weather will often precede, by several days,the proper period for the advent of that season, a state of thingsknown to the Greeks as <foreign lang="greek">proxeima/zein;</foreign><span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> while at another time,it will last longer than usual, a state of circumstances known as<foreign lang="greek">e)pixeima/zein.</foreign><span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> The effects, too, of the changes thattake placein the seasons will sometimes be felt later, and at other timesearlier, upon their reaching the face of the earth; and we notunfrequently hear the remark made, upon the return of fineweather, that the action of such and such a constellation isnow completed.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> And then, again, as all these phænomenadepend upon certain stars, arranged and regulated in the vault ofheaven, we find intervening, in accordance with the movementsof certain stars, hailstorms and showers, themselves productiveof no slight results, as we have already observed,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and apt tointerfere with the anticipated regular recurrence of the seasons.Nor are we to suppose that these disappointments fall upon thehuman race only, for other animated beings, as well as ourselves,<pb n="4075" />are deceived in regard to them, although endowed with even agreater degree of sagacity upon these points than we are, fromthe fact of their very existence depending so materially uponthem. Hence it is, that we sometimes see the summer birdskilled by too late or too early cold, and the winter birds byheat coming out of the usual season. It is for this reason,that Virgil<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> has recommended us to study the courses of theplanets, and has particularly warned us to watch the passageof the cold star Saturn.</p><p>There are some who look upon the appearance of the butterfly as the surest sign of spring, because of the extreme delicacyof that insect. In this present year,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> however, in which Iam penning these lines, it has been remarked that the flightsof butterflies have been killed three several times, by as manyreturns of the cold; while the foreign birds, which broughtus by the sixth of the calends of February<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> every indicationof an early spring, after that had to struggle against a winterof the greatest severity. In treating of these matters, we haveto meet a twofold difficulty: first of all, we have to ascertainwhether or not the celestial phænomena are regulated bycertain laws, and then we have to seek how to reconcile thoselaws with apparent facts. We must, however, be more particularlycareful to take into account the convexity of the earth,and the differences of situation in the localities upon the faceof the globe; for hence it is, that the same constellation showsitself to different nations at different times, the result being,that its influence is by no means perceptible everywhere at thesame moment. This difficulty has been considerably enhanced,too, by various authors, who, after making their observationsin different localities, and indeed, in some instances, in the samelocality, have yet given us varying or contradictory results.</p><p>There have been three great schools of astronomy, the Chaldæan,the Ægyptian, and the Grecian. To these has beenadded a fourth school, which was established by the DictatorCæsar among ourselves, and to which was entrusted the dutyof regulating the year in conformity with the sun's revolution,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>under the auspices of Sosigenes, an astronomer of considerablelearning and skill. His theory, too, upon the discovery of certainerrors, has since been corrected, no intercalations having<pb n="4076" />been made for twelve<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> successive years, upon its being foundthat the year which before had anticipated the constellations,was now beginning to fall behind them. Even Sosigenes himself, too,though more correct than his predecessors, has nothesitated to show, by his continual corrections in the threeseveral treatises which he composed, that he still entertainedgreat doubts on the subject. The writers, too, whose names areinserted at the beginning of this work,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> have sufficientlyrevealed the fact of these discrepancies, the opinions of one beingrarely found to agree with those of another. This, however,is less surprising in the case of those whose plea is the differenceof the localities in which they wrote. But with reference tothose who, though living in the same country, have still arrivedat different results, we shall here mention one remarkableinstance of discrepancy. Hesiod—for under his name, also,we have a treatise extant on the Science of the Stars<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>—hasstated that the morning setting of theVergiliæ takes place atthe moment of the autumnal equinox; whereas Thales, wefind, makes it the twenty-fifth day after the equinox, Anaximanderthe twenty-ninth, and Euctemon the forty-eighth.</p><p>As for ourselves, we shall follow the calculations made byJulius Cæsar,<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> which bear reference more particularly to Italy;though at the same time, we shall set forth the dicta of variousother writers, bearing in mind that we are treating not of anindividual country, but of Nature considered in her totality.In doing this, however, we shall name, not the writers themselves,for that would be too lengthy a task, but the countriesin reference to which they speak. The reader must bear inmind, then, that for the sake of saving space, under the headof Attica, we include the islands of the Cyclades as well; underthat of Macedonia, Magnesia and Thracia; under that of Egypt,<pb n="4077" />Phœnice, Cyprus, and Cilicia; under that of Bœotia, Locris,Phocis, and the adjoining countries; under that of Hellespont,Chersonesus, and the contiguous parts as far as Mount Athos;under that of Ionia, Asia<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> and the islands of Asia; under thatof Peloponnesus, Achaia, and the regions lying to the west ofit. Chaldæa, when mentioned, will signify Assyria and Babylonia, as well.</p><p>My silence as to Africa,<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> Spain, and the provinces of Gaul,will occasion no surprise, from the fact that no one has publishedany observations made upon the stars in those countries.Still, however, there will be no difficulty in calculating them,even for these regions as well, on reference being made to theparallels which have been set forth in the Sixth Book.<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> Byadopting this course, an accurate acquaintance may be madewith the astronomical relations, not only of individual nations,but of cities even as well. By taking the circular parallelswhich we have there appended to the several portions of theearth respectively, and applying them to the countries in question,that are similarly situate, it will be found that the risingof the heavenly bodies will be the same for all parts withinthose parallels, where the shadows projected are of equal length.It is also deserving of remark, that the seasons have theirperiodical recurrences, without any marked difference, everyfour years, in consequence of the influence<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> of the sun, and thatthe characteristics of the seasons are developed in excess everyeighth year, at the revolution of every hundredth moon.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"To be an early winter."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"To be a long winter."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Confectum sidus.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. xvii. c. 2.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Georg. i 335.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A.U.C. 830.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Twenty-seventh of January.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ad solis cursum.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Soon after the corrections made by order of Julius Cæsar, thePontifices mistook the proper method of intercalation, by making iteverythird year instead of the fourth; the consequence of which was, thatAugustus was obliged to correct the results of their error by omitting theintercalary day for twelve years.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He most probably refers to the list of writers originally appended tothe First Book; but which in the present Translation is distributed at theend of each Book.
