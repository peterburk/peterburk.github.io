<div2 type="chapter" n="56" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 56.—THE HAIR OF THE EYE-LIDS; WHAT ANIMALS AREWITHOUT THEM. ANIMALS WHICH CAN SEE ON ONE SIDE ONLY.</head><p>Man has lashes on the eye-lids on either side; and womeneven make it their daily care to stain them;<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> so ardent are theyin the pursuit of beauty, that they must even colour theirvery eyes. It was with another view, however, that Naturehad provided the hair of the eyelids—they were to have acted,so to say, as a kind of rampart for the protection of the sight,and as an advanced bulwark against the approach of insectsor other objects which might accidentally come in their way.It is not without some reason that it is said that the eye-lashes<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> fall off with those persons who are too much given tovenereal pleasures. Of the other animals, the only ones thathave eyelashes are those that have hair on the rest of thebody as well; but the quadrupeds have them on the upper<pb n="3055" />eyelid only, and the birds on the lower one: the same is thecase also with those which have a soft skin, such as the serpent,and those among the quadrupeds that are oviparous, the lizard,for instance. The ostrich is the only one among the birdsthat, like man, has eyelashes on either side.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Kohl is still used in the east for the same purpose.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle says so, Hist.
