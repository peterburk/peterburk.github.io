(6.)â€”AT WHAT PERIOD MARBLE WAS FIRST USED INBUILDINGS.</head><p>This must suffice for the sculptors in marble, and the worksthat have gained the highest repute; with reference to whichsubject it occurs to me to remark, that spotted marbles were notthen in fashion. In making their statues, these artists used themarble of Thasos also,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> one of the Cyclades, and of Lesbos, thislast being rather more livid than the other. The poet Menander,in fact, who was a very careful enquirer into all matters ofluxury, is the first who has spoken, and that but rarely, of variegatedmarbles, and, indeed, of the employment of marble ingeneral. Columns of this material were at first employed intemples, not on grounds of superior elegance, (for that was notthought of, as yet), but because no material could be found ofa more substantial nature. It was under these circumstances,that the Temple<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> of the Olympian Jupiter was commenced atAthens, the columns of which were brought by Sylla to Rome,for the buildings in the Capitol.</p><p>Still, however, there had been a distinction drawn betweenordinary stone and marble, in the days of Homer even. Thepoet speaks in one passage of a person<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> being struck downwith a huge mass of marble; but that is all; and when hedescribes the abodes of royalty adorned with every elegance,besides brass, gold, electrum,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and silver, he only mentionsivory. Variegated marbles, in my opinion, were first discoveredin the quarries of Chios, when the inhabitants werebuilding the walls of their city; a circumstance which gaverise to a facetious repartee on the part of M. Cicero. It beingthe practice with them to show these walls to everybody, as<pb n="6324" />something magnificent; "I should admire them much more,"said he, "if you had built them of the stone used at Tibur."<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>And, by Hercules! the art of painting<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> never would havebeen held in such esteem, or, indeed, in any esteem at all, ifvariegated marbles had been held in admiration.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">As well as that of Paros.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Only completed in the time of the Emperor Adrian.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cebriones, the charioteer of Hector.
