<div2 type="chapter" n="4" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 4.—THAT PRODIGIES AND PORTENTS MAY BE CONFIRMED, ORMADE OF NO EFFECT.</head><p>L. Piso informs us, in the first Book of his Annals, that KingTullus Hostilius,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> while attempting, in accordance with thebooks of Numa, to summon Jupiter from heaven by means of asacrifice similar to that employed by him, was struck bylightning in consequence of his omission to follow certainforms with due exactness. Many other authors, too, haveattested, that by the power of words a change has beeneffected in destinies and portents of the greatest importance.While they were digging on the Tarpeian Hill for the foundations of a temple, a human head was found; upon which deputies were sent to Olenus Calenus, the most celebrateddiviner of Etruria. He, foreseeing the glory and success which<pb n="5281" />attached to such a presage as this, attempted, by putting aquestion to them, to transfer the benefit of it to his ownnation. First describing, on the ground before him, the outlineof a temple with his staff—"Is it so, Romans, as you say?"said he; "here then must be the temple<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> of Jupiter, all goodand all powerful; it is here that we have found the head"—and the constant asseveration of the Annals is, that the destinyof the Roman empire would have been assuredly transferred toEtruria, had not the deputies, forewarned by the son of thediviner, made answer—"No, not here exactly, but at Rome,we say, the head was found."</p><p>It is related also that the same was the case when a certainfour-horse chariot, made of clay, and intended for the roof ofthe same temple, had considerably increased while in thefurnace;<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and that on this occasion, in a similar manner, thedestinies of Rome were saved. Let these instances sufficethen to show, that the virtues of presages lie in our own hands,and that they are valuable in each instance according as theyare received.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> At all events, it is a principle in the doctrineof the augurs, that neither imprecations nor auspices of anykind have any effect upon those who, when entering upon anundertaking, declare that they will pay no attention whateverto them; a greater instance than which, of the indulgent disposition of the gods towards us, cannot be found.</p><p>And then besides, in the laws themselves of the TwelveTables, do we not read the following words—"Whosoever shallhave enchanted the harvest,"<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> and in another place, "Whosoever shall have used pernicious incantations"?<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> Verrius Flaccus cites authors whom he deems worthy of credit, to showthat on the occasion of a siege, it was the usage, the first thing ofall, for the Roman priests to summon forth the tutelary divinityof that particular town, and to promise him the same rites, oreven a more extended worship, at Rome; and at the present dayeven, this ritual still forms part of the discipline of our pontiffs.<pb n="5282" />Hence it is, no doubt, that the name<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> of the tutelary deity ofRome has been so strictly kept concealed, lest any of our enemiesshould act in a similar manner. There is no one, too, who doesnot dread being spell-bound by means of evil imprecations;<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> andhence the practice, after eating eggs or snails, of immediately breaking<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> the shells, or piercing them with the spoon.Hence, too, those love-sick imitations of enchantments whichwe find described by Theocritus among the Greeks, and byCatullus, and more recently, Virgil,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> among our own writers.Many persons are fully persuaded that articles of pottery maybe broken by a similar agency; and not a few are of opinioneven that serpents can counteract incantations, and that this isthe only kind of intelligence they possess—so much so, in fact,that by the agency of the magic spells of the Marsi, they maybe attracted to one spot, even when asleep in the middle of thenight. Some people go so far, too, as to write certain words<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>on the walls of houses, deprecatory of accident by fire.</p><p>But it is not easy to say whether the outlandish and unpronounceable words that are thus employed, or the Latin expressions that are used at random, and which must appearridiculous to our judgment, tend the most strongly to staggerour belief-seeing that the human imagination is always conceiving something of the infinite, something deserving of thenotice of the divinity, or indeed, to speak more correctly, something that must command his intervention perforce. Homer<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>tells us that Ulysses arrested the flow of blood from a wound<pb n="5283" />in the thigh, by repeating a charm; and Theophrastus<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> saysthat sciatica may be cured by similar means. Cato<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> haspreserved a formula for the cure of sprains, and M. Varro forthat of gout. The Dictator Cæsar, they say, having on oneoccasion accidentally had a fall in his chariot,<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> was always inthe habit, immediately upon taking his seat, of thrice repeatinga certain formula, with the view of ensuring safety upon thejourney; a thing that, to my own knowledge, is done by manypersons at the present day.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It has been suggested that Tullus Hostilius was acquainted with someof the secrets of electricity, and that he met his death while trying experiments with a lightning conductor.
