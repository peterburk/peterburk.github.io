<div2 type="chapter" n="35" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 35. (21.)—THE CULTURE OF THE VINE AND THE VARIOUSSHRUBS WHICH SUPPORT IT.</head><p>Having now described what we may call the armoury<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> of<pb n="3496" />the vine, it remains for us to treat with a particular degree ofcare of the nature of the vine itself.</p><p>The shoots of the vine, as also of certain other trees, theinterior of which is naturally of a spongy quality, have certainknots or joints upon the stem that intercept the pith. The intervals between these joints in the branches are short, andmore particularly so towards the extremities. The pith, initself the vivifying spirit of the tree, is always taking anonward direction, so long as the knot, by being open in thecentre, allows it a free passage. If, however, the knot shouldbecome solidified and deny it a passage, the pith is then throwndownward upon the knot that lies next below it, and makingits escape, issues forth there in the shape of a bud, these budsalways making their appearance on each side alternately, asalready mentioned in the case of the reed and the giant-fennel;<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> in other words, here one bud makes its appearanceat the bottom of a knot to the right, the next one takes its placeon the left, and so on alternately. In the vine this bud is knownas the "gem,"<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> as soon as the pith has formed there a smallround knob; but before it has done this, the concavity that isleft upon the surface is merely called the "eye:"<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> when situateat the extremity of the shoot, it is known as the " germ."<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>It is in the same way, too, that the stock branches, suckers,grapes, leaves, and tendrils of the vine are developed: and itis a very surprising tact, that all that grows on the right<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>side of the tree is stronger and stouter than on the left.</p><p>Hence it is, that when slips of this tree are planted, it isnecessary to cut these knots in the middle, in order to preventthe pith from making its escape. In the same way, too,when planting the fig, suckers are taken, nine inches in length,and after the ground is opened they are planted with the partdownwards that grew nearest to the tree, and with a couple ofeyes protruding from the earth—in slips of trees, that part isproperly called the eye which is to give birth to the: futurebud. It is for this reason that, in the seed-plots even the<pb n="3497" />slips that are thus planted sometimes bear the same year thefruit that they would have borne if they had remained uponthe tree: this takes place when they have been planted ingood seasons and are replete with fecundity, for then theybring to maturity the fruits the conception of which was commenced in another spot. Fig-trees that are thus planted mayvery easily be transplanted in the third year. As some compensation for the rapidity with which this tree becomes<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> old,it has thus received the privilege of coming to maturity<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> at avery early period.</p><p>The vine throws out a great number of shoots. In the firstplace, however, none of them are ever used for planting,except those which are useless, and would have been cut awayas mere brushwood; while, on the other hand, every part ispruned off that has borne fruit the previous year. In formertimes, it was the custom to plant the slip with a head at theextremity, consisting of a piece of the hard wood on each sideof it, the same, in fact, that is called a mallet shoot<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> at thepresent day. In more recent times, however, the practicehas been adopted of pulling it off merely with a heel attachedto it, as in the fig;<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> and there is no kind of slip that takeswith greater certainty. A third method, again, has been addedto the former ones, and a more simple one as well, that oftaking the slip without any heel at all. These slips areknown by the name of arrow-<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> shoots, when they are twistedbefore planting; and the same, when they are neither cutshort nor twisted, are called three-budded<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> slips. The samesucker very often furnishes several slips of this kind. Toplant a stock-shoot<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> of the vine is unproductive, and, indeed,no shoots will bear unless they are taken from a part that hasborne fruit already. A slip that has but few knots upon it, islooked upon as likely not to bear; while a great number ofbuds is considered an indication of fruitfulness. Some personssay that no suckers ought to be planted, but those which havealready blossomed. It is far from advantageous<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> to plant<pb n="3498" />arrow-slips, for after being twisted, they are apt to break intransplanting. The slips when planted should be a foot inlength,<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> and not less, and they ought to have five or six knotsupon them; with the dimensions above stated, they cannot,however, possibly have less than three buds. It is consideredthe most advantageous plan to plant them out the same daythat they are cut; but if it is found necessary to plant themsome time after, they should be kept in the way that we havealready mentioned;<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> particular care being taken not to letthem protrude from the earth, lest they should become driedby the action of the sun, or nipped by the wind or frost.When they have been kept too long in a dry place, they mustbe put in water for several days, for the purpose of restoringtheir verdancy and freshness.</p><p>The spot selected, whether for nursery or vineyard, oughtto be exposed to the sun, and of as great extent as possible;the soil being turned up to a depth of three feet with a two-pronged fork. The earth, on being thrown up with the mattock,<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> swells naturally,<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> and ridges are formed with it four feetin height, intersected by trenches a couple<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> of feet in depth.The earth in the trenches is carefully cleansed and raked out,<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span>so that none of it may be left unbroken, care being taken alsoto keep it exactly level; if the ridges are unequal, it showsthat the ground has been badly dug. At the same time thebreadth should be measured of each ridge that lies betweenthe trenches. The slips are planted either in holes or else inelongated furrows, and then covered with very fine earth;but where it is a light soil, the grower will lose his painsshould he neglect to place a layer of richer mould beneath.Not less than a couple of slips should be planted together,keeping them exactly on a level with the adjoining earth,which should be pressed down and made compact with thedibble. In the seed-plot there should be intervals left betweeneach two settings a foot and a half in breadth and half a footin length: when thus planted, it is usual, at the end of twoyears, to cut the mallet-shoots at the knot nearest the ground,<pb n="3499" />unless there is some good reason for sparing them. When thisis done, they throw out eyes, and with these upon them at theend of three years the quicksets are transplanted.</p><p>There is another method, also, of planting<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> the vine, whicha luxurious refinement in these matters has introduced. Fourmallet-shoots are tightly fastened together with a cord in tilegreenest part, and when thus arranged are passed through theshank-bone of an ox or else a tube of baked earth, after whichthey are planted in the ground, care being taken to leave acouple of buds protruding: in this way they become impregnated with moisture, and, immediately on being cut, throw outfresh wood. The tube is then broken, upon which the root,thus set at liberty, assumes fresh vigour, and the clusters<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> ultimately bear upon them grapes belonging to the four kindsthus planted together.</p><p>In consequence of a more recent discovery, another methodhas been adopted. A mallet-shoot is split down the middleand the pith extracted, after which the two portions are fastenedtogether, every care being taken not to injure the buds. Themallet-shoot is then planted in a mixture of earth and manure,and when it begins to throw out branches it is cut, the groundbeing repeatedly dug about it. Columella<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span> assures us that thegrapes of this plant will have no stones, but it is a more surprising thing that the slip itself should survive when thus deprived of the pith.<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span> Still, however, I think I ought not toomit the fact that there are some slips that grow without the ordinary articulations of trees upon them; thus, for instance, fiveor six very small sprigs of box<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span> if tied together and put inthe ground, will take root. It was formerly made a point totake these sprigs from a box-tree that had not been lopped, asit was fancied that in the last case they would not live; experience, however, has since put an end to that notion.</p><p>The culture of the vineyard naturally follows the trainingof the nursery. There are five<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span> different kinds of vine: that<pb n="3500" />with the branches running<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span> along the ground, the vine thatstands without support,<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span> the vine that is propped and requires no cross-piece,<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span> the vine that is propped and requiresa single cross-piece, and the vine that requires a trellis of fourcompartments.<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span> The mode of cultivation requisite for thepropped vine may be understood as equally adapted to the onethat stands by itself and requires no support, for this last method is only employed where there is a scarcity of wood for stays.The stay with the single cross-piece in a straight line is knownby the name of "canterius." It is the best of all for thewine, for then the tree throws no shadow, and the grape isripened continuously by the sun, while, at the same time, itderives more advantage from the action of the wind, and disengages the dew with greater facility: the superfluous leavesand shoots, too, are more easily removed, and the breaking upof the earth and other operations about the tree are effectedwith greater facility. But, above all, by the adoption of thismethod, the tree sheds its blossoms more beneficially thanunder any other circumstances. This cross-piece is generallymade of a stake, or a reed, or else of a rope of hair or hemp,as is usually the case in Spain and at Brundisium. When thetrellis is employed, wine is produced in greater quantities;this method has its name of "compluviata" from the "compluvium" or square opening in the roofs of our houses; thetrellis is divided into four compartments by as many crosspieces. This mode of planting the vine will now be treatedof, and it will be found equally applicable to every kind, withthe only difference that under this last method the operationis somewhat more complicated.</p><p>The vine is planted three different ways; in a soil that hasbeen turned up with the spade-the best of the three; in furrows, which is the next best; and in holes, the least advisablemethod of all: of the way in which ground is prepared bydigging, we have made sufficient mention already. (22.) Inpreparing the furrows<span id="ref_31"><a href="#note_31">[31]</a></span> for the vine it will be quite sufficient<pb n="3501" />if they are a spade in breadth; but if holes are employed forthe purpose, they should be three feet every way. The depthrequired for every kind of vine is three feet; it should, therefore, be made a point not to transplant any vine that is lessthan three feet in length, allowing then two buds to be abovethe ground. It will be necessary, too, to soften the earth byworking little furrows at the bottom of the hole, and mixingit up with manure. Where the ground is declivitous, it isrequisite that the hole should be deeper, in addition to whichit should be artificially elevated on the edge of the lower side.Holes of this nature, which are made a little longer, to receivetwo vines, are known as "alvei," or beds. The root of thevine should occupy the middle of the hole, and when firmlyfixed in the ground it should incline at the top due east; itsfirst support it ought to receive from a reed.<span id="ref_32"><a href="#note_32">[32]</a></span> The vineyardshould be bounded by a decuman<span id="ref_33"><a href="#note_33">[33]</a></span> path eighteen feet in width,sufficiently wide, in fact, to allow two carts to pass each other;others, again, should run at right angles to it, ten feet inwidth, and passing through the middle of each jugerum; orelse, if the vineyard is of very considerable extent, cardinal<span id="ref_34"><a href="#note_34">[34]</a></span>paths may be formed instead of them, of the same breadth asthe decuman path. At the end, too, of every five of the stays apath should be made to run, or, in other words, there shouldbe one continuous cross-piece to every five stays; each spacethat is thus included from one end to the other forming abed.<span id="ref_35"><a href="#note_35">[35]</a></span></p><p>Where the soil is dense and hard it must be turned up onlywith the spade, and nothing but quicksets should be plantedthere; but where, on the other hand, it is thin and loose,mallet-shoots even may be set either in hole or furrow. Wherethe ground is declivitous it is a better plan to draw furrowsacross than to turn up all the soil with the spade, so that thefalling away of the earth may be counteracted by the positionof the cross-pieces.<span id="ref_36"><a href="#note_36">[36]</a></span> It will be best, too, where the weather<pb n="3502" />is wet or the soil naturally dry, to plant the mallet-shoots inautumn, unless, indeed, there is anything in the nature of thelocality to counteract it; for while a dry, hot soil makes itnecessary to plant in autumn, in a moist, cold one it may benecessary to defer it until the end of spring even. In aparched soil, too, it would be quite in vain to plant quicksets,and it is far from advantageous to set mallet-shoots in a dryground, except just after a fall of rain. On the other hand,in moist localities, a vine in leaf even may be transplanted andthrive very well, and that, too, even as late as the summersolstice, in Spain, for example. It is of very considerable advantage that there should be no wind stirring on the day ofplanting, and, though many persons are desirous that thereshould be a south wind blowing at the time, Cato<span id="ref_37"><a href="#note_37">[37]</a></span> is of quitea different way of thinking.</p><p>In a soil of medium quality, it is best to leave an interval offive<span id="ref_38"><a href="#note_38">[38]</a></span> feet between every two vines; where it is very fertilethe distance should be five feet at least, and where it is poorand thin eight at the very most. The Umbri and the Marsileave intervals between their vines of as much as twenty feetin length, for the purpose of ploughing between them; sucha plot of ground as this they call by the name of "porculetum." In a rainy, foggy locality, the plants ought to be setwider apart, but in dry spots nearer to one another. Carefulobservation has discovered various methods of economizingspace; thus, for instance, when a vineyard is planted inshaded ground, a seed-plot is formed there as well; or, inother words, at the same time that the quickset is planted inthe place which it is finally to occupy, the mallet-shoot intended for transplanting is set between the vines, as well asbetween the rows. By adopting this method, each jugerumwill produce about sixteen thousand quicksets; and the resultis, that two years' fruit is gained thereby, a cutting plantedbeing two years later in bearing than a quickset transplanted.Quicksets, when growing in a vineyard, are cut down atthe end of a year, leaving only a single eye above ground;<pb n="3503" />some manure is then placed upon the spot, and a stay drivenin close to the plant. In the same manner it is again cutdown at the end<span id="ref_39"><a href="#note_39">[39]</a></span> of the second year, and from this it acquiresadditional strength, and receives nutriment to enable it toendure the onerous task of reproduction. If this is neglected,in its over-haste to bear it will shoot up slim and meagre,like a bulrush, and from not being subjected to such a training, will grow to nothing but wood. In fact, there is no treethat grows with greater eagerness than the vine, and if itsstrength is not carefully husbanded for the bearing of fruit, itwill be sure to grow to nothing but wood.</p><p>The best props for supporting the vine are those which wehave already mentioned,<span id="ref_40"><a href="#note_40">[40]</a></span> or else stays made of the robur andthe olive; if these cannot be procured, then props of juniper,cypress, laburnum, or elder,<span id="ref_41"><a href="#note_41">[41]</a></span> must be employed. If any otherwood is used for the purpose, the stakes should be cut at theend each year: reeds tied together in bundles make excellentcross-rails for the vine, and will last as long as five years.Sometimes the shorter stock-branches of the vines are broughttogether and tied with vine-cuttings, like so many cords: bythis method an arcade is formed, known to us by the name of"funetum."</p><p>The vine, by the end of the third year, throws out strongand vigorous stock-branches with the greatest rapidity, andthese in due time form the tree; after this, it begins to mountthe cross-piece. Some persons are in the habit of "blinding"the vine at this period, by removing the eyes with the end ofthe pruning-knife turned upwards, their object being to increase the length of the branches—a most injurious practice,however; for it is far better to let the tree become habituatedto grow of itself, and to prune away the tendrils every nowand then when they have reached the cross-rail, so long as itmay be deemed proper to add to its strength. There are somepersons who forbid the vine to be touched for a whole yearafter it has been transplanted, and who say that the pruning-knife ought never to be used before it is five years old; and<pb n="3504" />then at that period they are for cutting it down so completelyas to leave three buds only. Others, again, cut down the vinewithin a year even after it has been transplanted, but thenthey take care to let the stem increase every year by three orfour joints, bringing it on a level with the cross-piece by thefourth. These two methods, however, both of them, retard thefruit and render the tree stunted and knotty, as we see thecase in all dwarf trees. The best plan is to make the parentstem as robust and vigorous as possible, and then the woodwill be sure to be strong and hardy. It is far from safe, too,to take slips from a cicatrized stem; such a practice is erro-neous, and only the result of ignorance. All cuttings of thisnature are sure to be the offspring of acts of violence, and notin reality of the tree itself. The vine, while growing, shouldbe possessed of all its natural strength; and we find thatwhen left entirely to itself, it will throw out wood in everypart; for there is no portion of it that Nature does not actupon. When the stem has grown sufficiently strong for thepurpose, it should at once be trained to the cross-piece; if, how-ever, it is but weak, it should be cut down so as to lie belowthe hospitable shelter of the cross-piece. Indeed, it is thestrength of the stem, and not its age, that ought to decide thematter. It is not advisable<span id="ref_42"><a href="#note_42">[42]</a></span> to attempt to train a vine beforethe stem has attained the thickness of the thumb; but in theyear after it has reached the frame, one or two stock-branchesshould be preserved, according to the strength developed bythe parent tree. The same, too, must be done the succeedingyear, if the weakness of the stem demands it; and in the next,two more should be added. Still, however, there should neverbe more than four branches allowed to grow; in one word,there must be no indulgence shown, and every exuberance inthe tree must in all cases be most carefully repressed; forsuch is the nature of the vine, that it is more eager to bearthan it is to live. It should be remembered, too, that all thatis subtracted from the wood is so much added to the fruit.The vine, in fact, would much rather produce shoots and ten-drils than fruit, because<span id="ref_43"><a href="#note_43">[43]</a></span> its fruit, after all, is but a transitorypossession: hence it is that it luxuriates to its own undoing,and instead of really gaining ground, exhausts itself.<pb n="3505" /></p><p>The nature, too, of the soil will afford some very usefulsuggestions. Where it is thin and hungry, even though thevine should display considerable vigour, it should be pruneddown below the cross-piece and kept there, so that all theshoots may be put forth below it. The interval, however, between the top of the vine and the cross-piece ought to be butvery small; so much so, indeed, as to leave it hopes, as itwere, of reaching it, which, however, it must never be sufferedto do; for it should never be allowed to recline thereon andspread and run on at its ease. This mode of culture ought, infact, to be so nicely managed, that the vine should show aninclination rather to grow in body than to run to wood.</p><p>The main branch should have two or three buds left belowthe cross-piece that give promise of bearing wood, and itshould be carefully trained along the rail, and drawn closeto it in such a manner as to be supported by it, and notmerely hang loosely from it. When this is done, it shouldbe tightly fastened also with a binding three buds off, amethod which will greatly contribute to check the too abundant growth of the wood, while stouter shoots will be thrownout below the ligature: it is absolutely forbidden, however, to tie the extremity of the main branch. When allthis is done, Nature operates in the following way—the partsthat are allowed to fall downward, or those which are held fastby the ligature, give out fruit, those at the bend of the branchmore particularly. On the other hand, the portion that liesbelow the ligature throws out wood; by reason, I suppose, ofthe interception of the vital spirit and the marrow or pith, previously mentioned:<span id="ref_44"><a href="#note_44">[44]</a></span> the wood, too, that is grown under thesecircumstances will bear fruit in the following year. In thisway there are two kinds of stock branches: the first of which,issuing from the solid stock, gives promise of wood only forthis year, and is known as the leaf stock-branch;<span id="ref_45"><a href="#note_45">[45]</a></span> while thatwhich grows beyond the mark made by the ligature is a fruitstock-branch.<span id="ref_46"><a href="#note_46">[46]</a></span> There are other kinds, again, that shoot fromthe stock-branches when they are a year old, and these are inall cases fruit stock-branches. There is left, also, beneath thecross-piece a shoot that is known as the reserve<span id="ref_47"><a href="#note_47">[47]</a></span> shoot, beingalways a young stock-branch, with not more than three budsupon it. This is intended to give out wood the next year, in<pb n="3506" />case the vine by over-luxuriance should happen to exhaustitself. Close to it there is another bud left, no bigger than awart; this is known as the "furunculus,"<span id="ref_48"><a href="#note_48">[48]</a></span> and is kept inreadiness in case the reserve shoot should fail.</p><p>The vine, if enticed to bear fruit before the seventh yearfrom its being planted as a slip, will pine<span id="ref_49"><a href="#note_49">[49]</a></span> away, become asslim as a bulrush, and die. It is thought equally undesirable,too, to let an old stock-branch range far and wide, and extendas far as the fourth stay from the stem; to such a branch thename of dragon<span id="ref_50"><a href="#note_50">[50]</a></span>-branch is given by some, and of juniculus byothers; if these are allowed to spread, they will run to woodonly, and make male vines, as they are called. When a vinehas become quite hard, it is an extremely bad plan to use itfor reproduction by layers. When the vine is five years oldthe stock-branches are twisted, but each is allowed to throwout some new wood; and so from one to another, care beingtaken to prune away the old wood. It is always the bestplan, however, to leave a reserve shoot; but this should alwaysbe very near the main stem of the vine, not at a greater distance, in fact, than that already mentioned.<span id="ref_51"><a href="#note_51">[51]</a></span> If, too, thestock branches should throw out too luxuriantly, they mustbe twisted, the object being that the vine may put forth nomore than four secondary branches, or even two only, if ithappens to be a single cross-railed vine.</p><p>If the vine is to be trained to grow without any stay at all,still it will stand in need, at first, of some support or other,until it has learnt to support itself: in all other respects themode of proceeding will be the same at first. When pruning,it will be necessary that the thumb-branches<span id="ref_52"><a href="#note_52">[52]</a></span> should be arranged in equal numbers on either side, in order that the fruitmay not overload one side of the tree; and we may here remarkby the way, that the fruit by its weight is apt to bear downthe tree and counteract any tendency to increase in height.The vine, unsupported, when more than three feet in height,begins to bend, but the others do not, until they are five feet<pb n="3507" />high at the least; care should be taken, however, never to letthem exceed the height of a man of moderate stature. Growersare in the habit of surrounding the vines that creep along theground with a low fence<span id="ref_53"><a href="#note_53">[53]</a></span> for them to lean upon; and roundthis fence they dig a trench by way of precaution, for fear lestthe branches in their range should meet one another and socome into collision. The greater part of the world, in fact,gather grapes at their vintage, grown in this fashion, and lyingupon the ground—at all events, it is so in Africa, Egypt, andSyria; throughout the whole of Asia, too, and in many partsof Europe as well, this method prevails. In such cases thevine ought to be kept down close to the ground, and the rootshould be nurtured at the same time and in just the same wayas in the case of the vine that grows on the cross-piece. Care,too, should be taken to leave only the young thumb-shoots,together with three buds, where it is a prolific soil, two whereit is poor and thin: it is better, too, that the shoots should benumerous than individually long. The influences of soil, ofwhich we have made mention already, will make themselvesfelt all the more powerfully the nearer the grapes grow to theground.</p><p>It is a very advantageous plan to separate<span id="ref_54"><a href="#note_54">[54]</a></span> the variousspecies of vines and to set them in different compartments—for the mixture of different varieties is apt to deteriorate theflavour not only of the must, but the wine even as well. If,again, for some reason or other, the different kinds must beintermingled, it will be requisite to keep all those togetherwhich ripen at exactly the same period. The more fertile andthe more level the soil, the higher the cross-pieces must heplaced.<span id="ref_55"><a href="#note_55">[55]</a></span> High cross-pieces, too, are best suited to localitiesthat are subject to heavy dews and fogs, but not to thosethat are exposed to high winds; on the other hand, where thesoil is thin, parched, and arid, or exposed to the wind, thecross-pieces should be set lower. The cross-piece should befastened to the stay with cords tied as tight as possible, whilethe bindings used for tying the vine should be thin. As tothe various species of vines, and the soils and climates requi-<pb n="3508" />site for the growth of each, we have already treated<span id="ref_56"><a href="#note_56">[56]</a></span> of them,when enumerating the several varieties of the vine and thewines which they produce.</p><p>With reference to other points connected with the cultureof the vine, there are very considerable doubts. Many persons recommend that the vineyard should be turned up withthe spade after every dew that falls in the summer. Others,again, forbid this practice when the vine is in bud; for theclothes, they say, of the people coming and going to and froare apt to catch the buds, and either knock or rub them off;it is for this reason, too, that they are so careful to keep allanimals away from the vines, those with long wool in particular, as it is very apt to pull off the buds. Raking, too,they say, is very injurious to the vine while the grape is forming; and it will be quite sufficient, they assure us, if theground is turned up three times in the year, after the vernalequinox—first, at the rising of the Vergiliæ,<span id="ref_57"><a href="#note_57">[57]</a></span> the second atthe rising of the Dog-star, and the third time just as the grapeis turning black. Some persons make it a rule that an oldvineyard shall have one turning up between the time of vintage and the winter solstice, though others, again, are of opinion that it is quite sufficient to bare the roots and manurethem. They turn up the ground again after the ides of April,<span id="ref_58"><a href="#note_58">[58]</a></span>but before the time for germination, or, in other words, thesixth of the ides of May;<span id="ref_59"><a href="#note_59">[59]</a></span> then again before the tree beginsto blossom, after it has shed its blossom, and, last of all,when the grape is just on the turn. The most skilful growerssay that if the ground is dug up oftener than necessary, thegrapes will become so remarkably thin-skinned as to burst.When the ground is turned up, care should be taken to do itbefore the hot hours of the day; a clayey soil, too, shouldnever be ploughed or dug. The dust that is raised in diggingis beneficial<span id="ref_60"><a href="#note_60">[60]</a></span> to the vine, it is said, by protecting it from theheat of the sun and the injurious effects of fogs.</p><p>The spring clearing ought to be done, it is universally admitted, within ten days after the ides of May,<span id="ref_61"><a href="#note_61">[61]</a></span> and before the<pb n="3509" />blossoming begins; in addition to which, it should always bedone below the cross-piece. As to the second clearing, opinions differ very considerably. Some think it ought to be donewhen the blossoming is over, others, again, when the grapesare nearly at maturity. This point, however, may be decidedby following the advice of Cato on the subject; for we mustnow pass on to a description of the proper' mode of pruningthe vine.</p><p>Immediately after<span id="ref_62"><a href="#note_62">[62]</a></span> the vintage, and while the weather is stillwarm, the work of pruning<span id="ref_63"><a href="#note_63">[63]</a></span> begins; this, however, ought neverto be done, for certain physical reasons,<span id="ref_64"><a href="#note_64">[64]</a></span> before the rising of theEagle, as we shall have occasion to explain in the followingBook. Nor should it be done either when the west windsbegin to prevail, for even then there is great doubt whether afault may not be committed by being in too great haste tocommence the work. If any return of wintry weather shouldchance to nip the vines, while still labouring under the woundsrecently inflicted on them in pruning, there is little doubtthat their buds will become quite benumbed with cold, thewounds will open again, and the eyes, moistened by the juicesthat distil from the tree, will become frost-bitten by the rigourof the weather. For who is there,<span id="ref_65"><a href="#note_65">[65]</a></span> in fact, that does not knowthat the buds are rendered brittle by frost? All this, however, depends upon accurate calculations in the management oflarge grounds, and the blame of precipitation cannot with anyjustice be laid upon Nature. The earlier the vine is pruned,in suitable weather, the greater is the quantity of wood, whilethe later the pruning, the more abundant is the fruit. Henceit is that it is most advisable to prune the poor meagre vinesfirst, and to defer pruning the more thriving ones to the verylast. In pruning, due care should always be taken to cut ina slanting direction, in order<span id="ref_66"><a href="#note_66">[66]</a></span> that the rain may run off withall the greater facility. The wounds, too, should look down-<pb n="3510" />wards towards the ground, and should be made as lightly aspossible, the edge of the knife being well-sharpened for thepurpose, so as to make a clean cut each time. Care should betaken, too, to cut always between two buds, and that the eyesare not injured in the operation. It is generally thought thatwherever the vine is black, all those parts may be cut off, thehealthy parts not being touched; as no useful shoots can beput forth by wood that is bad in itself. If a meagre vine hasnot good stock-shoots, the best plan is to cut it down to theground, and then to train new ones. In clearing away theleaves, too, those leaves should not be removed which accompanythe clusters, for by so doing the grapes are made to fall off, except where the vine happens to be young. Those leaves areregarded as useless which grow on the sides of the trunk andnot from an eye; and so, too, are the bunches which shootfrom the hard, strong wood, and are only to be removed by theaid of the knife.</p><p>Some persons are of opinion that it is a better plan to fixthe stay midway between two vines; and, indeed, by the adoption of this method the roots are cleared with greater facility.It is best, however, where the vine needs but a single cross-rail, due care being taken that the rail is a strong one, and thelocality not exposed to high winds. In the case of thosevines which require trellissed cross-rails, the stay should beplaced as near as possible to the burden it has to support; inorder, however, that there may be no impediment thrown inthe way of clearing the roots, it may be placed at the distanceof one cubit from the stock, but not more. It is generallyrecommended to clear the roots before the pruning<span id="ref_67"><a href="#note_67">[67]</a></span> is commenced.</p><p>Cato<span id="ref_68"><a href="#note_68">[68]</a></span> gives the following general precepts in relation to theculture of the vine:—" Let the vine grow as high as possible,and fasten it firmly, but not too tight. You should treat it inthe following manner. Clean the roots of the vine at seedtime, and after pruning it dig about it, and then begin tolabour at the ground, by tracing with the plough continuousfurrows every way. Plant the young vines in layers as earlyas possible, and then break up the ground about them. If the<pb n="3511" />vine is old, take care and prune it as little as possible. Inpreference, bend the vine into the ground for layers, if necessary, and cut it at the end of two years. The proper time forcutting the young vine, is when it has gained sufficientstrength. If the vineyard is bald of vines, then draw furrowsbetween them, and plant quicksets there: but let no shadowbe thrown on the furrows, and take care and dig them often.If the vineyard is old, sow ocinum<span id="ref_69"><a href="#note_69">[69]</a></span> there, in case the trees aremeagre: but take care and sow there nothing that bears seed.Put manure, chaff, and grape-husks about the roots, or, indeed, anything of a similar nature that will give the tree additional strength. As soon as the vine begins to throw outleaves, set about clearing them. Fasten the young trees inmore places than one, so that the stem may not break. Assoon as it begins to run along the stay, fasten down the youngbranches lightly, and extend them, in order that they may gainthe right position. When the grape begins to be mottled,then tie down the vine. The first season for grafting the vineis the spring, the other when the grape is in blossom; the lastperiod is the best. If it is your wish to transplant an oldvine, you will only be able to do so in case it is no thicker thanthe arm: first, however, you must prune it, taking care not tohave more than two buds upon the stem. Then dig it well upby the roots, being careful to trace them, and using everypossible precaution not to injure them. Place it in the hole orfurrow exactly in the position in which it has stood before,then cover it with earth, which should be well trodden down.You must then prop it up, fasten it, and turn it in the samedirection as before; after which, dig about it repeatedly." Theocinum that Cato here recommends to be sown in the vineyards, is a fodder known by that name by the ancients; itthrives in the shade remarkably well, and received its name<span id="ref_70"><a href="#note_70">[70]</a></span>from the rapidity with which it grows.</p><p>(23.) We come now to speak of the method of growingvines upon trees,<span id="ref_71"><a href="#note_71">[71]</a></span> a mode that has been condemned<span id="ref_72"><a href="#note_72">[72]</a></span> in thestrongest terms by the Saserna's, both father and son, and up-<pb n="3512" />held by Scrofa, these being our most ancient writers on agri-culture next to Cato, and men of remarkable skill. Indeed,Scrofa himself will not admit that it is beneficial anywhereexcept in Italy. The experience of ages, however, hats sufficiently proved that the wines of the highest quality are onlygrown upon vines attached to trees, and that even then thechoicest wines are produced by the upper part of the tree, theproduce of the lower part being more abundant; such being thebeneficial results of elevating the vine. It is with a view tothis that the trees employed for this purpose are selected. Inthe first rank of all stands the elm,<span id="ref_73"><a href="#note_73">[73]</a></span> with the exception of theAtinian variety, which is covered with too many leaves; andnext comes the black poplar, which is valued for a similarreason, being not so densely covered with leaves. Most people,too, by no means hold the ash and the fig in disesteem, asalso the olive, if it is not overshadowed with branches. Wehave treated at sufficient length already of the planting andculture of these several trees.</p><p>They must not be touched with the knife before the end ofthree years; and then the branches are preserved, on each sidein its turn, the pruning being done in alternate years. In thesixth year the vine is united to the tree. In Italy beyond thePadus, in addition to the trees already mentioned, they plantfor their vines the cornel, the opulus, the linden, the maple,the ash, the yoke-elm, and the quercus; while in Venetia theygrow willows for the purpose, on account of the humidity<span id="ref_74"><a href="#note_74">[74]</a></span> ofthe soil. The top of the elm is lopped away, and the branchesof the middle are regularly arranged in stages; no tree ingeneral being allowed to exceed twenty feet in height. Thestories begin to spread out in the tree at eight feet from theground, in the hilly districts and upon dry soils, and at twelvein champaign and moist localities. The hand<span id="ref_75"><a href="#note_75">[75]</a></span> of the trunkought to have a southern aspect, and the branches that projectfrom them should be stiff and rigid like so many fingers; atthe same time due care should be taken to lop off the thinbeardlike twigs, in order to check the growth of all shade.The interval best suited for the trees, if it is the grower's intention to keep the soil turned up with the plough, is forty feetback and front, and twenty at the side; if it is not to be turned<pb n="3513" />up, then twenty feet<span id="ref_76"><a href="#note_76">[76]</a></span> every way will do. A single tree isoften made to support as many as ten vines, and the grower isgreatly censured who attaches less than three. It is worsethan useless to attach the vine before the tree has gained itsfull strength, as in such case its rapidity of growth wouldonly tend to kill the tree. It is necessary to plant the vinein a trench three feet in depth, leaving an interval of onefoot between it and the tree. In this case there is no necessity for using mallet shoots, or for going to any expense inspading or digging; for this method of training on trees hasthis advantage in particular, that it is beneficial even to thevine that corn should be sown in the same soil; in addition towhich, from its height, it is quite able to protect itself, anddoes not call for the necessity, as in the case of an ordinaryvineyard, of enclosing it with walls and hedges or ditches,made at a considerable expense, to protect it from injury byanimals.</p><p>In the method of training upon trees, reproduction fromquicksets or from layers is the only mode employed of allthose that have been previously described; the growing bylayers being effected two different ways, as already mentioned.The plan, however, of growing from layers in baskets set uponthe stages<span id="ref_77"><a href="#note_77">[77]</a></span> of the tree is the most approved one, as it ensuresan efficient protection from the ravages of cattle; while, according to another method, a vine or else a stock-branch is bentinto the ground near the tree it has previously occupied, or elsethe nearest one that may be at liberty. It is recommendedthat all parts of the parent tree that appear above groundshould then be scraped, so that it may not throw out wood;while at the same time there are never less than four buds onthe part that is put into the ground for the purpose of takingroot; there are also two buds left above ground at the head.The vine intended for training on a tree is planted in a furrowfour feet long, three broad, and two and a half in depth. Atthe end of a year the layer is cut to the pith, to enable it tostrengthen gradually at the root; after which, the end of thebranch is pruned down to within two buds from the ground.At the end of two years the layer is completely separatedfrom the stock, and buried deeper in the ground, that it may<pb n="3514" />not shoot at the place where it has been cut. As to the quicksets, they ought to be removed directly after the vintage.</p><p>In more recent times, a plan has been discovered of plantinga dragon branch near the tree—that being the name given toan old stock-branch that has become hard and tough in thecourse of years. For this purpose, it is cut as long as possible, and the bark is taken off from three-fourths of its length,that being the portion which is to be buried in the ground;hence it is, too, that it is called a "barked"<span id="ref_78"><a href="#note_78">[78]</a></span> plant. It isthen laid at full length in the furrow, the remaining part protruding from the ground and reclining against the tree. Thismethod is the most speedy one that can be adopted for growingthe vine. If the vine is meagre or the soil impoverished, it isusual to keep it cut down as near to the ground as possible,until such time as the root is strengthened. Care, too, shouldbe taken not to plant it covered with dew,<span id="ref_79"><a href="#note_79">[79]</a></span> nor yet while thewind is blowing from the north. The vine itself ought tolook towards the north-east, but the young stock-shoots shouldhave a southern aspect.</p><p>There should not be too great haste<span id="ref_80"><a href="#note_80">[80]</a></span> in pruning a youngvine, but a beginning should be made by giving the wood andfoliage a circular form, care being taken not to prune it untilit has become quite strong; it should be remembered, too,that the vine, when trained upon a tree, is generally a yearlater in bearing fruit than when grown on the cross-piece.There are some persons, again, who altogether forbid that avine should be pruned until such time as it equals the tree inheight. At the first pruning it may be cut to within six feetfrom the ground, below which a shoot must be left, and encouraged to run out by bending the young wood. Upon thisshoot, when pruned, there should not be more than three budsleft. The branches that take their rise from these buds shouldbe trained in the following year upon the lowermost stages ofthe tree, and so in each successive year taught to climb to thehigher ones. Care, too, should always be taken to leave onehard, woody branch at each stage, as well as one breedingshoot, at liberty to mount as high as it pleases. In additionto these precautions, in all pruning, those shoots should be cutoff which have borne fruit the last year, and after the ten-<pb n="3515" />drils<span id="ref_81"><a href="#note_81">[81]</a></span> have been cut away on every side fresh branches shouldbe trained to run along the stages. In Italy the pruning is somanaged that the shoots and tendrils of the vines are arrangedso as to cover the branches of the tree, while the shoots of thevine in their turn are surrounded with clusters of grapes. InGallia, on the other hand, the vine is trained to pass from treeto tree. On the Æmilian Way, again, the vine is seen embracing the trunks of the Atinian elms that line the road,while at the same time it carefully avoids their foliage.<span id="ref_82"><a href="#note_82">[82]</a></span></p><p>It is a mark of ignorance in some persons to suspend thevine with a cord beneath the branches of the tree, to the greatrisk of stifling it; for it ought to be merely kept up with awithe of osier, and not tightly laced. Indeed, in those placeswhere the willow abounds, the withes that it affords are preferred, on account of their superior suppleness, while the Sicilians employ for the purpose a grass, which they call "ampelodesmos:"<span id="ref_83"><a href="#note_83">[83]</a></span> throughout the whole of Greece, rushes, cyperus,and sedge<span id="ref_84"><a href="#note_84">[84]</a></span> are similarly employed. When at any time thevine has been liberated from its bonds, it should be allowed torange uncontrolled for some days, and to spread abroad atpleasure, as well as to recline upon the ground which it hasbeen looking down upon the whole year through. For in thesame manner that beasts of burden when released from theyoke, and dogs when they have returned from the chase, loveto roll themselves on the ground, just so does the vine delightto stretch its loins. The tree itself, too, seems to rejoice, and,thus relieved from the continuous weight which has burdenedit, to have all the appearance of now enjoying a free respiration. Indeed, there is no object in all the economy of Naturethat does not desire certain alternations for the enjoyment ofrest, witness the succession of night and day, for instance. Itis for this reason that it is forbidden to prune the vine directlythe vintage is over, and while it is still exhausted by theprocess of reproduction.</p><p>Directly the vine has been pruned, it ought to be fastenedagain to the tree, but in another place; for there is no doubtthat it feels very acutely the indentations that are made in it<pb n="3516" />by the holdfasts. In the Gallic method of cultivation theytrain out two branches at either side, if the trees are forty feetapart, and four if only twenty; where they meet, these branchesare fastened together and made to grow in unison; if, too, theyare anywhere deficient in number or strength, care is takento fortify them by the aid of small rods. In a case, however,where the branches are not sufficiently long to meet, they areartificially prolonged by means of a hook, and so united to thetree that desires their company. The branches thus trained tounite they used to prime at the end of the second year. Butwhere the vine is aged, it is a better plan to give them a longertime to reach the adjoining tree, in case they should not havegained the requisive thickness; besides which, it is alwaysgood to encourage the growth of the hard wood in the dragonbranches.</p><p>There is yet another method,<span id="ref_85"><a href="#note_85">[85]</a></span> which occupies a middleplace between this mode of propagation and that by layers.It consists of laying the entire vine in the earth, and thensplitting the stock asunder by means of wedges; the fibrousportions are then trained out in as many furrows, care beingtaken to support each of the slender plants by fastening it toa stake, and not to cut away the branches that shoot from thesides. The growers of Novara, not content with the multitude of shoots that run from tree to tree, nor yet with anabundance of branches, encourage the stock-branches to entwine around forks planted in the ground for the purpose; amethod, however, which, in addition to the internal defectsarising from the soil, imparts a harshness to the wine.</p><p>There is another fault, too, that is committed by the peopleof Varracina,<span id="ref_86"><a href="#note_86">[86]</a></span> near Rome-they only prune their vines everyother year; not, indeed, because it is advantageous to the tree,but from a fear lest, from the low prices fetched by their wines,the expense might exceed the profits. At Carseoli they adopta middle course, by pruning away only the rotten parts ofthe vine, as well as those which are beginning to wither, andleaving the rest to bear fruit, after thus clearing away allsuperfluous incumbrances. The only nutriment they giveit is this exemption from frequent pruning; but unless thesoil should happen to be a very rich one, the vine, under such<pb n="3517" />a method of cultivation, will very soon degenerate to a wildstate.</p><p>The vine that is thus trained requires the ground to beploughed very deep, though such is not the case for the sowingthere of grain. It is not customary to cut away the leavesin this case, which, of course, is so much labour spared.The trees themselves require pruning at the same periodas the vine, and are thinned by clearing away all uselessbranches, and such parts as would only absorb the nutriment.We have already<span id="ref_87"><a href="#note_87">[87]</a></span> stated that the parts that are lopped shouldnever look north or south: and it will be better still, if theyhave not a western aspect. The wounds thus made are verysusceptible for a considerable time, and heal with the greatestdifficulty, if exposed to excesses of cold or heat. The vinewhen trained on a tree enjoys advantages that are not possessed by the others; for the latter have certain fixed aspects,.while in the former, it is easy to cover up the wounds madein pruning, or to turn them whichever way you please. Whentrees are pruned at the top, cup-like cavities should be formed<span id="ref_88"><a href="#note_88">[88]</a></span>there, to prevent the water from lodging.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Armamentis."
