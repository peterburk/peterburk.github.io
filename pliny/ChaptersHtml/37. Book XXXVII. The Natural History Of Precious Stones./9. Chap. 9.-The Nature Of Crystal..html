<div2 type="chapter" n="9" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 9.—THE NATURE OF CRYSTAL.</head><p>It is a diametrically opposite cause to this that producescrystal,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> a substance which assumes a concrete form from excessivecongelation.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> At all events, crystal is only to be foundin places where the winter snow freezes with the greatest intensity;and it is from the certainty that it is a kind of ice,that it has received the name<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> which it bears in Greek. TheEast, too, sends us crystal, there being none preferred to the produceof India. It is to be found, also, in Asia, that of the vicinityof Alabanda,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> Orthosia,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> and the neighbouring mountains,being held in a very low degree of esteem. In Cyprus, also,<pb n="6395" />there is crystal, but that found upon the Alpine heights inEurope is, in general, more highly valued. According toJuba, there is crystal in a certain island of the Red Sea, oppositethe coast of Arabia, called "Necron;"<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> as, also, in anotherneighbouring island<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> which produces the precious stoneknown as the "topazus;" where a block of crystal was extracted,he says, by Pythagoras, the præfect of King Ptolemaæus,no less than a cubit in length.</p><p>Cornelius Bocchus informs us that in Lusitania, there havebeen blocks of crystal found, of extraordinary weight, in sinkingshafts in the Ammiensian<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> mountains there, to a water-levelfor the supply of wells. It is a marvellous fact, stated by Xenocratesof Ephesus, that in Asia and in the Isle of Cyprus,crystal is turned up by the plough; it having been the generalbelief that it is never to be found in terreous soils, and onlyin rocky localities. That is much more probable which thesame Xenocrates tells us, when he says that the mountainstreams often bring down with them fragments of crystal.Sudines says, that crystal is only to be found in localities thatface the south, a thing that is known to be really the fact:indeed, it is never found in humid spots, however cold theclimate may be, even though the rivers there freeze to the verybottom. Rain-water and pure snow are absolutely necessaryfor its formation,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> and hence it is, that it is unable to endureheat, being solely employed for holding liquids that are takencold. From the circumstance of its being hexagonal<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> andhexahedral, it is not easy to penetrate this substance; and themore so, as the pyramidal terminations do not always havethe same appearance. The polish on its faces is so exquisite,that no art can possibly equal it.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Colourless crystals, quartz, or rock crystal; called "white stone" injewellery.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxxvi. c. 45.
