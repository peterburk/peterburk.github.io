<div2 type="chapter" n="7" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 7. (7.)—THE ISLANDS IN THE VICINITY OF AFRICA.</head><p>These seas contain not so very many islands. The mostfamous among them is Meninx<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>, twenty-five miles in lengthand twenty-two in breadth: by Eratosthenes it is calledLotophagitis. This island has two towns, Meninx on theside which faces Africa, and Troas on the other; it is situateoff the promontory which lies on the right-hand side of theLesser Syrtis, at a distance of a mile and a half. One hundredmiles from this island, and opposite the promontorythat lies on the left, is the free island of Cercina<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>, with a<pb n="1403" />city of the same name. It is twenty-five miles long, andhalf that breadth at the place where it is the widest, butnot more than five miles across at the extremity: the diminutiveisland of Cercinitis<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>, which looks towards Carthage,is united to it by a bridge. At a distance of nearlyfifty miles from these is the island of Lopadusa<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, six milesin length; and beyond it Gaulos and Galata, the soil of whichkills the scorpion, that noxious reptile of Africa. It isalso said that the scorpion will not live at Clypea; oppositeto which place lies the island of Cosyra<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>, with a town of thesame name. Opposite to the Gulf of Carthage are the twoislands known as the Ægimuri<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>; the Altars<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>, which arerather rocks than islands, lie more between Sicily and Sardinia.There are some authors who state that these rockswere once inhabited, but that they have gradually subsidedin the sea.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called Zerbi and Jerba, derived from the name of Girba, which even in the time of Aurelius Victor, had supplanted that of Meninx. It is situate in the Gulf of Cabes. According to Solinus, C. Marius lay in concealment here for some time. It was famous for its purple. See B. ix. c. 60.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called Kerkéni, Karkenah, or Ramlah.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Gherba. It was reckoned as a mere appendage to Cercina, to which it was joined by a mole, and which is found often mentioned in history.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Still called Lampedusa, off the coast of Tunis. This island, with Gaulos and Galata, has been already mentioned among the islands off Sicily; see B. iii. c. 14.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Pantellaria. See B. iii. c. 14.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A lofty island surrounded by dangerous cliffs, now called Zowamour or Zembra.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In the former editions the word "Aræ" is taken to refer to the Ægimuri, as meaning the same islands. Sillig is however of opinion that totally distinct groups are meant, and punctuates accordingly. The "Aræ" were probably mere rocks lying out at sea, which received their name from their fancied resemblance to altars. They are mentioned by Virgil in the Æneid, B. i. l. 113, upon which lines Servius says, that they were so called because there the Romans and the people of Africa on one occasion made a treaty.</p></body>
