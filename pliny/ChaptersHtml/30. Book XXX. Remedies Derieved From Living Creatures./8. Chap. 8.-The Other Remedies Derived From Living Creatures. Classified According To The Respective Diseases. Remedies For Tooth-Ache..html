<div2 type="chapter" n="8" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 8.—THE OTHER REMEDIES DERIVED FROM LIVING CREATURES.CLASSIFIED ACCORDING TO THE RESPECTIVE DISEASES. REMEDIESFOR TOOTH-ACHE.</head><p>But to proceed with the remedies for tooth-ache—the magicians tell us, that it may be cured by using the ashes of thehead of a dog that has died in a state of madness. The head,however, must be burnt without the flesh, and the ashesinjected with oil of cyprus<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> into the ear on the side affected.For the same purpose also, the left eye-tooth of a dog is used.the gum of the affected tooth being lanced with it; one of thevertebræ also of a dragon or of an enhydris, which is a malewhite serpent.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> The eye-tooth, too, of this last, is used forscarifying the gums; and when the pain affects the teeth of theupper jaw, they attach to the patient two of the upper teeth ofthe serpent, and, similarly, two of the lower ones for tooth-achein the lower jaw. Persons who go in pursuit of the crocodile,anoint themselves with the fat of this animal. The gums arealso scarified with the frontal bones of a lizard, taken fromit at full moon, and not allowed to touch the ground: or elsethe mouth is rinsed with a decoction of dogs' teeth in wine,boiled down to one half.</p><p>Ashes of dogs' teeth, mixed with honey, are useful fordifficult dentition in children, and a dentifrice is similarlyprepared from them. Hollow teeth are plugged with ashes ofburnt mouse-dung, or with a lizard's liver, dried. To eat asnake's heart, or to wear it, attached to the body, is consideredhighly efficacious. There are some among the magicians, whorecommend a mouse to be eaten twice a month, as a preventiveof tooth-ache. Earth-worms, boiled in oil and injected intothe ear on the side affected, afford considerable relief: ashes,too, of burnt earth-worms, introduced into carious teeth, makethem come out easily; and, used as a friction, they allay painsin such of the teeth as are sound: the proper way of burningthem is in an earthen potsherd. They are useful, too, boiledwith root of the mulberry-tree in squill vinegar, and employedas a collutory for the teeth. The small worm that is foundin the plant known as Venus'<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> bath, is remarkably useful,<pb n="5431" />introduced<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> into a hollow tooth; and as to the cabbage caterpillar, it will make hollow teeth come out, by the mere contactonly. The bugs<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> that are found upon mallows, are injectedinto the ears, beaten up with oil of roses.</p><p>The small grits of sand that are found in the horns of snails,introduced into hollow teeth, remove the pain instantaneously.Ashes of empty snail-shells, mixed with myrrh,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> are good forthe gums; the ashes also of a serpent, burnt with salt in anearthen pot, and injected, with oil of roses, into the ear oppositeto the side affected; or else the slough of a snake, warmed withoil and torch-pine resin,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> and injected into either ear. Somepersons add frankincense and oil of roses, a preparation which,of itself, introduced into hollow teeth, makes them come outwithout pain. It is all a fiction, in my opinion, to say thatwhite snakes cast this slough about the rising of the Dog-star;for such a thing has never been seen in Italy, and it is stillmore improbable that sloughing should take place at so latea period in the warmer climates. We find it stated also, that thisslough, even when it has been kept for some time, mixed withwax, will extract a tooth very expeditiously, if applied thereto: a snake's tooth, also, attached to the body as an amulet,allays tooth-ache. Some persons think that it is a good remedyto catch a spider with the left hand, to beat it up with oil ofroses, and then to inject it into the ear on the side affected.</p><p>The small bones of poultry, preserved in a hole in a wall,the medullary channel being left intact, will immediately curetooth-ache, they say, if the tooth is touched or the gumscarified therewith, care being taken to throw away the bonethe moment the operation is performed. A similar result isobtained by using raven's dung, wrapped in wool and attachedto the body, or else sparrow's dung, warmed with oil and injected into the ear on the side affected. This last remedy,however, is productive of an intolerable itching, for whichreason it is considered a better plan to rub the part with theashes of young sparrows burnt upon twigs, mixed with vinegarfor the purpose.<pb n="5432" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xii. c. 51.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is doubtful what is meant by this male white "water-serpent."In B. xxxii. c. 26, he appears to include it among the fishes.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See 13. xxv. c. 108.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is a singular thing that we still hear of the maggots found in filbertsbeing used for the same purpose.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxix. c. 17.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Marcus Empiricus says, honey.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xvi. c. 19.</p></body>
