I should really have felt ashamed tomention this, had not the incident been stated in writing inthe works of M¾cenas, Fabianus, Flavius Alfius, and manyothers. At whatever hour of the day he might happen to becalled by the boy, and although hidden and out of sight at thebottom of the water, he would instantly fly to the surface,and after feeding from his hand, would present his back forhim to mount, taking care to conceal the spiny projection ofhis fins<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> in their sheath, as it were; and so, sportively takinghim up on his back, he would carry him over a wide expanse<pb n="2373" />of sea to the school at Puteoli, and in a similar manner bringhim back again. This happened for several years, until atlast the boy happened to fall ill of some malady, and died.The dolphin, however, still came to the spot as usual, with asorrowful air and manifesting every sign of deep affliction,until at last, a thing of which no one felt the slightest doubt,he died purely of sorrow and regret.</p><p>Within these few years also,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> another at Hippo Diarrhytus,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> on the coast of Africa, in a similar manner used toreceive his food from the hands of various persons, presenthimself for their caresses, sport about among the swimmers,and carry them on his back. On being rubbed with unguentsby Flavianus, the then proconsul of Africa, he was lulled tosleep, as it appeared, by the sensation of an odour so new to him,and floated about just as though he had been dead. For somemonths after this, he carefully avoided all intercourse withman, just as though he had received some affront or other; butat the end of that time he returned, and afforded just the samewonderful scenes as before. At last, the vexations that werecaused them by having to entertain so many influential menwho came to see this sight, compelled the people of Hippo toput the animal to death.</p><p>Before this, there was a similar story told of a child at thecity of Iasus,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> for whom a dolphin was long observed to haveconceived a most ardent affection, until at last, as the animalwas eagerly following him as he was making for the shore,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>it was carried by the tide on the sands, and there expired.Alexander the Great appointed this boy<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> high priest of Neptune at Babylon, interpreting this extraordinary attachmentas a convincing proof of the favour of that divinity.</p><p>Hegesidemus has also informed us, that in the same city<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> of<pb n="2374" />lasus there was another boy also, Hermias by name, who in asimilar manner used to traverse the sea on a dolphin's back,but that on one occasion a tempest suddenly arising, he losthis life, and was brought back dead; upon which, the dolphin,who thus admitted that he had been the cause of his death,would not return to the sea, but lay down upon the dry land,and there expired.</p><p>Theophrastus<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> informs us, that the very same thing happened at Naupactus also; nor, in fact, is there any limit tosimilar instances. The Amphilochians<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> and the Tarentines<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>have similar stories also about children and dolphins; and allthese give an air of credibility to the one that is told ofArion,<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> the famous performer on the lyre. The marinersbeing on the point of throwing him into the sea, for the purpose of taking possession of the money he had earned, he prevailed upon them to allow him one more song, accompaniedwith the music of his lyre. The melody attracted numbers ofdolphins around the ship, and, upon throwing himself into thesea, he was taken up by one of them, and borne in safety tothe shore of the Promontory of T¾narum.<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Symphoni¾ cantu." Hardouin is of opinion that this means themusic of the "symphonia," that being some kind of musical instrument.But, as Ajasson remarks, the meaning is much more likely to be, "singingin concert," where there are several performers, and each takes his ownpart in the symphony. It might, however, possibly mean singing and music combined, similar to the performance of Arion, mentioned at the endof the Chapter.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The organ was so called by the ancients, from the resemblance borneby its pipes to "hydraula," or water-pipes, and from the fact of thebellows being acted on by the pressure of water. According to an authorquoted by Athcnaus, B. iv. c. 75, the first organist was Ctesibius of Alexandria, who lived about B. C. <date value="-200" authname="-200">200</date>. It is not improbable that Pliny refersto this invention in B. vii. c. 38. The pipes of the organ of Ctesibius werepartly of bronze and partly of reed, and Tertullian describes it as a verycomplicated instrument.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">®lian, Hist. Anim. B. vi. c. 15, tells this story as well, and AulusGellius, B. vii. c. 8, relates it from the fifth Book of the ®gyptiaca of Apion,who stated that he himself had witnessed the fact.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Lucrine Lake originally communicated with the sea, but was afterwards separated from the Bay of Cum¾ by a dyke eight stadia in length.In the time of Augustus, however, Agrippa opened a communication betweenthe Lake and the Bay, for the purpose of forming the Julian harbour. Ifthe circumstance here mentioned by Pliny happened before this period,"invectus" must mean "carried by human agency;" but if after, it is possible that the fish may have been carried into the lake by the tide. Foran account of the lake, see B. iii. c. 9.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. iii. c. 9.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Pinnarum aculeas." See the remarks of Cuvier on this passage,and his conclusion as to the fish meant, in his Note in p. 369.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Oppian, in his Halieutica, B. v. 1. 453, mentions this story also, andof course Solinus does.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. v. c. 3.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The island and city of Caria. See B. v. c. 29.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Being alarmed by the pursuit of the fish while he was swimming.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Athen¾us, B. xiii., tells this story more at large, and states that thename of the child was Dionysius. Hardouin remarks, that Solinus, theape of Pliny, has absolutely read this passage as though the child's namehad been Babylon; upon the strength of which, Saumaise had proposed toalter the reading in Pliny, not remembering at the time that the boy's namehad been given by Atheneus.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This story is also told by Plutarch, in his work on the Instincts ofAnimals.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Anlus Gellius, B. vii. c. 8, mentions this story, borrowing it probablyfrom Theophrastus.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The people of the territory in which Amphilochian Argos was situate,and lying to the south of Ambracia.

See B.iv. c. 7. Solinus, c. 7, tells us that there was a temple of Arion of Methymna, situate on this spot, in which there was a figure of him seated ona dolphin's back, and made of bronze; with an inscription stating that thiswonderful circumstance took place in the 29th Olympiad, in which yearArion had been victorious in the Sicilian games. Philostorgius, in B. i. ofhis Ecclesiastical History, tells us also of a martyr who was saved by adolphin, which bore him to Helenopolis, a city of Nicomedia.</p></body>
