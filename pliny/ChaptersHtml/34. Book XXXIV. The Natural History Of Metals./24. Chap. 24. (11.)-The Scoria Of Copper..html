(11.)ÑTHE SCORIA OF COPPER.</head><p>The scoria, too, of copper is washed in the same manner; butthe action of it is less efficacious than that of copper itself.The flower, too, of copper<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> is also used in medicine; a substancewhich is procured by fusing copper, and then removing it intoanother furnace, where the repeated action of the bellowsmakes the metal separate into small scales, like the husks ofmillet, and known as "flower of copper." These scales arealso separated, when the cakes of metal are plunged intowater: they become red, too, like the scales of copper knownas "lepis,"<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> by means of which the genuine flower of copperis adulterated, it being also sold under that name. This last ismade by hammering nails that are forged from the cakes ofmetal. All these processes are principally carried on in thefurnaces of Cyprus; the great difference between these substancesbeing, that this lepis is detached from the cakes byhammering, whereas the flower falls off spontaneously.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"®ris flos." Ajasson makes some correct remarks upon the differencebetween the "scoria" and the "flower" of the metal. The formermay be considered as consisting of the metal, mixed with a certain proportionof heterogeneous matter, which has been separated during thefusion of the ore, while the latter consists of the pure metal in a state ofmechanical division.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From the Greek <foreign lang="greek">lepi\s</foreign>, "husk," or "scale,"</p></body>
