It has been said, that when sent aloft, they willpick<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> out the birds that are wanted, and that when the opportune moment for taking them has come, they invite the fowlerto seize the opportunity by their cries and their peculiar modeof flying. The sea-wolves, too, in the Palus Mæotis, do something of a very similar nature; but if they do not receive theirfair share from the fishermen, they will tear their nets as theylie extended.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> Hawks will not<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> eat the heart of a bird.
