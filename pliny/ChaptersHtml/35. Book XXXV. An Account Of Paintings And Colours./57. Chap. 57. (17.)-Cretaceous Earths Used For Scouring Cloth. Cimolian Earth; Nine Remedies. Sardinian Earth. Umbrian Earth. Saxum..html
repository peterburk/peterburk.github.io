<div2 type="chapter" n="57" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 57. (17.)—CRETACEOUS EARTHS USED FOR SCOURING CLOTH.CIMOLIAN EARTH; NINE REMEDIES. SARDINIAN EARTH. UMBRIANEARTH. SAXUM.</head><p>Of cretaceous<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> earths there are several varieties; and among<pb n="6300" />them, two kinds of Cimolian earth, employed in medicine, theone white and the other inclining to the tint of purpurissum.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>Both kinds, moistened with vinegar, have the effect of dispersingtumours and arresting defluxions. They are curativealso of inflammatory swellings and imposthumes of the parotidglands; and, applied topically, they are good for affections ofthe spleen and pustules on the body. With the addition ofaphronitrum,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> oil of cypros,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and vinegar, they reduceswellings of the feet, care being taken to apply the lotion inthe sun, and at the end of six hours to wash it off with saltand water. In combination with wax and oil of cypros,Cimolian earth is good for swellings of the testes.</p><p>Cretaceous earths, too, are of a cooling tendency, and,applied to the body in the form of a liniment, they act as acheck upon excessive perspiration: taken with wine, in thebath, they remove pimples on the body. The most esteemedof all these earths is that of Thessaly: it is found also in thevicinity of Bubon<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> in Lycia.</p><p>Cimolian earth is used also for another purpose, that ofscouring cloth. As to the kind which is brought from Sardinia,and is known as "sarda," it is used for white tissuesonly, and is never employed for coloured cloths. Indeed, thislast is held in the lowest estimation of all the Cimolian earths;whereas, that of Umbria is more highly esteemed, as also thekind generally known as "saxum."<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> It is a property ofthis last to increase in weight<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> by maceration, and it is byweight that it is usually sold, Sardinian earth being sold bymeasure. Umbrian earth is only used for giving lustre tocloths.</p><p>It will not be deemed out of place to give some furtheraccount here of this process, there being still in existence theMetilian Law, relative to fullers; an enactment which C.Flaminius and L. Æmilius, in their censorship,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> had passed by<pb n="6301" />the people,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> so attentive to everything were our ancestors.The following then is the method employed in preparingcloth: it is first washed in an infusion of Sardinian earth, andis then exposed to a fumigation with sulphur. This done, it isscoured<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> with Cimolian earth, when the cloth has been foundto be of a genuine colour; it being very soon detected when ithas been coloured with spurious materials, by its turningblack and the colours becoming dispersed<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> by the action of thesulphur. Where the colours are genuine and rich, they aresoftened by the application of Cimolian earth; which brightensand freshens them also when they have been rendered sombreby the action of the sulphur. Saxum is better for white tissues,after the application of sulphur, but to coloured cloths it ishighly injurious.<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> In Greece they use Tymphæan<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> gypsum inplace of Cimolian earth.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cimolian earth, known in modern chemistry as Cimolite, is not a cretaceous earth, but an aluminous silicate, still found in the island ofKimoli, or Argentiera, one of the Cyclades; See B. iv. c. 23. Tournefortdescribes it as a white chalk, very heavy, tasteless, and dissolving inwater. It is found also at Alexandrowsk in Russia.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See Chapter 25 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxxi. c. 46.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xii. c. 51.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. v. c. 28.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Beckmann thinks that this may have been our common chalk.Vol. II. p. 105.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This <hi rend="ital">seems</hi> to be the meaning of "crescit in macerando."</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A.U.C. 535, it is supposed.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">As a plebiscitum.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Desquamatur."
