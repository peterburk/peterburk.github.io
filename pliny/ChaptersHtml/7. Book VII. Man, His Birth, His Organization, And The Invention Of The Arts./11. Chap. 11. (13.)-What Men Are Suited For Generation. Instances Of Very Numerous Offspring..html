<div2 type="chapter" n="11" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 11. (13.)ÑWHAT MEN ARE SUITED FOR GENERATION. INSTANCES OF VERY NUMEROUS OFFSPRING.</head><p>There exists a kind of peculiar antipathy between the bodies<pb n="2149" />of certain persons, which, though barren with respect toeach other, are not so when united to others;<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> such, for instance, was the case with Augustus and Livia.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> Certain individuals, again, both men and women, produce only females,others males; and, still more frequently, children of the twosexes alternately; the mother of the Gracchi, for instance,who had twelve children, and Agrippina, the mother of Germanicus, who had nine. Some women, again, are barren intheir youth, while to others it is given to bring forth once onlyduring their lives. Some women never go to their full time,or if, by dint of great care and the aid of medicine, they dogive birth to a living child, it is mostly a girl. Among otherinstances of rare occurrence, is the case of Augustus, nowdeified, who, in the year in which he departed this life, witnessed the birth of M. Silanus,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> the grandson of his granddaughter: having obtained the government of Asia, afterhis consulship, he was poisoned by Nero, on his accession to thethrone.</p><p>Q. Metellus Macedonicus,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> leaving six children, left elevengrandsons also, with daughters-in-law and sons-in-law,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>twenty-seven individuals in all, who addressed him by thename and title of father. In the records of the times of theEmperor Augustus, now deified, we find it stated that, in histwelfth consulship, Lucius Sylla being his colleague, on the<pb n="2150" />third day before the ides of April,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> C. Crispinus Hilarus, aman of a respectable family of the plebeian order, living atF¾sul¾,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> came to the Capitol, to offer sacrifice, attended byeight children (of whom two were daughters), twenty-eightgrandsons, nineteen great-grandsons, and eight granddaughters,who all followed him in a lengthened train.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This opinion is maintained by Hippocrates, and by Aristotle, Hist.Anim.
