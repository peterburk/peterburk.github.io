<div2 type="chapter" n="110" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 110. (106.)—PLACES WHICH ARE ALWAYS BURNING.</head><p>Among the wonders of mountains there is Ætna, whichalways burns in the night<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>, and for so long a period hasalways had materials for combustion, being in the winterburied in snow, and having the ashes which it has ejectedcovered with frost. Nor is it in this mountain alone thatnature rages, threatening to consume the earth<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>; in Pha-<pb n="1140" />selis, the mountain Chimæra burns, and indeed with a continual flame, day andnight<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>. Ctesias of Cnidos informs us,that this fire is kindled by water, while it is extinguishedby earth and by hay<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>. In the same country of Lycia, themountains of Hephæstius, when touched with a flamingtorch<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>, burn so violently, that even the stones in the riverand the sand burn, while actually in the water: this fire isalso increased by rain. If a person makes furrows in theground with a stick which has been kindled at this fire, itis said that a stream of flame will follow it. The summit ofCophantus, in Bactria<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>, burns during the night; and this isthe case in Media and at Sittacene<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>, on the borders of Persia; likewise in Susa, at the White Tower, fromfifteen apertures<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>, the greatest of which also burns inthe daytime.The plain of Babylon throws up flame from a place like a fishpond<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>, an acre in extent. Near Hesperium, amountain ofthe Æthiopians<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>, the fields shine in the night-time like stars;the same thing takes place in the territory of the Megalopo-<pb n="1141" />litani. This fire, however, is internal<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>, mild, and not burning the foliage of a dense wood which is overit<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>. There isalso the crater of Nymphæum<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>, which is always burning, inthe neighbourhood of a cold fountain, and which, accordingto Theopompus, presages direful calamities to the inhabitantsof Apollonia<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>. Itis increased by rain<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>, and it throws outbitumen, which, becoming mixed with the fountain, rendersit unfit to be tasted; it is, at other times, the weakest of allthe bitumens. But what are these compared to otherwonders? Hiera, one of the Æolian isles, in the middle ofthe sea, near Italy, together with the sea itself, during theSocial war, burned for several days<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span>, until expiation wasmade, by a deputation from the senate. There is a hill inÆthiopia called <foreign lang="greek">Qew=n</foreign> <foreign lang="greek">o)/xhma</foreign><span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span>, which burns with the greatestviolence, throwing out flame that consumes everything, likethe sun<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span>. In so many places, and with so manyfires, doesnature burn the earth!</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">When the volcanos are less active the flame isvisible in the nightonly.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The observations of moderntravellers and geologists have proved, that the number of extinct volcanos isconsiderably greater than thosenow in action.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Chimæra was a volcano in Lycia, not far from the Xanthus; thecircumstance of its summit emitting flame, while its sides were the resortof various savage animals, probably gave rise to the fabulous story of theCentaur of this name, a ferocious monster who was continually vomitingforth flame.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The word in the text is "fœnum"; Hardouin suggeststhat themeaning of the author may have been litter, or the refuse of stables.Lemaire, i. 454.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The emission of a gas, which may be kindled by the application offlame, is a phenomenon of no very rare occurrence; but the effects are,no doubt, much exaggerated.
