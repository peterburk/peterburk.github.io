Hence was derived the custom, on the marriage of ayoung woman, of carrying in the procession a dressed distaffand a spindle, with the thread arranged upon it. Tanaquil wasthe first who wove the straight tunic,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> such as our youngpeople wear with the white toga;<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> newly-married women also.Waved garments were at first the most esteemed of all: afterwhich those composed of various colours<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> came into vogue.Fenestella informs us, that togas with a smooth surface, as well<pb n="2337" />as the Phryxian togas,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> began to be used in the latter part of thereign of Augustus. Thick stuffs, in the preparation of whichthe poppy<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> was used, are of more ancient date, being mentioned by the poet Lucilius, in his lines on Torquatus. Theprætexta<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> had its origin among the Etrurians. I find thatthe trabea<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> was first worn by the kings; embroidered garmentsare mentioned by Homer,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> and in this class originated thetriumphal robes.<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> The Phrygians first used the needle forthis purpose,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> and hence this kind of garment obtained thename of Phrygionian. King Attalus, who also lived in Asia,invented the art of embroidering with gold, from which thesegarments have been called Attalic.<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> Babylon was very famousfor making embroidery in different colours, and hence stuffs ofthis kind have obtained the name of Babylonian.<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> The method of weaving cloth with more than two threads was in-<pb n="2338" />vented at Alexandria; these cloths are called polymita;<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> itwas in Gaul that they were first divided into chequers.<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> Metellus Scipio, in the accusation which he brought againstCato,<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> stated that even in his time Babylonian covers forcouches were selling for eight hundred thousand sesterces, andthese of late, in the time of the Emperor Nero, had risen tofour millions.<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> The prætextæ of Servius Tullius, with whichthe statue of Fortune, dedicated by him, was covered,<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> lasteduntil the death of Sejanus; and it is a remarkable fact, that,during a period of five hundred and sixty years, they had neverbecome tattered,<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> or received injury from moths. I myselfhave seen the fleece upon the living animal dyed purple,scarlet, and violet,—a pound and a half<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> of dye being used foreach,—just as though they had been produced by Nature inthis form, to meet the demands of luxury.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This deity was also called Sangus, or Semo Sancus; and Ovid, Fasti,B. vi. c. 216, <hi rend="ital">et seq.,</hi> gives us much information concerning him. He wasof Sabine origin, and identical with Hercules and Dius Fidius. If wemay judge from the derivation of the name, it is not improbable that hepresided over the sanctity of oaths. His temple at Rome was on theQuirinal, opposite to that of Quirinus, and near the gate which from himderived the name of "Sanqualis porta." He was said to have been thefather of the Sabine hero Sabus.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">According to the commonly received account, Tanaquil was the wifeof Tarquinius Priscus, and a native of Etruria; when she removed toRome, and her husband became king, her name was changed to CaiaCæcilia.—B.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Undulata;" it has been suggested that this means the same as ourstuffs which we term "watered."—B.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Tunica recta;" according to Festus, it was "so called from beingwoven perpendicularly by people standing."—B. It probably means wovenfrom top to bottom and cross-wise in straight lines.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Toga pura;" so called from being white, without a mixture of anyother colour.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Sororiculata;" there is much uncertainty respecting the derivationof this word and its meaning, but it is generally supposed to signify somekind of stuff, composed of a mixture of different ingredients or of differentcolours.—B. "Orbiculata," "with round spots," is one reading, andprobably the correct one.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">According to Hardouin, these were cloths which imitated the crispand prominent hair of the Phryxian fleece, Lemaire, vol. iii. p. 529. Someeditions read "Phrygianas."</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Papaverata;" there is considerable difficulty in ascertaining themeaning of this word, as applied to garments. Pliny, in two other passages,speaks of a certain species of poppy—"from this, linens receive a peculiarwhiteness," B. xix. "From this, linens receive a brilliant whiteness intime," B. xx. c. 78. It would appear, in these cases, that the fibres of thestem of the poppy were mixed with the flax; though, perhaps, this wouldbe scarcely practicable with wool.—B.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The prætexta is described by Varro as a white toga, with a purpleband; it was worn by males, until their seventeenth year, and by youngwomen until their marriage.—B.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The trabea differed from the prætexta, in being ornamented withstripes (trabes) of purple, whence its name.—B.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Helen is introduced, Il. B. iii. 1. 125, weaving an embroidered garzment, in which were figured the battles of the Greeks and Trojans. It wasprobably somewhat of the nature of modern tapestry.—B.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. ix. c. 60.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This passage, in which the needle is said to have been used, provesthat when the word I "pictæ" is applied to garments, it is equivalent to ourterm "embroidered."—B.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny refers to the "Attalica tunica," B. xxxiii. c. 29, and to the"Attalica vestis," B. xxxvi. c. 20, and B. xxxvii. c. 6; Propertius speaksof "Attalica aulæa," B. ii. c. 32, 1. 12, "Attalicas torus," B. ii. c. 13, 122,and B. iv. c. 5, 1. 24, and "Attalicæ vestes," B. iii. c. 18, 1. 19.—B.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Plautus, Stich. A. ii. s. 2, 1. 54, speaks of "Babylonica peristromata,consuta tapetia," "Babylonian hangings, and embroidered tapestry;" andMartial, B. viii. Ep. 28, 1. 17, 18, of "Babylonica texta," "Babyloniantextures."—B.</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From Martial's epigram, entitled "Cubicularia polymita," B. xiv. Ep.150, we may conclude that the Egyptian polymita were formed in a loom,and of the nature of tapestry, while the Babylonian were embroidered withthe needle. Plautus probably refers to the Egyptian tapestry, in thePseud. A. i. s. 2, 1. 14, "Neque Alexandrina belluata conchyliata tapetia"—"Nor yet the Alexandrine tapestries, figured over with beasts and shells."</p><p><span id="note_17"><a href="#ref_17">17. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Scutulis divider." This term may mean "squares," "diamonds,"or "lozenges," something like the segments into which a spider's web isdivided. It is not improbable that he alludes here to the plaids of theGallic nations.</p><p><span id="note_18"><a href="#ref_18">18. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We have an account of this contention in Plutarch, and we may presume that this accusation was produced at that time.—B.</p><p><span id="note_19"><a href="#ref_19">19. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The first sum amounts to about £4,600 sterling, the latter to£23,000.—B.</p><p><span id="note_20"><a href="#ref_20">20. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The following lines in Ovid, Fasti, B. vi. 1. 509, <hi rend="ital">et seq.,</hi> have beensupposed to refer to this temple, and prove that the account of it is correct."Lux eadem, Fortuna, tuaque est, auctorque, locusque.<lb />"Sed superinjectis quis latet æde togis?<lb />"Servius est ..."<lb /><p>"The same day is thine, O Fortune; the same the builder, the same thesite. But who is this that lies hid beneath the garments covering him?It is Servius."</p></p><p><span id="note_21"><a href="#ref_21">21. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Perhaps "changed their colour" may be a better translation of "do—fluxisse."</p><p><span id="note_22"><a href="#ref_22">22. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Sesquipedalibus libris." It seems impossible to translate this literally. Hardouin explains it by supposing that the fleeces were dyed instrips of three colours, each strip being half a foot in breadth, and thatthree of these required a pound of the dyeing materials.—B.</p></body>
