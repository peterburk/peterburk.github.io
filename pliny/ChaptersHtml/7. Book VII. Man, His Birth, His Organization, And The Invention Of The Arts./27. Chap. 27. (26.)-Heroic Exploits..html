(26.)—HEROIC EXPLOITS.</head><p>But now, as it belongs fully as much to the glorious renownof the Roman Empire, as to the victorious career of a singleindividual, I shall proceed on this occasion to make mention ofall the triumphs and titles of Pompeius Magnus: the splendourof his exploits having equalled not only that of those of Alexander the Great, but even of Hercules, and perhaps of FatherLiber<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> even. After having recovered Sicily, where he firstcommenced his career as a partizan of Sylla, but in behalf ofthe republic, after having conquered the whole of Africa, andreduced it to subjection, and after having received for his shareof the spoil the title of " Great,"<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> he was decreed the honoursof a triumph; and he, though only of equestrian rank,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> athing that had never occurred before, re-entered the city in thetriumphal chariot: immediately after which, he hastened to thewest, where he left it inscribed on the trophy which he raisedupon the Pyrenees, that he had, by his victories, reduced tosubjection eight hundred and seventy-six cities, from the Alpsto the borders of Farther Spain; at the same time he most<pb n="2168" />magnanimously said not a word about Sertorius.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> Afterhaving put an end to the civil war, which indeed was theprimary cause of all the foreign ones, he, though still of onlyequestrian rank, again entered Rome in the triumphal chariot,having proved himself a general thus often before having beena soldier.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> After this, he was dispatched to the shores of allthe various seas, and then to the East, whence he brought backto his country the following titles of honour, resembling thereinthose who conquer at the sacred games—for, be it remembered, it is not they that are crowned, but their respectivecountries.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> These honours then did he award to the City,in the temple of Minerva,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> which he consecrated from thespoils that he had gained: "Cneius Pompeius Magnus, Imperator, having brought to an end a war of thirty years' duration, and having defeated, routed, put to the sword, or received the submission of, twelve millions two hundred andseventy-eight thousand men, having sunk or captured eighthundred and forty-six vessels, having received as allies onethousand five hundred and thirty-eight cities and fortresses,and having conquered all the country from the Mæotis to theRed Sea, dedicates this shrine as a votive offering due toMinerva." Such, in few words, is the sum of his exploits inthe East. The following are the introductory words descriptive of the triumph which he obtained, the third day beforethe calends<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> of October,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> in the consulship of M. Piso and<pb n="2169" />M. Messala;<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> "After having delivered the sea-coast fromthe pirates, and restored the seas to the people of Rome, heenjoyed a triumph over Asia, Pontus, Armenia, Paphlagonia,Cappadocia, Cilicia, Syria, the Scythians, Judæa, the Albanians, Iberia, the island of Crete, the Basterni, and, in additionto all these, the kings Mithridates and Tigranes."</p><p>The most glorious, however, of all glories, resulting fromthese exploits, was, as he himself says, in the speech which hemade in public relative to his previous career, that Asia,which he received as the boundary of the empire, he left itscentre.<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> If any one should wish, on the other hand, in asimilar manner, to pass in review the exploits of Cæsar, whohas shown himself greater still than Pompeius, why then hemust enumerate all the countries in the world, a task, I maysay, without an end.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or Bacchus.—"Father Liber" is the name always given to him byPliny.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Magnus." Plutarch states, that, on his return from Africa, Syllasaluted him with the name of "Magnus," which surname he ever afterwards retained.—B.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Plutarch says, that the law did not allow a triumph to be granted toany one who was not either consul or prætor.—B.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Sertorius had joined the party of Marius and Cinna, in opposition tothat of Sylla. He fled into Spain, and maintained the war successfully inthat country, until he was treacherously assassinated by one of his supposedpartisans. This may appear a sufficient reason for his not being mentionedby Pompey.—B.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Toties imperator antequam miles." He had been raised to thehighest rank without passing through the various gradations of militarylife.—B.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Speaking of this honorary crown, Pliny says, B. xvi. c. 4, "At thepresent day it is not given to the victor himself, but proclamation is madethat he confers the crown upon his country."</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is noticed by the commentators, that Aulus Gellius, speaking ofthis building, calls it the Temple of Victory, B. x. c. 1; the error, it issupposed, may have arisen from Pompey having placed a statue of Victoryin the Temple.—B.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">29th of September.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny, referring to these events, in a subsequent place, B. xxvii. c. 6,says that it took place "pridie Kalend. Octob. die natalis sui." Plutarchinforms us, that the triumph lasted two days, a circumstance which may assist us in reconciling these dates. The same author gives a very minutedetail of all the transactions here referred to.—B.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">According to the chronology ordinarily adopted, this would be in theyear of the City 692.—B.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">By Asia, as we see from the geographical portion of this work, theancients often designated not the large tract to which we now apply thename, but a comparatively small district lying on the east of the Ægeansea.—B.</p></body>
