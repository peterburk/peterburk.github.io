<div2 type="chapter" n="31" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 31. (30.)ÑMEN WHO HAVE BEEN REMARKABLE FOR WISDOM.</head><p>Dionysius the tyrant, who otherwise manifested a naturalpropensity for cruelty and pride, sent a vessel crowned withgarlands to meet Plato, that high-priest of wisdom; and onhis disembarcation, received him on the shore, in a chariotdrawn by four white horses. Isocrates was able to sell asingle oration of his for twenty talents.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> ®schines, the greatAthenian orator, after he had read to the Rhodians the speechwhich he had made on the accusation of Demosthenes, readthe defence made by Demosthenes, through which he hadbeen driven into exile among them. When they expressedtheir admiration of it, "How much more," said he, "wouldyou have admired it, if you had heard him deliver it him-<pb n="2175" />self;"<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> a striking testimony, indeed, given in adversity, to themerit of an enemy! The Athenians sent their general, Thucydides, into banishment, but recalled him as their historian,admiring his eloquence, though they had punished his wantof valour.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> A strong testimony, too, was given to the meritof Menander, the famous comic poet, by the kings of Egyptand Macedonia, in sending to him a fleet and an embassy;though, what was still more honourable to him, he preferredenjoying the converse of his literary pursuits to the favour ofkings.</p><p>The nobles too of Rome have given their testimonies in favourof foreigners, even. Cn. Pompeius, after having finished thewar against Mithridates, when he went to call at the house ofPosidonius, the famous teacher of philosophy, forbade thelictor to knock at the door, as was the usual custom;<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and he,to whom both the eastern and the western world hadyielded submission, ordered the fasces to be lowered before thedoor of a learned man. Cato the Censor, after he had heardthe speech of Carneades,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> who was one of the embassy sent<pb n="2176" />from Athens, of three men famous for their learning, gave it ashis opinion, that the ambassadors ought to be dismissed as soonas possible, because, in consequence of his ingenious method ofarguing, it became extremely difficult to distinguish truth fromfalsehood.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> What an extraordinary change too in our modes ofthinking! This Cato constantly gave it out as his decided opinion that all Greeks ought to be expelled from Italy, while, onthe other hand, his great-grandson, Cato of Utica, upon hisreturn from his military tribuneship, brought back with him aphilosopher, and a second one<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> when he returned from hisembassy to Cyprus;<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> and it is a very remarkable fact, thatthe same language which had been proscribed by one of theCato's, was introduced among us by the other. But let us nowgive some account of the honours of our own countrymen.</p><p>The elder Africanus ordered that the statue of Ennius shouldbe placed in his tomb, and that the illustrious surname, whichhe had acquired, I may say, as his share of the spoil on theconquest of the third part of the world, should be read overhis ashes, along with the name of the poet.<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> The EmperorAugustus, now deified, forbade the works of Virgil to be burnt,in opposition to the modest directions to that effect, which thepoet had left in his will: a prohibition which was a greatercompliment paid to his merit, than if he himself had recommended his works.</p><p>M. Varro<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> is the only person, who, during his lifetime, saw<pb n="2177" />his own statue erected. This was placed in the first publiclibrary that was ever built, and which was formed by AsiniusPollio with the spoils of our enemies.<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> The fact of this distinction being conferred upon him by one who was in the firstrank, both as an orator and a citizen, and at a time, too, whenthere was so great a number of men distinguished for theirgenius, was not less honourable to him, in my opinion, thanthe naval crown which Pompeius Magnus bestowed upon himin the war against the pirates. The instances that followamong the Romans, if I were to attempt to reckon them,would be found to be innumerable; for it is the fact that thisone nation has furnished a greater number of distinguishedmen in every branch than all the countries of the world takentogether.<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span></p><p>But what atonement could I offer to thee, Marcus Tullius,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>were I to be silent respecting thy name? or on what groundam I to pronounce thee as especially pre-eminent? On what,indeed, that can be more convincing than the most abundanttestimony that was offered in thy favour by the whole Romanpeople? Contenting myself with the selection only of such of thegreat actions of the whole of your life, as were performed duringyour consulship.ÑYou speak, and the tribes surrender theAgrarian law, or, in other words, their very subsistence;<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> youadvise them to do so, and they pardon Roscius,<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> the author of the<pb n="2178" />law for the regulation of the theatres, and, without any feelingsof resentment, allow a mark to be put upon themselves by allotting them an inferior seat; you entreat, and the sons of proscribed men blush at having canvassed for public honours: before your genius, Catiline took to flight, and it was you whoproscribed M. Antonius. Hail then to thee, who wast the firstof all to receive the title of Father of thy country,<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> who wastthe first of all, while wearing the toga, to merit a triumph,and who didst obtain the laurel for oratory. Great father,thou, of eloquence and of Latin literature! as the DictatorC¾sar, once thy enemy, wrote in testimony of thee,<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> thoudidst require a laurel superior to every triumph! How fargreater and more glorious to have enlarged so immeasurably theboundaries of the Roman genius, than those of its sway!</p><p>(31.) Those persons among the Romans, who surpass allothers in wisdom, have the surnames of Catus and Corculus<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span>given to them. Among the Greeks, Socrates was declaredby the oracle of the Pythian Apollo to be superior to all othersin wisdom.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We may here refer to some remarks by Hardouin and Ajasson on theactual sum obtained by Isocrates; Lemaire, vol. iii. pp. 126, 127.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This anecdote is related by Cicero, De Oratore, B. iii. c. 56, and byVal. Maximus, B. viii. c. 10.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is rather a strong expression, and it is doubtful if the great historian at all deserves it. The facts of the case seem to have been as follow.Thucydides was employed in a military capacity, and was in command ofan Athenian squadron of seven ships at Thasos, B.C. <date value="-424" authname="-424">424</date>, when Eucles,who commanded in Amphipolis, sent for his assistance against Brasidas,who was before that town with an army. Fearing the arrival of a superiorforce, Brasidas offered favourable terms to Amphipolis, which were readilyaccepted, as there were but few Athenians in the place. Thucydides arrived at Eion, on the mouth of the Strymon, the evening of the same dayon which Amphipolis surrendered: and though too late to save Amphipolis,prevented Eion from falling into the hands of the enemy. It was in consequence of this failure, that he became voluntarily an exile, perhaps toavoid the still severer punishment of death, which appears to have beenthe penalty of such a failure as that which he had, though unavoidably,committed. It is most probable that he returned to Athens about B.C. <date value="-403" authname="-403">403</date>,the period of its liberation by Thrasybulus.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The following passage in Livy, B. vi. c. 34, may serve to illustrate thisremark of Pliny:Ñ"The lictors of Sulpicius, the military tribune, whenhe went home from the forum, knocked at the door with his staff, as theusual custom is."</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Of Cyrene, the Academic philosopher. In B.C. <date value="-155" authname="-155">155</date>, being then fifty-eight years old, he was chosen with some others to deprecate the fine of500 talents which had been imposed on the Athenians for the destructionof Oropus. It was then that, in presence of Cato the Elder, he delivered his famous orations on Justice. The first oration was in commendation ofthe virtue, and on the ensuing day the next was delivered, by which all thearguments of the first were answered, and justice shown to be not a virtue,but only a matter of compact for the maintenance of civil society. Thehonesty of Cato was greatly shocked at this, and he moved the senate tosend the philosopher back to his school, and save the Roman youth fromhis demoralizing doctrines. He lived twenty-eight years after this, anddied at Athens B.C. <date value="-129" authname="-129">129</date>, aged eighty-five, or, according to Cicero, ninety.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is related by Plutarch, in his Life of Cato. His general dislikeof the Grecian character is again mentioned, B. xxix. c. 7.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxxiv. c. 19.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We have an account of this embassy in Plutarch. Pliny informs us,B. xxxiv. c. 20, that the only article which Cato retained, of the works ofart that he brought from Cyprus, was the statue of Zeno, "not for its intrinsic merit, but because it was the statue of a philosopher." ValeriusPaterculus, B. ii. c. 45, and Plutarch refer to this transaction.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This circumstance is related by Valerius Maximus, B. viii. c. 14, andis referred to by Cicero in his defence of Archias, sec. 9.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">M. Varro, the philosopher, sometimes called "the most learned" of the Romans. His command under Pompey, in the war against the Pirates,has been already mentioned in B. iii. c. 16. He also served under himagainst Mithridates, and was his legatus in Spain, at the first outbreak ofthe civil wars.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny refers to the same subject: in B. xxxv. c. 2, he speaks of Pollioas "qui primus, bibliothecam dicando, ingenia hominum rempublicam fecit"Ñ"The first who, by forming a public library, made public property thegenius of learned men." Aulus Gellius, B. vi. c. 18, informs us, that thefirst library, formed for the use of the public, was that collected at Athensby Pisistratus.ÑB. Ptolemy Philadelphus, the king of Pergamus, andLucullus, had formed extensive libraries, but solely for their own use, andnot that of the public.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Some of these are given by Val. Maximus, B. viii. c. 15.ÑB. It isvery doubtful, however, if Greece did not greatly excel Rome in this respect.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Meaning Cicero, the orator and philosopher.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cicero, in an Epistle to Atticus, B. ii. c. i., enumerates what he styleshis consular orations: the total number is twelve, and among them we findall those here referred to by Pliny.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The individual referred to is L.
