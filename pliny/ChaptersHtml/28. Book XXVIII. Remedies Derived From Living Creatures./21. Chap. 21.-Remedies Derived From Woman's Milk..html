In cases, too, of sickness atstomach, fevers, and gnawing sensations, it has been found byexperience to be highly beneficial; as also, in combinationwith frankincense, for abscesses of the mamillæ. When theeyes are bloodshot from the effects of a blow, or affected withpain or defluxion, it is a very good plan to inject woman's milkinto them, more particularly in combination with honey andjuice of daffodil, or else powdered frankincense. In all cases,however, the milk of a woman who has been delivered of amale child is the most efficacious, and still more so if she hashad male twins; provided always she abstains from wine andfood of an acrid nature. Mixed with the white of an egg ina liquid state, and applied to the forehead in wool, it arrests<pb n="5303" />defluxions of the eyes. If a frog<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> has spirted its secretions<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>into the eye, woman's milk is a most excellent remedy; andfor the bite of that reptile it is used both internally and externally.</p><p>It is asserted that if a person is rubbed at the same momentwith the milk of both mother and daughter, he will be prooffor the rest of his life against all affections of the eyes.Mixed with a small quantity of oil, woman's milk is a cure fordiseases of the ears; and if they are in pain from the effectsof a blow, it is applied warm with goose-grease. If the earsemit an offensive smell, a thing that is mostly the case indiseases of long standing, wool is introduced into those organs,steeped in woman's milk and honey. While symptoms ofjaundice are still visible in the eyes, woman's milk is injected,in combination with elaterium.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> Taken as a drink, it is productive of singularly good effects, where the poison of thesea-hare, the buprestis,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> or, as Aristotle tells us, the plantdorycnium<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> has been administered; as a preventive also of themadness produced by taking henbane. Woman's milk also,mixed with hemlock, is recommended as a liniment for gout;while some there are who employ it for that purpose in combination with wool-grease<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> or goose-grease; a form in whichit is used as an application for pains in the uterus. Taken asa drink, it arrests diarrhœa, Rabirius<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> says, and acts as anemmenagogue; but where the woman has been delivered of afemale child, her milk is of use only for the cure of facediseases.</p><p>Woman's milk is also a cure for affections of the lungs; and,mixed with the urine of a youth who has not arrived at puberty, and Attic honey, in the proportion of one spoonfulof each, it removes singing in the ears, I find. Dogs whichhave once tasted the milk of a woman who has been deliveredof a male child, will never become mad, they say.<pb n="5304" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There is probably no foundation for this assertion.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Rana."
