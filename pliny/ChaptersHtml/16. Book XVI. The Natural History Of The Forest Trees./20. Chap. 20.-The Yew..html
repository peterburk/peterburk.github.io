It is of a colour, however,but slightly approaching to green, and of a slender form; ofsombre and ominous aspect, and quite destitute of juice: it isthe only one, too, among them all, that bears a berry. In themale tree the fruit is injurious; indeed, in Spain more particularly, the berries contain a deadly poison.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> It is an ascertainedfact that travellers' vessels,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> made in Gaul of this wood, for thepurpose of holding wine, have caused the death of those whoused them. Sextius says, that in Greece this tree is known bythe name of "smilax, "and that in Arcadia it is possessed of soactive a poison, that those who sleep beneath it, or even takefood<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> there, are sure to meet their death from it. There areauthors, also, who assert that the poisons which we call atthe present day "toxica," and in which arrows are dipped,were formerly called taxica,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> from this tree. It has beendiscovered, also, that these poisonous qualities are quite neutralized by driving a copper nail into the wood of the tree.<pb n="3361" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Taxus baccata of Linn¾us. The account here given is in generalvery correct.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is supposed that Pliny derives this notion as to the yew berry fromJulius C¾sar, who says that "Cativulcus killed himself with the yew, atree which grows in great abundance in Gaul and Germany."
