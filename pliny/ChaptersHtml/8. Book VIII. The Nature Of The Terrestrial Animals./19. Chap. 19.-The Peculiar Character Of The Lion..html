<div2 type="chapter" n="19" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 19.—THE PECULIAR CHARACTER OF THE LION.</head><p>The lion is the only one of all the wild beasts that showsmercy to the suppliant; after it has conquered, it will spare,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>and when enraged, it will vent its fury rather upon menthan women, and never upon children, unless when greatlypressed by hunger. It is the belief in Libya, that it fully understands the entreaties which are addressed to it. At all events,I have heard it asserted as a fact, that a female slave, who wasreturning from Gætulia, was attacked by a number of lions inthe forests; upon which she summoned sufficient courage to address them, and said that she was a woman, a fugitive, helpless creature, that she implored the compassion of the mostgenerous of animals, the one that has the command of all theothers, and that she was a prey unworthy of their high repute—and by these means effectually soothed their ferocity. There<pb n="2268" />are various opinions on this point, as to whether it is throughsome peculiar disposition of the animal, or merely by accident,that their fury is thus soothed by addressing them. As towhat is alleged, too, about serpents, that they can be drawnfrom their holes by singing, and thus be made to yield themselves up to death, the truth or falsity of it has not by anymeans been satisfactorily ascertained.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span></p><p>The tail of the lion gives indication of the state of his feelings,just as the ears do in the horse; for these are the distinguishingsigns which Nature has given to each of the most generous ofanimals. Hence it is that, when pleased, the tail is withoutmotion, and the animal fawns upon those who caress him; athing, however, that very rarely happens, for his most frequent state is that of rage. He begins by beating the earthwith his tail; and as he becomes more furious, he lashes hissides, as if trying to excite himself. His greatest strengthis situate in the breast. From every wound that he makes,whether it is with his claws or his teeth, a black blood issues.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>When his hunger is satisfied, he becomes harmless. The generous disposition of the lion is more especially manifested intime of danger; not only at the moment when, despising allweapons, he long defends himself solely by the terror which heinspires, and protests, as it were, that he is compelled thus to defend himself, but when he rises at last, not as though constrainedby danger, but as if enraged by the mad folly of his adversaries.This, however, is a still more noble feature of his courage—however numerous the dogs and hunters may be that pressupon him, as he makes his retreat he comes to a stand every nowand then upon the level plain, while he is still in view, andscowls contemptuously upon them: but as soon as ever he hasentered the thickets and dense forests, he scours away at theswiftest possible pace, as though aware that the place itselfwill shelter his shame. When in pursuit, the lion advances witha leap, but he does not do so when in flight. When wounded,he discovers, with wonderful sagacity, the person who struck theblow, and will find him out, however great may have been the<pb n="2269" />multitude of his pursuers. If a person has thrown a dart athim, but has failed to inflict a wound, the animal seizes him,whirls him round and throws him to the ground, but withoutwounding him. When the lioness is defending her whelps, it issaid that she fixes her eyes steadily on the ground, that shemay not be frightened at the spears of the hunters. In allother respects, these animals are equally free from deceit andsuspicion. They never look at an object obliquely, and theydislike being looked at themselves in such a manner. It isgenerally believed, that, when the lion is dying, he bites at theearth, and sheds tears at his fate.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> Powerful, however, andfierce as this animal is, he is terrified by the motion of wheelsor of an empty chariot, and still more on seeing the crest orhearing the crowing of a cock;<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> but most of all, is he afraid offire. The only malady to which the lion is subject, is loss ofappetite; this, however, is cured by putting insults upon him,by means of the pranks of monkeys placed about him, a thingwhich rouses his anger; immediately he tastes their blood, he isrelieved.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Although these accounts of the generosity and clemency of the lionare in a great measure fabulous, still the accounts of those who have hadthe best opportunity of becoming acquainted with the character of different animals, agree in ascribing to it less ferocity and brutality, in proportion to its size and strength, than to other animals of the same family.—B.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In various countries, and more especially in Egypt, the magicians profess to charm serpents by incantations; and it appears that they are able toacquire some power over them by imitating their natural cries. Cuvierinforms us, that Geoffroi St. Hilaire had witnessed the fact, and was himself able to produce the effect.—B.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle says, a matter of a <hi rend="ital">yellow</hi> colour, <foreign lang="greek">i)xw=res w)xro\i.</foreign></p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably, there is no foundation for this opinion: it does not appearthat any animal, except man, has the faculty of weeping, <hi rend="ital">i. e.</hi> of sheddingtears, in connection with a peculiar condition of mind and feeling.—B. Butquery as to the horse. See c. 64 of the present Book, and the Introduction to vol. i. p. xvii.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This supposed fear is without foundation, but appears to have been agenerally received opinion, as it is referred to by Lucretius, B. iv. 1. 714—725.—B.</p></body>
