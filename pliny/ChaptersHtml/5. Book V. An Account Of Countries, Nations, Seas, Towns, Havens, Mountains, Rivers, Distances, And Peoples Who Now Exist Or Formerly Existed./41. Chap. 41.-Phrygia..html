<div2 type="chapter" n="41" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 41.ÑPHRYGIA.</head><p>Phrygia lies above Troas, and the peoples already men-<pb n="1491" />tioned as extending from the Promontory of Lectum<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> tothe river Etheleus. On its northern side it borders uponGalatia, on the south it joins Lyeaonia, Pisidia, and Mygdonia,and, on the east, it touches upon Cappadocia. Themore celebrated towns there, besides those already mentioned,are Ancyra<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>, Andria, Cel¾n¾<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>, Coloss¾<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, Carina<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>,Cotyaion<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>, Ceraine, Conium, and Midaium. There areauthors who say that the MÏsi, the Brygi, and the Thynicrossed over from Europe, and that from them are descendedthe peoples called the Mysi, Phryges, and Bithyni.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cape Baba, or Santa Maria; the south-western promontory ofthe Troad.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In Phrygia Epictetus, or "Conquered Phrygia," so called from itsconquest by certain of the kings of Bithynia. Strabo calls this place a"small city, or hill-fortress, towards Lydia." It was probably situatenear the source of the Macestus, now the Susugherli Su, or the SimaulSu, as it is called in its upper course.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The place from which the citizens were removed to Apamea, as mentionedin C. 29 of the present Book. Hamilton (Researches, &amp;c., p. 499)supposes its acropolis to have been situate about half a mile from thesources of the river Marsyas.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">First mentioned by Herodotus, and situate on the Lycus, a branchof the M¾ander. It had greatly declined in Strabo's time, and in themiddle ages there rose near it a town of the name of Chon¾, and Coloss¾disappeared. Hamilton found extensive ruins of an ancient city aboutthree miles north of the modern Khonos. It was one of the early Christianchurches of Asia, and the Apostle Paul addressed one of his Epistlesto the people of this place. It does not appear from it that he had evervisited the place; indeed, from Chap. ii. 1 we may conclude that hehad not.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This does not appear to be the same as the Carine mentioned inC. 32 of this Book, as having gone to decay. Its site is unknown. </p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or Coti¾um, or Coty¾um. It was on the Roman road fromDoryl¾um to Philadelphia, and in Phrygia Epictetus, according toStrabo. The modern Kutahiyah is supposed to denote its site; butthere are no remains of antiquity.</p></body>
