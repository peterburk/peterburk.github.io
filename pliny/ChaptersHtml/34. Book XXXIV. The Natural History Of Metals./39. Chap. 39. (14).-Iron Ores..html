(14).ÑIRON ORES.</head><p>Next to copper we must give an account of the metal knownas iron, at the same time the most useful and the most fatalinstrument in the hand of mankind. For by the aid of ironwe lay open the ground, we plant trees, we prepare our vineyard-trees,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>and we force our vines each year to resume theiryouthful state, by cutting away their decayed branches. It isby the aid of iron that we construct houses, cleave rocks, andperform so many other useful offices of life. But it is withiron also that wars, murders, and robberies are effected, andthis, not only hand to hand, but from a distance even, by theaid of missiles and winged weapons, now launched from engines,now hurled by the human arm, and now furnished withfeathery wings. This last I regard as the most criminalartifice that has been devised by the human mind; for, asif to bring death upon man with still greater rapidity, wehave given wings to iron and taught it to fly.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> Let us there-<pb n="6206" />fore acquit Nature of a charge that here belongs to man himself.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span></p><p>Indeed there have been some instances in which it has beenproved that iron might be solely used for innocent purposes.In the treaty which Porsena granted to the Roman people, afterthe expulsion of the kings, we find it expressly stipulated, thatiron shall be only employed for the cultivation of the fields;and our oldest authors inform us, that in those days it wasconsidered unsafe to write with an iron pen.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> There is an edictextant, published in the third consulship of Pompeius Magnus,during the tumults that ensued upon the death of Clodius,prohibiting any weapon from being retained in the City.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">" Arbusta:" trees on which vines were trained.
