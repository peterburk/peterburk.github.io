<div2 type="chapter" n="34" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 34. (19.)—FISHES WHICH HAVE A VOICE .— FISHES WITHOUT GILLS.</head><p>Arcadia produces a wonder in its fish called exocœtus,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> fromthe fact that it comes ashore to sleep. In the neighbourhoodof the river Clitorius,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> this fish is said to be gifted with powersof speech, and to have no gills;<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> by some writers it is calledthe adonis.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot"><foreign lang="greek">)Apo\ to=n e)/cw koita=n,</foreign> "from its sleeping out of the water." Thisfish is also mentioned by Theophrastus, in his Fragment on the "Fish thatlive on dry land;" by Clearchus the Peripatetic, as quoted by Athenæus,B. viii.; Oppian, in his Halieutics, B. i. 1. 158; and. Ælian, Hist. Anim.B. ix. c. 36. The fish, however, mentioned by all these authorities, is a sea-fish, while that of Pliny, being found in Arcadia, must, of necessity, be a riverfish. The proper name of the fish here mentioned by him was <foreign lang="greek">poikili/as,</foreign>Hardouin says, so called from the variety of its colours. Cuvier says, thatthe fish here mentioned is not the Exocœtus of Linnæus, which is one ofthe flying fish, but is clearly of opinion that it is one of the genus Blennius, or Gobio, that is alluded to; for these small fish are often to be foundleft on the shore when the waters retire, and have the property of beingable to remain alive for a considerable time without water.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In the river Aroanius, which falls into the Clitorius. Pausaniasmentions this story, but adds, that he never could hear the fish, althoughhe often went there to listen, Mnaseas of Patræ, an author quoted byAthenæus, B. viii., also mentions these vocal fishes.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier understands this to mean only, that the openings of the gillsare remarkably small: for, as he says, there is no fish whatever withoutgills. It is very possible, however, that Pliny may have mistranslated apassage found in Athenæus, and quoted from Clearchus the Peripatetic,in which he says that some fish have a voice, and yet have no throat,<foreign lang="greek">bro/gxon;</foreign> which may have, possibly, been mistaken by our author for<foreign lang="greek">bra/gxia,</foreign> "gills."</p></body>
