<div2 type="chapter" n="23" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 23.—FACTS CONNECTED WITH THE MENSTRUAL DISCHARGE.</head><p>Over and above these particulars, there is no limit to themarvellous powers attributed to females. For, in the firstplace, hailstorms, they say, whirlwinds, and lightning<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> even,will be scared away by a woman uncovering her body whileher monthly courses are upon her. The same, too, with allother kinds of tempestuous weather; and out at sea, a stormmay be lulled by a woman uncovering her body merely, eventhough not menstruating at the time. As to the menstrualdischarge itself, a thing that in other respects, as<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> alreadystated on a more appropriate occasion, is productive of the mostmonstrous effects, there are some ravings about it of a mostdreadful and unutterable nature. Of these particulars, however, I do not feel so much shocked at mentioning the following. If the menstrual discharge coincides with an eclipse ofthe moon or sun, the evils resulting from it are irremediable;and no less so, when it happens while the moon is in conjunction with the sun; the congress with a woman at such a periodbeing noxious, and attended with fatal effects to the man. Atthis period also, the lustre of purple is tarnished by the touchof a woman: so much more baneful is her influence at thistime than at any other. At any other time, also, if a womanstrips herself naked while she is menstruating, and walksround a field of wheat, the caterpillars, worms, beetles, andother vermin, will fall from off the ears of corn. Metrodorusof Scepsos tells us that this discovery was first made in Cappadocia; and that, in consequence of such multitudes of can-<pb n="5305" />tharides being found to breed there, it is the practice forwomen to walk through the middle of the fields with theirgarments tucked up above the thighs.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> In other places, again,it is the usage for women to go barefoot, with the hairdishevelled and the girdle loose: due precaution must be taken,however, that this is not done at sun-rise, for if so, the cropwill wither and dry up. Young vines, too, it is said, are injured irremediably by the touch of a woman in this state; andboth rue and ivy, plants possessed of highly medicinal virtues,will die instantly upon being touched by her.</p><p>Much as I have already stated on the virulent effects of thisdischarge, I have to state, in addition, that bees, it is a well-known fact, will forsake their hives if touched by a menstruouswoman; that linen boiling in the cauldron will turn black, thatthe edge of a razor will become blunted, and that copper vessels will contract a fetid smell and become covered with verdigrease, on coming in contact with her. A mare big with foal,if touched by a woman in this state, will be sure to miscarry;nay, even more than this, at the very sight of a woman,though seen at a distance even, should she happen to bemenstruating for the first time after the loss of her virginity,or for the first time, while in a state of virginity. The bitumen<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> that is found in Judæa, will yield to nothing but themenstrual discharge; its tenacity being overcome, as alreadystated, by the agency of a thread from a garment which hasbeen brought in contact with this fluid. Fire itself even, anelement which triumphs over every other substance, is unableto conquer this; for if reduced to ashes and then sprinkledupon garments when about to be scoured, it will change theirpurple tint, and tarnish the brightness of the colours. Indeedso pernicious are its properties, that women themselves, thesource from which it is derived, are far from being proof againstits effects; a pregnant woman, for instance, if touched withit, or indeed if she so much as steps over it, will be liable tomiscarry.</p><p>Laïs and Elephant is<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> have given statements quite at variance, on the subject of abortives; they mention the efficacy<pb n="5306" />for that purpose of charcoal of cabbage root, myrtle root, ortamarisk root, quenched in the menstrual discharge; they saythat she-asses will be barren for as many years as they haveeaten barley-corns steeped in this fluid; and they have enumerated various other monstrous and irreconcileable properties,the one telling us, for instance, that fruitfulness may be ensuredby the very same methods, which, according to the statementof the other, are productive of barrenness; to all which stories itis the best plan to refuse credit altogether. Bithus of Dyrrhachium informs us that a mirror,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> which has been tarnished bythe gaze of a menstruous female, will recover its brightness ifthe same woman looks steadily upon the back of it; he states,also, that all evil influences of this nature will be entirelyneutralized, if the woman carries the fish known as the surmullet about her person.</p><p>On the other hand, again, many writers say that, baneful asit is, there are certain remedial properties in this fluid; that itis a good plan, for instance, to use it as a topical application forgout, and that women, while menstruating, can give relief bytouching scrofulous sores and imposthumes of the parotidglands, inflamed tumours, erysipelas, boils, and defluxions ofthe eyes. According to Laïs and Salpe, the bite of a mad (log,as well as tertian or quartan fevers, may be cured by puttingsome menstruous blood in the wool of a black ram and enclosing it in a silver bracelet; and we learn from Diotimus ofThebes that the smallest portion will suffice of any kind ofcloth that has been stained therewith, a thread even, if inserted and worn in a bracelet. The midwife Sotira informsus that the most efficient cure for tertian and quartan fevers isto rub the soles of the patient's feet therewith, the result beingstill more successful if the operation is performed by the womanherself, without the patient being aware of it; she says, too,that this is an excellent method for reviving persons whenattacked with epilepsy.</p><p>Icetidas the physician pledges his word that quartan fevermay be cured by sexual intercourse, provided the woman isjust beginning to menstruate. It is universally agreed, too, thatwhen a person has been bitten by a dog and manifests a dreadof water and of all kinds of drink, it will be quite sufficientto put under his clip a strip of cloth that has been dipped in<pb n="5307" />this fluid; the result being that the hydrophobia will immediately disappear. This arises, no doubt, from that powerfulsympathy which has been so much spoken of by the Greeks,and the existence of which is proved by the fact,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> already mentioned, that dogs become mad upon tasting this fluid. It is a well-known fact, too, that the menstruous discharge, reduced to ashes,and applied with furnace soot and wax, is a cure for ulcers uponall kinds of beasts of burden; and that stains made upon a garment with it can only be removed by the agency of the urineof the same female. Equally certain it is, too, that this fluid, reduced to ashes and mixed with oil of roses, is very useful, appliedto the forehead, for allaying head-ache, in women more particularly; as also that the nature of the discharge is most virulent in females whose virginity has been destroyed solely bythe lapse of time.</p><p>Another thing universally acknowledged and one which Iam ready to believe with the greatest pleasure, is the fact, thatif the door-posts are only touched with the menstruous fluidall spells of the magicians will be neutralized—a set of menthe most lying in existence, as any one may ascertain. I willgive an example of one of the most reasonable of their prescriptions—Take the parings of the toe-nails and finger-nailsof a sick person, and mix them up with wax, the party sayingthat he is seeking a remedy for a tertian, quartan, or quotidianfever, as the case may be; then stick this wax, before sunrise,upon the door of another person—such is the prescription theygive for these diseases! What deceitful persons they must beif there is no truth in it! And how highly criminal, if theyreally do thus transfer diseases from one person to another!Some of them, again, whose practices are of a less guiltynature, recommend that the parings of all the finger-nailsshould be thrown at the entrance of ant-holes, the first ant to betaken which attempts to draw one into the hole; this, they say,must be attached to the neck of the patient, and he will experience a speedy cure.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The mention of lightning here, Hardouin seems to look upon as aninterpolation.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. vii. c. 13.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Columella describes this practice in verse, in B. x., and in B. xi. c. 3.Ælian also mentions it.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. vii. c. 13.
