<div2 type="chapter" n="8" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 8.ÑAT WHAT PERIOD FOREIGN PAINTINGS WERE FIRSTINTRODUCED AT ROME.</head><p>The high estimation in which the paintings of foreigners wereheld at Rome commenced with Lucius Mummius, who, fromhis victories, acquired the surname of "Achaicus." For uponthe sale of the spoil on that occasion, King Attalus having purchased,at the price of six thousand denarii, a painting of FatherLiber by Aristides,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> Mummius, feeling surprised at theprice, and suspecting that there might be some merit in it ofwhich he himself was unaware,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> in spite of the complaints ofAttalus, broke off the bargain, and had the picture placed inthe Temple of Ceres;<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> the first instance, I conceive, of a foreignpainting being publicly exhibited at Rome.</p><p>After this, I find, it became a common practice to exhibitforeign pictures in the Forum; for it was to this circumstancethat we are indebted for a joke of the orator Crassus. Whilepleading below the Old Shops,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> he was interrupted by a witnesswho had been summoned, with the question, "Tell me then,Crassus, what do you take me to be?" "Very much likehim," answered he, pointing to the figure of a Gaul in a picture, thrusting out his tongue in a very unbecoming manner.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>It was in the Forum, too, that was placed the picture of theOld Shepherd leaning on his staff; respecting which, when theenvoy of the Teutones was asked what he thought was thevalue of it, he made answer that he would rather not havethe original even, at a gift.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See Chapter 36 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We have an amusing proof of this ignorance of Mummius given byPaterculus, B. i. c. 13, who says that when he had the choicest of theCorinthian statues and pictures sent to Italy, he gave notice to the contractorsthat if they lost any of them, they must be prepared to supply newones. Ajasson offers a conjecture which is certainly plausible, that Mummiusmight possibly regard this painting as a species of talisman.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In the Eleventh Region of the City.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Sub Veteribus;" meaning that part of the Forum where the "OldShops" of the "argentarii" or money-brokers had stood.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We have an anecdote of a similar event, related by Cicero, as havingoccurred to Julius C¾sar, De Oratore, B. ii. c. 66.ÑB.</p></body>
