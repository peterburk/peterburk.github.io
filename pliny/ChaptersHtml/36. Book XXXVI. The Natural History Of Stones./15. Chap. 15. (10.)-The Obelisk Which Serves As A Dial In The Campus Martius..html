<div2 type="chapter" n="15" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 15. (10.)—THE OBELISK WHICH SERVES AS A DIAL IN THECAMPUS MARTIUS.</head><p>The one that has been erected in the Campus Martius<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> hasbeen applied to a singular purpose by the late EmperorAugustus; that of marking the shadows projected by the sun,and so measuring the length of the days and nights. With thisobject, a stone pavement was laid, the extreme length ofwhich corresponded exactly with the length of the shadowthrown by the obelisk at the sixth hour<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> on the day of the wintersolstice. After this period, the shadow would go on, day byday, gradually decreasing, and then again<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> would as graduallyincrease, correspondingly with certain lines of brass that wereinserted in the stone; a device well deserving to be known,and due to the ingenuity of Facundus Novus, the mathematician.Upon the apex of the obelisk he placed a gildedball in order that the shadow of the summit might be con-<pb n="6335" />densed and agglomerated, and so prevent the shadow of theapex itself from running to a fine point of enormous extent;the plan being first suggested to him, it is said, by the shadowthat is projected by the human head. For nearly the lastthirty years, however, the observations derived from this dialhave been found not to agree: whether it is that the sunitself has changed its course in consequence of some derangementof the heavenly system; or whether that the wholeearth has been in some degree displaced from its centre, athing that, I have heard say, has been. remarked in other placesas well; or whether that some earthquake, confined to thiscity only, has wrenched the dial from its original position; orwhether it is that in consequence of the inundations of theTiber, the foundations of the mass have subsided, in spite ofthe general assertion that they are sunk as deep into the earthas the obelisk erected upon them is high.</p><p>(11.) The third<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> obelisk<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> at Rome is in the Vaticanian<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>Circus, which was constructed by the Emperors Caius<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> and Nero;this being the only one of them all that has been broken inthe carriage. Nuncoreus,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> the son of Sesoses, made it: andthere remains<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> another by him, one hundred cubits in height,which, by order of an oracle, he consecrated to the Sun, afterhaving lost his sight and recovered it.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">After being long buried in ruins, it was disinterred, but not re-erected,by Pope Benedict XIV. When thus brought to light, it was found to bebroken asunder.
