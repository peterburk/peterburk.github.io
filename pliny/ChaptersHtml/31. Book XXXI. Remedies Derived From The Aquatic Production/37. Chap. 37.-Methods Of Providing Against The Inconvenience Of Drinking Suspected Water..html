Fleeces are spread round the ship, and onbecoming moistened with the exhalations arising from the sea,the water is wrung from them, and found to be quite fresh.Hollow balls of wax, also, or empty vessels sealed at the mouth,upon being let down into the sea in a net, become filled withwater that is fresh and potable. On shore, too, sea-water maybe made fresh, by filtering it through argillaceous earth.</p><p>By swimming in water of any kind, sprains of the limbs inman or beast are reduced<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> with the greatest facility. Personswhen travelling, are sometimes apprehensive that the use ofwater, the quality of which is unknown to them, may proveinjurious to their health: as a precaution against this, theyshould drink the suspected water cold, immediately after leavingtie bath.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The joints being rendered more supple thereby.</p></body>
