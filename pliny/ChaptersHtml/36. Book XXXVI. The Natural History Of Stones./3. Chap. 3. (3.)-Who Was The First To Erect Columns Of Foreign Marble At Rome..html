<div2 type="chapter" n="3" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 3. (3.)â€”WHO WAS THE FIRST TO ERECT COLUMNS OFFOREIGN MARBLE AT ROME.</head><p>And yet it cannot be said that Scaurus, by way of a firstessay in vice, took the City by surprise, in a state of ignoranceand totally unguarded against such evils as these. Alreadyhad L. Crassus,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> the orator, he who was the first to possesspillars of foreign marble, and in this same Palatium too, receivedfrom M. Brutus, on the occasion of a dispute, the nicknameof the "Palatine Venus," for his indulgence in thiskind of luxury. The material, I should remark, was Hymettianmarble, and the pillars were but six in number, and notexceeding some twelve feet in height. Our forefathers wereguilty of this omission, no doubt, because morals were universallycontaminated; and, seeing that things which had been interdictedhad been forbidden in vain, they preferred the absenceof laws to laws that were no better than a dead letter. Theseparticulars and others in the sequel will show that we are sofar improved; for who is there at the present day that has, inhis atrium, any such massive columns as these of Scaurus?</p><p>But before proceeding to treat of the several varieties of thismaterial, it will be as well to mention the various artists, andthe degrees of estimation in which they are held, who haveworked in marble. We will, therefore, proceed to review thesculptors who have flourished at different periods.<pb n="6308" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xvii. c. 1.</p></body>
