Applied with egg it disperses all kinds of inflammation, those of the eyes in particular: it is employed also forhysterical suffocations, and for ulcerations of the stomach, chest,kidneys, liver, lungs, and bladder. It is particularly usefulalso in cases of inflammation of those parts, and for cough andpleurisy. It likewise removes itching<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> sensations, and acts asa diuretic. Persons who have used the precaution of firsttaking saffron in drink will never experience surfeit or headache, and will be proof against inebriation. Chaplets too,made of saffron, and worn on the head, tend to dispel the fumesof wine. The flower of it is employed topically with Cimolian<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> chalk for erysipelas. It is used also in the compositionof numerous other medicaments.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "prurigo."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxxv. cc. 18 and 57.</p></body>
