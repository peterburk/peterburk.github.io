The loligo,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> springing out of the water, shell-fishadhering to various objects, sea-urchins fastening by theirstickles upon the sand, or else burrowing in it, are so many in-<pb n="4124" />dications of stormy weather: the same, too, when frogs<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> croakmore than usual, or coots<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> make a chattering in the morning.Divers, too, and ducks, when they clean their feathers withthe bill, announce high winds; which is the case also when theaquatic birds unite in flocks, cranes make for the interior, anddivers<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> and sea-mews forsake the sea or the creeks. Craneswhen they fly aloft in silence announce fine weather, and sodoes the owlet,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> when it screeches during a shower; but itis heard in fine weather, it presages a storm. Ravens, too,when they croak with a sort of gurgling noise and shake theirfeathers, give warning of the approach of wind, if theirnote is continuous: but if, on the other hand, it is smothered,and only heard at broken intervals, we may expect rain, accompaniedwith high winds. Jackdaws, when they returnlate from feeding, give notice of stormy weather, and the samewith the white birds,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> when they unite in flocks, and theland birds, when they descend with cries to the water andbesprinkle themselves, the crow more particularly. Theswallow,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> too, when it skims along the surface of the water,so near as to ripple it every now and then with its wings, andthe birds that dwell in the trees, when they hide themselvesin their nests, afford similar indications; geese, too, whenthey set up a continuous gabbling,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> at an unusual time, andthe heron,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> when it stands moping in the middle of the sands.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Theophrastus, Cicero, and Plutarch state to a similar effect; and itis corroborated by the experience of most mariners.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The ink-fish; Sepia loligo of Linnæus. See B. ix. c. 21.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Virgil says the same, Georg. i. 378.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Fulicæ." See B. x. c. 61, and B. xi. c. 44.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Virgil says the same of the diver, or didapper,Georg. i. 361; and Lucan,Pharsalia, v. 553.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Both Theophrastus and Ælian mention this.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is not known what bird is here alluded to, but Fée is probablyright in suggesting a sort of sea-mew, or gull.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is still considered a prognostic of rain. Fée says thatthe swallow descends thus near to the surface to catch the insects onthe wing, which are now disabled from rising by the hygrometric stateof the atmosphere.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is confirmed by experience.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">On the contrary, Lucan says (Pharsalia, B. v. 1. 549), that on theapproach of rain, the heron soars in the upper regions of the air;and Virgil says the same, Georg. i. 364.</p></body>
