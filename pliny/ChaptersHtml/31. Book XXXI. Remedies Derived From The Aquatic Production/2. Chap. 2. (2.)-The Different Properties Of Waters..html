<div2 type="chapter" n="2" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 2. (2.)—THE DIFFERENT PROPERTIES OF WATERS.</head><p>On all sides, and in a thousand countries, there are watersbounteously springing forth from the earth, some of them cold,some hot, and some possessed of these properties united: thosein the territory of the Tarbelli,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> for instance, a people of Aquitania, and those among the Pyrencæan<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> Mountains, where hotand cold springs are separated by only the very smallest distance. Then, again, there are others that are tepid only, orlukewarm, announcing thereby the resources they afford forthe treatment of diseases, and bursting forth, for the benefit ofman alone, out of so many animated beings.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span></p><p>Under various names, too, they augment the number of thedivinities,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and give birth to cities; Puteoli,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> for example, inCampania, Statyellæ<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> in Liguria, and Sextiæ<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> in the provinceof Gallia Narbonensis. But nowhere do they abound in greaternumber, or offer a greater variety of medicinal properties thanin the Gulf of Baiæ;<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> some being impregnated with sulphur,some with alum, some with salt, some with nitre,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> and somewith bitumen, while others are of a mixed quality, partly acidand partly salt. In other cases, again, it is by their vapoursthat waters are so beneficial to man, being so intensely hot asto heat our baths even, and to make cold water boil in oursitting-baths; such, for instance, as the springs at Baiæ, nowknown as "Posidian," after the name of a freedman<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> of theEmperor Claudius; waters which are so hot as to cook articles<pb n="5473" />of food even. There are others, too,—those, for example,formerly the property of Licinius Crassus—which send forththeir vapours in the sea<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> even, thus providing resources for thehealth of man in the very midst of the waves!</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He alludes to the mineral waters of Acqs or Dax on the Adour, in theFrench department of the Ariège.
