<div2 type="chapter" n="28" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 28.—DIFFERENCES IN WATERS, ACCORDING TO THE NATUREOF THE SOIL.</head><p>The soil itself, too, gives indications of the presence of<pb n="5490" />water, by presenting white spots, or an uniformly green appearance: for where the stratum is black the springs are mostlynot of a permanent nature. The presence of potter's clayalways puts an end to all hopes of finding water, and the excavation is immediately abandoned; an eye being carefullykept to the strata<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> of the earth, to see whether, beginningwith black mould, it successively presents the appearancesabove-mentioned. The water is always fresh that is foundin argillaceous soils, but in a stratum of tufa it is colder thanelsewhere; this, indeed, being a soil which is highly approvedof, as having a tendency to make the water pure and extremelylight to the stomach, and, by its action as a filter, to withholdall impurities. The presence of sand<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> gives indications ofsprings of but limited extent, and of water impregnated withslime; while that of gravel announces the presence of water ofexcellent flavour, but not to be depended upon for permanence.Male:<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> sand, fine sea<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>-sand, and charcoal<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> earth, yield a constant supply of water of a highly wholesome quality; but itis the presence of red stones that is the most to be dependedupon, and the water found there is of the very finest quality.Craggy localities at the foot of mountains, and silicious soils,are equally good; in addition to which, the water found thereis cooler than elsewhere.</p><p>In boring for water, the soil should always become moreand more humid, and, the deeper the descent, with the greaterfacility the implements should penetrate. In deep-sunk wells,the presence of sulphureous<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> or aluminous substances is fatalto the sinkers; a danger that may be guarded against by lettingdown a lighted lamp, and ascertaining whether the flame isextinguished. When such is found to be the case, it is thepractice to sink vent-holes on each side of the well, both rightand left, in order to receive and carry off the noxious exhalations. Independently of these evils, the air becomes heavier,from the great depth merely of the excavation, an inconveniencewhich is remedied by keeping up a continual circulation withventilators of linen cloth. As soon as water is reached, walls<pb n="5491" />are constructed at the bottom, but without cement,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> in orderthat the springs may not be intercepted.</p><p>Some waters, the sources of which do not lie on elevatedground, are coldest at the beginning of spring, being maintained by the winter rains in fact. Others, again, are coldest atthe rising of the Dog-star—peculiarities, both of them, to bewitnessed at Pella in Macedonia; for in front of that city thereis a marsh-spring, which at the beginning of summer is cold,while in the more elevated parts of the city the water is ice-cold<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> in the hottest days of summer. The same is the case,too, at Chios, the water-supply of the harbour and of thecity occupying the same relative positions. At Athens, thewater of the Fountain Enneacrunos<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> is colder in a cloudysummer than the well there in the garden of Jupiter; whileon the other hand, this last is ice-cold during the drought of ahot summer. For the most part, however, wells are coldestabout the rising of Arcturus.<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span></p><p>(4.) The water-supply of wells never fails in summer, butin all cases it falls low during four days at the rising of theconstellation above-mentioned. Throughout the whole winter,on the other hand, many wells entirely fail; as in the neighbourhood of Olynthus, for example, where the water returnsin the early days of spring. In Sicily too, in the vicinity ofMessana and Mylæ, the springs are entirely dry throughoutthe winter, while in summer they overflow and form quite ariver. At Apollonia in Pontus there is to be seen, near thesea-shore, a fountain which overflows in summer only, andmostly about the rising of the Dog-star; should the summer,however, not be so hot as usual, its water is less abundant.Certain soils become drier in consequence of rain, that in theterritory of Narnia for example: a fact which M. Cicero hasmentioned in his "Admiranda," with a statement that droughtis there productive of mud, and rain of dust.<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Coria."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Sabulum."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Sabulum masculum."
