<div2 type="chapter" n="9" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 9.—PLACES WHERE DOLPHINS HELP MEN TO FISH.</head><p>There is in the province of Gallia Narbonensis and in theterritory of Nemausus<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> a lake known by the name of Latera,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> where dolphins fish in company with men. At the<pb n="2375" />narrow outlet<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> of this lake, at stated seasons of the year innumerable multitudes of mullets make their way into the sea,taking advantage of the turn of the tide; hence it is that it isquite impossible to employ nets sufficiently strong to bear sovast a weight, even though the fish had not the instinctiveshrewdness to watch their opportunity. By a similar instinctthe fish immediately make with all speed towards the deepwater which is found in a gulf in that vicinity, and hasten toescape from the only spot that is at all convenient for spreading the nets. As soon as ever the fishermen perceive this, allthe people—for great multitudes resort thither, being wellaware of the proper time, and especially desirous of sharingin the amusement—shout as loud as they can, and summonSimo to the scene of action. The dolphins very quickly understand that they are in requisition, as a north-east wind speedilycarries the sound to their retreats, though a south one wouldsomewhat retard it by carrying it in an opposite direction.Even then however, sooner than you could have possibly supposed, there are the dolphins, in all readiness to assist. Theyare seen approaching in all haste in battle array, and, imme-diately taking up their position when the engagement is aboutto take place, they cut off all escape to the open sea, and drivethe terrified fish into shallow water. The fishermen then throwtheir nets, holding them up at the sides with forks, though themullets with inconceivable agility instantly leap over them;<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span><pb n="2376" />while the dolphins, on the other hand, are waiting in readinessto receive them, and content themselves for the present withkilling them only, postponing all thoughts of eating till afterthey have secured the victory. The battle waxes hot apace,and the dolphins, pressing on with the greatest vigour,readily allow themselves to be enclosed in the nets; but inorder that the fact of their being thus enclosed may not urgethe enemy to find additional means of flight, they glidealong so stealthily among the boats and nets, or else the swimmers, as not to leave them any opening for escape. By leaping,which at other times is their most favourite amusement, notone among them attempts to make its escape, unless, indeed,the nets are purposely lowered for it; and the instant that ithas come out it continues the battle, as it were, up to the veryramparts. At last, when the capture is now completed, theydevour those among the fish which they have killed;<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> butbeing well aware that they have given too active an assistanceto be repaid with only one day's reward, they take care to waitthere till the following day, when they are filled not only withfish, but bread crumbs soaked in wine as well.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Nismes. See B. iii. c. 5.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Still known as the Lake of Lattes, in the department of Narbonne.Cuvier says that the mullet-fishing is still carried on in this lake, which is on the shores of Languedoc, and refers to D'Astruc's Memoirs on the Natural History of that province. The dolphins, however, he says, no longertake part in the sport; and he observes that the same story is told byÆlian, B. ii. c. 8, and Albertus Magnus, De Anim. B. xxiv., with referenceto other places. Oppian, in his Halieutica, B. v., makes Eubœa the sceneof these adventures, while Albertus Magnus speaks of the shores of Italy.Rondelet, in his Book on Fishes, says that it used to take place on thecoasts of Spain, near Palamos. Cuvier suggests, with Belon and D'Astruc,that the story arose from the fact that the dolphins, while pursuing theshoals of mullets, sometimes drove them into the creeks and salt-water lakeson the coast; a fact which has been sometimes found to cause the fish tobe caught in greater abundance.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Dalechamps tells us that the people of Montpellier call this outlet"La Crau," and that it is in the vicinity of Mangueil.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Were it not for the word "nihilominus" here, it would look as if themeaning were, that although the ends of the nets are hoisted up, the fishare so active that they jump over the side, and thus get enclosed. By theuse of that word, however, it would seem to mean, that although the sidesare hoisted up, the fish are so nimble, that they clear the nets altogether.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Quos interemere." Pintianus suggests "æquo interim jure"—"with equal rights," instead of these words, and Pelicier does not disapprove of the suggestion; for Ælian states, in B. ii. c. 8, Hist. Anim., thatthe dolphins used to share the fish equally with the fishermen of Eubœa.But, as Hardouin says, the words "quos interemere" have reference to thestatement above, that "they content themselves for the present with killingthem only." And besides, if the fishermen gave them an equal share, it isnot likely that they would give them still more of the fish on the followingday.</p></body>
