(10.)—THREE VARIETIES OF SECOND-RATE WINE.</head><p>Those cannot properly be termed wines, which by theGreeks are known under the name of "deuteria,"<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and towhich, in common with Cato, we in Italy give the name of"lora,"<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> being made from the husks of grapes steeped inwater. Still, however, this beverage is reckoned as makingone of the "labourers'"<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> wines. There are three varieties ofit: the first<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> is made in the following manner:—After themust is drawn off, one-tenth of its amount in water is addedto the husks, which are then left to soak a day and a night,and then are again subjected to pressure. A second kind,that which the Greeks are in the habit of making, is preparedby adding one-third in water of the quantity of must that hasbeen drawn off, and after submitting the pulp to pressure, theresult is reduced by boiling to one-third of its original quantity. A third kind, again, is pressed out from the wine-lees;Cato gives it the name of "fæcatum."<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> None of these beverages, however, will keep for more than a single year.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "second" press wines.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">De Re Rust. c. 153.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Vinum operarium.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This method is still adopted, Fée says, in making " piquette," orsmall wine," throughout most of the countries of Europe.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "wine-lee drink."
