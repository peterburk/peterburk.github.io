(9.)—OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN CUT OUT OF THE WOMB.</head><p>Those children, whose birth has cost the mother her life, areevidently born under more favourable auspices; for such wasthe case with the first Scipio Africanus; the first, too, of theCæsars was so named, from his having been removed by an incision in his mother's womb. For a similar reason, too, theCæsones were called by that name.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> Manilius, also, who entered Carthage with his army, was born in a similar manner.<pb n="2144" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From cædo, "to cut," apparently. The Cæsones were a branch ofthe Fabian family. There has been considerable difference of opinionamong the commentators respecting the individuals referred to in thisChapter. The subject is discussed at length in the Notes of Hardouin,Lemaire, vol. iii. p. 62.—B. So in Macbeth, act v. sc. 7, Macduff says toMacbeth—"And let the angel whom thou still hast serv'd,<lb />Tell thee, Macduff was from his mother's womb<lb />Untimely ripp'd."</p></body>
