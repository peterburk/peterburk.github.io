<div2 type="chapter" n="9" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 9. (12.)ÑAN ACCOUNT OF THE OBSERVATIONS THATHAVE BEEN MADE ON THE HEAVENS BY DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS.</head><p>The first among the Romans, who explained to the peopleat large the cause of the two kinds of eclipses, was SulpiciusGallus, who was consul along with Marcellus; and<pb n="1037" />when he was only a military tribune he relieved the armyfrom great anxiety the day before king Perseus was conquered byPaulus<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>; for he was brought by the general intoa public assembly, in order to predict the eclipse, of whichhe afterwards gave an account in a separate treatise. Amongthe Greeks, Thales the Milesian first investigated the subject, in the fourth year of the forty-eighth olympiad, predicting the eclipse of the sun which took place in the reignof Alyattes, in the 170th year of the City<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>. After them Hipparchus calculated the course of both these stars for the termof 600 years<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>, including the months, days, and hours, thesituation of the different places and the aspects adapted toeach of them; all this has been confirmed by experience,and could only be acquired by partaking, as it were, in thecouncils of nature. These were indeed great men, superiorto ordinary mortals, who having discovered the laws of thesedivine bodies, relieved the miserable mind of man from thefear which he had of eclipses, as foretelling some dreadful<pb n="1038" />events or the destruction of the stars. This alarm is freelyacknowledged in the sublime strains of Stesichorus and Pindar, as being produced by an eclipse of the sun<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>. And withrespect to the eclipse of the moon, mortals impute it towitchcraft, and therefore endeavour to aid her by producingdiscordant sounds. In consequence of this kind of terror itwas that Nicias, the general of the Athenians, being ignorantof the cause, was afraid to lead out the fleet, and broughtgreat distress on his troops<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>. Hail to your genius, ye interpretersof heaven! ye who comprehend the nature ofthings, and who have discovered a mode of reasoning bywhich ye have conquered both gods and men<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>! For who isthere, in observing these things and seeing the labours<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>which the stars are compelled to undergo (since we havechosen to apply this term to them), that would not cheerfully submitto his fate, as one born to die? I shall now,in a brief and summary manner, touch on those points inwhich we are agreed, giving the reasons where it is necessaryto do so; for this is not a work of profound argument, noris it less wonderful to be able to suggest a probable cause foreverything, than to give a complete account of a few ofthem only.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This eclipse is calculated to have occurred on the 28th of June, <date value="-168" authname="-168">168</date>B.C.; Brewster's Encyc. "Chronology," p. 415, 424. We have an accountof this transaction in Livy, xliv. 37, and in Plutarch, Life of Paulus®milius, Langhorne's trans. ii. 279; he however does not mention thename of Gallus. See also Val. Maximus, viii. 11. 1, and Quintilian, i.10. Val. Maximus does not say that Gallus predicted the eclipse, butexplained the cause of it when it had occurred; and the same statementis made by Cicero, De Repub. i. 15. For an account of Sulpicius, seeHardouin's Index auctorum, Lemaire, i. 214.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">An account of this event is given by Herodotus, Clio, ¤ 74.

He made acatalogue of thefixed stars, which is preserved in Ptolemy's Magn. Const. The onlywork of his now extant is his commentary on Aratus; it is contained inPetau's Uranologie. We find, among the ancients, many traces of theiracquaintance with the period of 600 years, or what is termed the greatyear, when the solar and lunar phenomena recur precisely at the samepoints. Cassini, Mem. Acad., and Bailly, Hist. Anc. Astron., have shownthat there is an actual foundation for this opinion.
