The best kind is that ofScythia,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> the next best being the produce of Cyprus, and, lastof all, that of Egypt. An artificial<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> kind is much in use,that is prepared by dyeing other substances; and this inventionis looked upon as one of the great glories of the kingsof Egypt, the name of the king who first discovered it beingstill preserved in their annals. This stone, too, is divided intomale and female, and sometimes it has the appearance of beingpowdered with a golden dust, in much the same way as sapphiros.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Azure stone;" generally supposed to have been a species of Lapislazuli or azure.
