(1.)ÑWHEN THE WAILD PLANTS WERE FIRST BROUGHTINTO USE.</head><p>THE more highly esteemed plants of which I am now aboutto speak, and which are produced by the earth for medicinalpurposes solely, inspire me with admiration of the industryand laborious research displayed by the ancients. Indeed thereis nothing that they have not tested by experiment or leftuntried; no discovery of theirs which they have not disclosed,or which they have not been desirous to leave for the benefitof posterity. We, on the contrary, at the present day, makeit our object to conceal and suppress the results of our labours,and to defraud our fellow-men of blessings even which havebeen purchased by others. For true it is, beyond all doubt,that those who have gained any trifling accession of knowledge,keep it to themselves, and envy the enjoyment of it by others; toleave mankind uninstructed being looked upon as the high prerogative of learning. So far is it from being the habit with themto enter upon new fields of discovery, with the view of benefitting mankind at large, that for this long time past it has beenthe greatest effort of the ingenuity of each, to keep to himselfthe successful results of the experience of former ages, and sobury them for ever!</p><p>And. yet, by Hercules! a single invention before now haselevated men to the rank of gods; and how many an individualhas had his name immortalized in being bestowed upon someplant which he was the first to discover, thanks to thegratitude which prompted a succeeding age to make someadequate return! If it had been expended solely upon theplants which are grown to please the eye, or which inviteus by their nutrimental properties, this laborious research onthe part of the ancients would not have been so surprising;but in addition to this, we find them climbing by devioustracts to the very summit of mountains, penetrating to the very<pb n="5078" />heart of wilds and deserts, and searching into every vein andfibre of the earth-and all this, to discover the hidden virtuesof every root, the properties of the leaf of every plant, and thevarious purposes to which they might be applied; convertingthereby those vegetable productions, which the very beasts ofthe field refuse to touch, into so many instruments for ourwelfare.</p></div2></body>
