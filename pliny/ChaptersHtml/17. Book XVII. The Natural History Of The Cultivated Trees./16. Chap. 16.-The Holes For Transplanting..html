<div2 type="chapter" n="16" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 16.—THE HOLES FOR TRANSPLANTING.</head><p>But it is more particularly necessary in transplanting, thatthe trees should always be removed to a soil that is similar, orelse superior,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> to the one in which they grew before. If takenfrom warm or early ripening localities, they ought not to be re-moved to cold or backward sites, nor yet, on the other hand, fromthese last to the former. If the thing can possibly be done,the holes for transplanting should be dug sufficiently long before to admit of their being covered throughout with a thick coatof grass. Mago recommends that they should be dug a whole<pb n="3469" />year beforehand, in order that they may absorb the heat ofthe sun and the moisture of the showers; or, if circumstancesdo not admit of this, that fires should be made in the middleof them some two months before transplanting, that being onlydone just after rain has fallen. He says, too, that in an argillaceous<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> or a hard soil, the proper measurement is three cubitsevery way, and on declivitous spots one palm more, care beingtaken in every case to make the hole like the chimney of afurnace, narrower at the orifice than at the bottom. Wherethe earth is black, the depth should be two cubits and a palm,and the hole dug in a quadrangular form.</p><p>The Greek writers agree in pointing out much the sameproportions, and are of opinion that the holes ought not to bemore than two feet and a half in depth, or more than two feetwide: at the same time, too, they should never be less thana foot and a half in depth, even though the soil should be wet,and the vicinity of water preclude the possibility of the soilgoing any deeper. "If the soil is watery," says Cato,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> "thehole should be three feet in width at the orifice, and one palmand a foot at the bottom, and the depth four feet. It shouldbe paved, too, with stones,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> or, if they are not at hand, withstakes of green willow, or, if these cannot be procured, with alayer of twigs; the depth of the layer so made being a footand a half."</p><p>It appears to me that I ought here to add, after what hasbeen said with reference to the nature of trees, that the holesshould be sunk deeper for those which have a tendency to runnear the surface of the earth, such as the ash and the olive,for instance. These trees, in fact, and others of a similarnature, should be planted at a depth of four feet, while for theothers three feet will be quite sufficient. "Cut down thatstump," said Papirius Cursor, the general,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> when to the great<pb n="3470" />terror of the prætor of Præneste, he had ordered the lictors todraw<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> their axes. And, indeed, there is no harm in cuttingaway those portions [of the root] which have become exposed.Some persons recommend that a bed should be formed at thebottom, of potsherds or round pebbles,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> which both allow themoisture to pass and retain as much as is wanted; while atthe same time they are of opinion that flat stones are of no usein such a case, and only prevent the root from penetrating<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>the earth. To line the bottom with a layer of gravel would beto follow a middle course between the two opinions.</p><p>Some persons recommend that a tree should not be transplanted before it is two years old, nor yet after three, whileothers, again, are of opinion that if it is one year old it isquite sufficient; Cato<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> thinks that it ought to be more thanfive fingers in thickness at the time. The same author, too,would not have omitted, if it had been of any importance, torecommend that a mark<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> should be made on the bark for thepurpose of pointing out the southern aspect of the tree; sothat, when transplanted, it may occupy exactly the same posi-tion that it has previously done; from an apprehension thatthe north side of the tree, on finding itself opposite to a southern sun, might split, and the south side be nipped by thenorth-eastern blasts. Indeed, there are some persons whofollow a directly opposite practice even in the vine and the fig,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>by placing the north side of the tree, when transplanted, towards the south, and vice versa; being, of opinion that by<pb n="3471" />adopting this plan the foliage becomes all the thicker<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> and thebetter able to protect the fruit, which is less liable to fall off inconsequence, and that the tree is rendered all the better forclimbing. Most people, however, take the greatest care to turnto the south that part of the tree from which the branches havebeen lopped at the top, little thinking that they expose itthereby to a chance of splitting<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> from the excessive heat. Formy own part, I should prefer that this part of the tree shouldface that point of the heavens which is occupied by the sun atthe fifth<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> or even the eighth hour of the day. People are alsoequally unaware that they ought not, through neglect, to letthe roots be exposed to the air long enough to get dry; andthat the ground should not be worked about the roots of treeswhile the wind is blowing from the north, or, indeed, fromany point of the heavens that lies between north and southeast; or, at all events, that the roots should not be left to lieexposed to these winds; the result of such modes of proceedingbeing, that the trees die, the grower being all the while intotal ignorance of the cause.</p><p>Cato<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> disapproves, too, of all wind and rain whenever thework of transplanting is going on. When this is the case, itwill be beneficial to let as much adhere to the roots as possibleof the earth in which the tree has grown, and to cover themall round with clods<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> of earth: it is for this reason that Cato<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span>recommends that the young trees should be conveyed in baskets,a very desirable method, no doubt. The same writer, too, approves of the earth that has been taken from the surface beinglaid at the bottom of the hole. Some persons say,<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> that if alayer of stones is placed beneath the root of the pomegranate,the fruit will not split while upon the tree. In transplanting, it<pb n="3472" />is the best plan to give the roots a bent position, but it is absolutely necessary that the tree should be placed in such a manneras to occupy exactly the centre of the hole. The fig-tree,it the slip when planted is stuck in a squill<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span>—such being thename of a species of bulb—is said to bear with remarkablerapidity, while the fruit is exempt from all attacks of theworm: the same precaution, too, in planting, will preservethe fruit of all other trees in a similar manner. Who isthere, too, that can entertain a doubt that the very greatestcare ought to be taken of the roots of the fig-tree when transplanted?—indeed, it ought to bear every mark of being taken,and not torn, from out of the earth. Upon this subject I omitvarious other practical precepts, such, for instance, as the necessity of moulding up the roots with a rammer, a thing thatCato<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> looks upon as of primary importance; while, at thesame time, he recommends that the wound made in the stockshould be first covered with dung, and then bound with alayer of leaves.<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is the reason why a soil of only middling quality is generallyselected for nurseries and seed-plots; otherwise it might be difficult totransplant the young trees to an improved soil.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The ordinary depth, at the present day, is about two feet; but whenin an argillaceous soil, as Pliny says, the hole is made deeper. If the soii.is black mould, the hole is not so deep, and of a square form, just as recom-mended by Pliny.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">De Re Rust. 43.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This would be either useless, or positively injurious to the tree.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xiv. c. 14. It seems impossible to say with exactness howthis passage came to be inserted in the context; but Sillig is probably rightin suspecting that there is a considerable lacuna here. It is not improbablethat Pliny may have enlarged upon the depth of the roots of trees, and themethod of removing them in ancient times. Such being the case, he mightthink it not inappropriate to introduce the story of Papirius, who, whenonly intending to have a stump cut down that grew in the way, took theopportunity of frightening the prætor of Præncste, by the suddenness ofthe order to his lictor, and probably the peremptory tone in which it wasgiven. This was all the more serious to the prætor, as Papirius had beenrebuking him just before in the severest terms.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From the bundle of fasces, or rods.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This precept is borrowed from Virgil, Georg. ii. 348, <hi rend="ital">et seq.</hi></p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There is little doubt that they took the right view.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">De Re Rust. 28.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This precaution is omitted by the modern nurserymen, though Fée isinclined to think it might be attended with considerable advantage, as thefibres of the side that has faced the south are not likely to be so firm asthose of the northern side. This precaution, however, would be of moreimportance with exotic trees than indigenous ones. It is still practised tosome extent with the layers of the vine.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Fée suggests that Pliny may have here misunderstood a passage inTheophrastus, Hist.

This expression shows that Pliny does not give creditto the statement.
