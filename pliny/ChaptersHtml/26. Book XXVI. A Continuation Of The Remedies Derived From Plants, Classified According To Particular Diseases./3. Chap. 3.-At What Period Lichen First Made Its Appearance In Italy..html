Thedisease, however, did not attack either females or slaves,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>nor yet the lower orders, or, indeed, the middle classes, butonly the nobles, being communicated even by the momentarycontact requisite for the act of salutation.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> Many of thosewho persevered in undergoing a course of remedial treatment,though cured of the disease, retained scars upon the body morehideous even than the malady itself; it being treated withcauteries, as it was certain to break out afresh, unless meanswere adopted for burning it out of the body by cauterizing tothe very bone.</p><p>Upon this occasion several physicians repaired to Romefrom Egypt, that fruitful parent of maladies of this nature,men who devoted themselves solely to this branch of medicalpractice; and very considerable were the profits they made.At all events, it is a well-known fact that Manilius Cornutus,a personage of prætorian rank, and legatus of the province ofAquitania, expended no less a sum than two hundred thousand<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> sesterces upon his cure.</p><p>It is much more frequently, on the other hand, that we hearof new forms of diseases attacking the lower orders; a singularfact, and one quite unequalled for the marvellous phænomenawhich sometimes attend these outbreaks. Thus, for instance,we find an epidemic suddenly making its appearance in a certain country, and then confining itself, as though it had madeits election so to do, to certain parts of the body, certain ages,and even certain pursuits in life. In the same way, too, while<pb n="5154" />one class of diseases attacks the young, another confines itselfto adults; while one malady extends itself only to the higherclasses, another is felt exclusively by the poor.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Meaning the people of Italy.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is somewhat difficult to say whether Tiberius, the predecessor, orClaudius, the successor of Caligula, is meant; most probably the latter,as the former's reign would have been in the times of "our fathers."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Asia Minor.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Cum apparuisset."
