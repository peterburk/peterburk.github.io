The other kind is more esteemed forits powerful odour. The small cedar produces a fruit the sizeof a grain of myrrh, and of a sweetish taste. There are twokinds of the larger cedar<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> also; the one that blossoms bears<pb n="3179" />no fruit, while, on the other hand, the one that bears fruit hasno blossom, and the fruit, as it falls, is being continually replacedby fresh. The seed of this tree is similar to that of the cypress. Some persons give this tree the name of "cedrelates."The resin produced from it is very highly praised, and thewood of it lasts for ever, for which reason it is that they havelong been in the habit of using it for making the statues of thegods. In a temple at Rome there is a statue of Apollo Sosianus<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> in cedar, originally brought from Seleucia. There is atree similar to the cedar, found also in Arcadia; and there isa shrub that grows in Phrygia, known as the "cedrus."</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Juniperus communis of Linnæus.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Juniperus Lycia, and the Juniperus Phœnicia, probably, of Lin-næus.
