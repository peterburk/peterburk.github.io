It is said that this plant is produced inEgypt also, and in Gaul as well, and I see no reason to doubtthat such is the fact, for this name is given to certain white<pb n="3146" />shaggy tufts upon trees, such as we often see upon the quercus:those, however, of which we are speaking, emit a most exquisite odour. The most esteemed of all are the whitest, andthose situate at the greatest height upon the tree. Those ofsecond quality are red, while those which are black are not ofthe slightest value. The sphagnos, too, that is produced onislands and among rocks,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> is held in no esteem, as well as allthose varieties which have the odour of the palm-tree, and notthat which is so peculiarly their own.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is clear that, under this name, certain lichens of a hairy or filamentary nature are meant. They adhere, Dioscorides tells us, to thecedar, the white poplar, and the oak. The white ones belong, probably,to the Usnea florida of Linnæus, the red ones to the Usuea barbata, andthe black ones to the Alectoria jubata, an almost inodoruus liohen.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably the Roccella tinctoria of Linnæus, a lichen most commonlyfound upon rocks.</p></body>
