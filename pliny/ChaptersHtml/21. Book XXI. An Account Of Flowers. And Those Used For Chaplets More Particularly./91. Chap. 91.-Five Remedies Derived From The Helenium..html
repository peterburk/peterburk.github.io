Besides this, it is generallysupposed that the use of it confers additional graces on theperson, and ensures universal attraction. They say, too, that,taken with wine, it promotes gaiety of spirit, having, in fact, asimilar effect to the nepenthes, which has been so much vauntedby Homer,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> as producing forgetfulness of all sorrow. Thejuice of this plant is remarkably sweet, and the root of it, takenfasting in water, is good for hardness of breathing; 'it is whitewithin, and sweet. An infusion of it is taken in wine for thestings of serpents; and the plant, bruised, it is said, will killmice.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In c. 33 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Od. iv. 1. 221. This has been supposed by many commentators tohave been opium. The origin of the word is <foreign lang="greek">nh/,</foreign> "not," and <foreign lang="greek">pe/nqos,</foreign>"grief;" and, as FŽe says, it would seem to indicate rather a compositionthan a plant. Saffron, mandragore, nightshade, and even tea and coffee,have been suggested by the active imaginations of various writers. FŽe isof opinion that it is impossible to come to any satisfactory conclusion, butinclines to the belief that either the poppy or a preparation from it, ismeant. In confirmation of this opinion, it is a singular fact, that, as Dr.Paris remarks (in his Pharmacologia), the Nepenthes of Homer was obtained from Thebes in Egypt, and that tincture of opium, or laudanum,has received the name of "Thebaic tincture." Gorr¾us, in his "Definitiones Medic¾," thinks that the herb alluded to is the Inula Campania,or Elecampane, which was also said to have derived its name of"Helenium" from Helen. Dr. Greenhill, in Smith's Dictionary of Antiquities, inclines to the opinion that it was opium. See the article"Pharmaceutica."</p></body>
