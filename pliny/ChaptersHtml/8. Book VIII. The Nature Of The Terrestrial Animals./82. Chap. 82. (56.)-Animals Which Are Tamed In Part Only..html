<div2 type="chapter" n="82" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 82. (56.)—ANIMALS WHICH ARE TAMED IN PART ONLY.</head><p>Hares are seldom tamed, and yet they cannot properly becalled wild animals; indeed, there are many species of themwhich are neither tame nor wild, but of a sort of intermediatenature; of the same kind there are among the winged animals,swallows and bees, and among the sea animals, the dolphin.</p><p>(57.) Many persons have placed that inhabitant of ourhouses, the mouse, in this class also; an animal which is notto be despised, for the portents which it has afforded, even inrelation to public events. By gnawing the silver shields atLanuvium,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> mice prognosticated the Marsian war; and thedeath of our general, Carbo, at Clusium,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> by gnawing thelatchets with which he fastened his shoes.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> There are manyspecies of this animal in the territory of Cyrenaica; some ofthem with a wide, others with a projecting, forehead, and someagain with bristling hair, like the hedgehog.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> We are informed by Theophrastus, that after the mice had driven theinhabitants of Gyara<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> from their island, they even gnawed theiron; which they also do, by a kind of natural instinct, in theiron forges among the Chalybes. In gold mines, too, their<pb n="2351" />stomachs are opened for this purpose, and some of the metal isalways to be found there, which they have pilfered,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> so greata delight do they take in stealing! We learn from our Annals,also, that at the siege of Casilinum,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> by Hannibal, a mouse wassold for two hundred denarii,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> and that the person who soldit perished with hunger, while the purchaser survived. Tobe visited by white mice is considered as indicative of a fortunate event; but our Annals are full of instances in which thesinging<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> of a mouse has interrupted the auspices.<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> Nigidiusinforms us, that the field-mouse conceals itself during winter:this is also said to be the case with the dormouse, which theregulations of the censors, and of M. Scaurus, the chief of thesenate, when he was consul,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> have banished from our tables,<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>no lebs than shell-fish and birds, which are brought from aforeign country. The dormouse is also a half-wild animal, andthe same person<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> made warrens for them in large casks, whofirst formed parks for wild boars. In relation to this subject,it has been remarked that dormice will not mate, unless theyhappen to be natives of the same forest; and that if those areput together that are brought from different rivers or mountains, they will fight and destroy each other. These animalsnourish their parents, when worn out with old age, with asingular degree of affection. This old age of theirs is put an<pb n="2352" />end to by their winter's rest, when they conceal themselvesand sleep; they are young again by the summer. The field-mouse<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> also enjoys a similar repose.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is referred to by Cicero, in his treatise, De Divinatione, B. i. c.44, and B. ii. c. 27; in the latter he treats it as an idle tale.—B.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. iii. c. 8.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">C.
