<div2 type="chapter" n="5" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 5. (7.)—OF GOD<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>.</head><p>I consider it, therefore, an indication of human weaknessto inquire into the figure and form of God. For whateverGod be, if there be any other God<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>, and wherever he exists, he isall sense, all sight, all hearing, all life, all mind<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>,and all within himself. To believe that there are a numberof Gods, derived from the virtues and vices of man<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, asChastity, Concord, Understanding, Hope, Honour, Clemency,<pb n="1021" />and Fidelity; or, according to the opinion of Democritus,that there are only two, Punishment and Reward<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>, indicatesstill greater folly. Human nature, weak and frail as it is,mindful of its own infirmity, has made these divisions, sothat every one might have recourse to that which he supposedhimself to stand more particularly in need of<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>. Hence wefind different names employed by different nations; theinferior deities are arranged in classes, and diseases andplagues are deified, in consequence of our anxious wish topropitiate them. It was from this cause that a temple wasdedicated to Fever, at the public expense, on the PalatineHill<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>, and to Orbona<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>, near the Temple of the Lares, andthat an altar was elected to Good Fortune on the Esquiline.Hence we may understand how it comes to pass that thereis a greater population of the Celestials than of human beings,since each individual makes a separate God for himself,adopting his own Juno and his own Genius<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>. And thereare nations who make Gods of certain animals, and evencertain obscene things<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>, which are not to be spoken of,swearing by stinking meats and such like. To supposethat marriages are contracted between the Gods, and that,during so long a period, there should have been no issue<pb n="1022" />from them, that some of them should be old and always grey-headed and others young and like children, some of a darkcomplexion, winged, lame, produced from eggs, living anddying on alternate days, is sufficiently puerile and foolish.But it is the height of impudence to imagine, that adulterytakes place between them, that they have contests andquarrels, and that there are Gods of theft and of variouscrimes<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>. To assist man is to be a God; this is the path toeternal glory. This is the path which the Roman noblesformerly pursued, and this is the path which is now pursuedby the greatest ruler of our age, Vespasian Augustus, hewho has come to the relief of an exhausted empire, as wellas by his sons. This was the ancient mode of remuneratingthose who deserved it, to regard them as Gods<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>. For thenames of all the Gods, as well as of the stars that I havementioned above<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>, have been derived from their services tomankind. And with respect to Jupiter and Mercury, andthe rest of the celestial nomenclature, who does not admitthat they have reference to certain natural phænomena<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>?But it is ridiculous to suppose, that the great head of allthings, whatever it be, pays any regard to human affairs<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>.<pb n="1023" />Can we believe, or rather can there be any doubt, that it isnot polluted by such a disagreeable and complicated office?It is not easy to determine which opinion would be mostfor the advantage of mankind, since we observe some whohave no respect for the Gods, and others who carry it to ascandalous excess. They are slaves to foreign ceremonies;they carry on their fingers the Gods and the monsters whomthey worship<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span>; they condemn and they lay great stress oncertain kinds of food; they impose on themselves dreadfulordinances, not even sleeping quietly. They do not marryor adopt children, or indeed do anything else, without thesanction of their sacred rites. There are others, on the contrary,who will cheat in the very Capitol, and will forswearthemselves even by Jupiter Tonans<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span>, and while these thrivein their crimes, the others torment themselves with theirsuperstitions to no purpose.</p><p>Among these discordant opinions mankind have discoveredfor themselves a kind of intermediate deity, by which ourscepticism concerning God is still increased. For all overthe world, in all places, and at all times, Fortune is the onlygod whom every one invokes; she alone is spoken of, shealone is accused and is supposed to be guilty; she alone isin our thoughts, is praised and blamed, and is loaded withreproaches; wavering as she is, conceived by the generalityof mankind to be blind, wandering, inconstant, uncertain,variable, and often favouring the unworthy. To her are referred allour losses and all our gains, and in casting up theaccounts of mortals she alone balances the two pages of oursheet<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span>. We are so much in the power of chance, that changeitself is considered as a God, and the existence of God becomes doubtful.</p><p>But there are others who reject this principle and assignevents to the influence of the stars<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span>, and to the laws of our<pb n="1024" />nativity; they suppose that God, once for all, issues hisdecrees and never afterwards interferes. This opinion begins to gain ground, and both the learned and the unlearnedvulgar are falling into it. Hence we have the admonitionsof thunder, the warnings of oracles, the predictions of soothsayers, and things too trifling to be mentioned, as sneezingand stumbling with the feet reckoned among omens<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span>. Thelate Emperor Augustus<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> relates, that he put the left shoe onthe wrong foot, the day when he was near being assaultedby his soldiers<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span>. And such things as these so embarrassimprovident mortals, that among all of them this alone iscertain, that there is nothing certain, and that there is nothing more proud or more wretched than man. For otheranimals have no care but to provide for their subsistence,for which the spontaneous kindness of nature is all-sufficient; andthis one circumstance renders their lot moreespecially preferable, that they never think about glory, ormoney, or ambition, and, above all, that they never reflecton death.</p><p>The belief, however, that on these points the Gods superintend human affairs is useful to us, as well as that thepunishment of crimes, although sometimes tardy, from theDeity being occupied with such a mass of business, is neverentirely remitted, and that the human race was not madethe next in rank to himself, in order that they might be degraded like brutes. And indeed this constitutes the greatcomfort in this imperfect state of man, that even the Deity<pb n="1025" />cannot do everything. For he cannot procure death forhimself, even if he wished it, which, so numerous are theevils of life, has been granted to man as our chief good. Norcan he make mortals immortal, or recall to life those whoare dead; nor can he effect, that he who has once lived shallnot have lived, or that he who has enjoyed honours shall nothave enjoyed them; nor has he any influence over pastevents but to cause them to be forgotten. And, if we illustrate the nature of our connexion with God by a less seriousargument, he cannot make twice ten not to be twenty, andmany other things of this kind. By these considerations thepower of Nature is clearly proved, and is shown to be whatwe call God. It is not foreign to the subject to have digressed into these matters, familiar as they are to every one,from the continual discussions that take place respectingGod<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span>.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is remarked by <placeName key="tgn,7014117" authname="tgn,7014117">Enfield</placeName>, Hist. of <placeName key="tgn,2578489" authname="tgn,2578489">Phil</placeName>. ii. 131, that "with respectto philosophical opinions, <placeName key="tgn,2588096" authname="tgn,2588096">Pliny</placeName> did not rigidly adhere to any sect....He reprobates the Epicurean tenet of an infinity of worlds; favours thePythagorean notion of the harmony of the spheres; speaks of the universeas God, after the manner of the Stoics, and sometimes seems to pass overinto the field of the Sceptics.
