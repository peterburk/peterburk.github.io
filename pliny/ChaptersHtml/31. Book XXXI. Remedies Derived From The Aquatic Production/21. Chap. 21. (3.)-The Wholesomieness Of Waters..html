<div2 type="chapter" n="21" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 21. (3.)—THE WHOLESOMIENESS OF WATERS.</head><p>It is a subject of enquiry among medical men, which kindof water is the most beneficial. They condemn, and withjustice, all stagnant, sluggish, waters, and are of opinion thatrunning water is the best, being rendered lighter and more<pb n="5483" />salubrious by its current and its continuous agitation. Hence itis that I am much surprised that persons should be found toset so high a value as they do, upon cistern water. These lastgive as their reason, however, that rain-water must be thelightest water of all, seeing that it has been able to rise<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> aloftand remain suspended in the air. Hence it is, too, that theyprefer snow-water to rain-water, and ice, again, to snow, asbeing water subtilized to the highest possible degree; on theground that snow-water and ice-water must be lighter thinordinary water, and ice, of necessity, considerably lighter. Itis for the general interest, however, of mankind, that thesenotions should be refuted. For, in the first place, this comparative lightness which they speak of, could hardly be ascertained in any other way than by the sensation, there beingpretty nearly no difference at all in weight between the kinds ofwater. Nor yet, in the case of rain-water, is it any proof ofits lightness that it has made its way upwards into the air,seeing that stones,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> it is quite evident, do the same: and then.besides, this water, while falling, must of necessity becometainted with the vapours which rise from the earth; a circumstance owing to which it is, that such numerous impurities<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>are to be detected in rain-water, and that it ferments<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> withsuch extreme rapidity.</p><p>I am, surprised, too, that snow<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> and ice should be regardedas the most subtilized states of this element, in juxtapositionwith the proofs supplied us by hail, the water of which, it isgenerally agreed, is the most pernicious of all to drink. Andthen, besides, there are not a few among the medical menthemselves, who assert that the use of ice-water and snow-water is highly injurious, from the circumstance that all themore refined parts thereof have been expelled by congelation.At all events, it is a well-ascertained fact that the volume ofevery liquid is diminished by congelation; as also that exces-<pb n="5484" />sive dews<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> a reproductive of blight in corn, and that hoar-trosts result in blast; of a kindred nature, both of them, tosnow. It is generally agreed, too, that rain-water putrefieswith the greatest rapidity, and that it keeps but very badly ona voyage. Epigenes, however, assures us that water whichhas putrefied seven times and as often purified<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> itself, will nolonger be liable to putrefaction. As to cistern-water, medicalmen assure us that, owing to its harshness, it is bad for thebowels and throat:<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> and it is generally admitted by them that,there is no kind of water that contains more slime or morenumerous insects of a disgusting nature. But it does not,therefore, follow that river water is the best of all, or that, infact, of any running stream, the water of many lakes beingfound to be wholesome in the very highest degree.</p><p>What water, then, out of all these various kinds, are we tolook upon as best adapted for the human constitution? Different kinds in different localities, is my answer. The kingsof Parthia drink no water but that of the Choaspes<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> or of theEulæus, and, however long their journies, they always havethis water carried in their suite. And yet it is very evidentthat it is not merely because this water is river-water that itis thus pleasing to them, seeing that they decline to drink thewater of the Tigris, Euphrates, and so many other streams.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Rain-water really is the lightest, but the reason here given is frivolous,for it does not ascend as water, but as vapour.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. ii. c. 38.
