<div2 type="chapter" n="12" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 12. (6.)ÑCORSICA.</head><p>In the Ligurian Sea, but close to the Tuscan, is Corsica,by the Greeks called Cyrnos, extending, from north tosouth 150 miles, and for the most part 50 miles in breadth,its circumference being 325. It is 62 miles distant fromthe Vada Volaterrana<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>. It contains thirty-two states, andtwo colonies, that of Mariana<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>, founded by C. Marius, andthat of Aleria, founded by the Dictator Sylla. On thisside of it is Oglasa<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>, and, at a distance of less than sixtymiles from Corsica, Planaria<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, so called from its appearance, being nearly level with the sea, and consequentlytreacherous to mariners.</p><p>We next have Urgo<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>, a larger island, and Capraria, whichthe Greeks have called ®gilion<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>; then Igilium<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> and Dianium<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>, which they have also called Artemisia, both of themopposite the coast of Cosa; also Barpana<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>, M¾naria, Co-<pb n="1214" />lumbaria, and Venaria. We then come to Ilva<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> with its ironmines, an island 100 miles in circumference, 10 miles distantfrom Populonium, and called ®thalia by the Greeks: fromit the island of Planasia<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> is distant 28 miles. After these,beyond the mouths of the Tiber, and off the coast of Antium,we come to Astura<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>, then Palmaria and Sinonia, and, opposite to Formi¾, Ponti¾. In the Gulf of Puteoli are Pandateria<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>, and Prochyta, so called, not from the nurse of®neas, but because it has been poured forth<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> or detachedfrom ®naria<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>, an island which received its name from having been the anchorage of the fleet of ®neas, though calledby Homer Inarime<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span>; it is also called Pithecusa, not, asmany have fancied, on account of the multitudes of apesfound there, but from its extensive manufactories of pottery.Between Pausilipum<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> and Neapolis lies the island of Megaris<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span>, and then, at a distance of eight miles from Surrentum,Capre¾<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span>, famous for the castle of the emperor Tiberius: itis eleven miles in circumference.<pb n="1215" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In ancient Etruria, now Torre di Vada.

See Met. B. xiv. 1.89. As is here mentioned byPliny, many persons derived the name "Pithecus¾" from <foreign lang="greek">pi/qhkos</foreign> "anape," and, according to Strabo, "Aremus" was the Etrurian name for anape. Ovid, in the Metamorphoses, <hi rend="ital">loc. cit.,</hi> confirms this tradition byrelating the change of the natives into apes. The solution of its namegiven by Pliny appears however extremely probable, that it gained itsname from its manufacture of <foreign lang="greek">piqhka\,</foreign> or earthen vessels. Virgil is supposed to have coined the name of "Inarime."</p><p><span id="note_17"><a href="#ref_17">17. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Posilippo.
