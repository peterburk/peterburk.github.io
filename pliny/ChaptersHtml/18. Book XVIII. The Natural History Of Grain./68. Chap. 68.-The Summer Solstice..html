<div2 type="chapter" n="68" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 68.—THE SUMMER SOLSTICE.</head><p>We have already stated<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> that the summer solstice arrives atthe eighth degree of Cancer, and upon the eighth day before<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>the calends of July: this is an important crisis in the year,and of great interest to the whole earth. Up to this periodfrom the time of the winter solstice the days have gone onincreasing, and the sun has continued for six months makinghis ascension towards the north; having now surmounted theheights of the heavens, at this point he reaches the goal, and<pb n="4093" />after doing so, commences his return towards the south; theconsequence of which is, that for the next six months heincreases the nights and subtracts from the length of the days.From this period, then, it is the proper time to gather in andstore away the various crops in succession, and so make alldue preparations for the rigour and severity of the winter.</p><p>It was only to be expected that Nature should point out tous the moment of this change by certain signs of an indubitablecharacter; and she has accordingly placed them beneaththe very hands of the agriculturist, bidding the leaves turnround<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> upon that day, and so denote that the luminary has nowrun its course. And it is not the leaves of trees only that arewild and far remote that do this, nor have those persons whoare on the look-out for these signs to go into devious forestsand mountain tracts to seek them. Nor yet, on the otherhand, are they to be seen in the leaves of trees only that aregrown in the vicinity of cities or reared by the hand of theornamental gardener, although in them they are to be seenas well. Nature upon this occasion turns the leaf of theolive which meets us at every step; she turns the leaf ofthe linden, sought by us, as it is, for a thousand purposes;she turns the leaf of the white poplar, too, wedded to the vinethat grows upon its trunk. And still, for her, all this is notenough. "You have the elm," she says, "reared for the support of thevine, and the leaf of that I will make to turn aswell. The leaves of this tree you have to gather for fodder, theleaves of the vine you prune away. Only look upon them,and there you behold the solstice;<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> they are now pointingtowards a quarter of the heavens the reverse of that towardswhich they looked the day before. The twigs of the withy,that most lowly of trees, you employ for tying things withoutnumber. You are a head taller than it—I will make itsleaves to turn round as well. Why complain, then, that youare but a rustic peasant? It shall be no fault of mine ifyou do not understand the heavens and become acquaintedwith the movements of the celestial bodies. I will giveanother sign, too, that shall address itself to your ear—onlylisten for the cooing of the ring-doves; and beware of sup-<pb n="4094" />posing that the summer solstice is past, until you see thewood-pigeon sitting on her eggs."</p><p>Between the summer solstice and the setting of the Lyre, onthe sixth day before the calends of July,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> according to Cæsar'sreckoning, Orion rises, and upon the fourth<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> before the nonesof July, his Belt rises to the people of Assyria. Upon-themorning of the same day, also, the scorching constellation ofProcyon rises. This last constellation has no name with theRomans, unless, indeed, we would consider it as identical withCanicula,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> or Lesser Dog, which we find depicted amongthe stars; this last is productive of excessive heat, as we shallshortly have further occasion to state. On the fourth<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> beforethe nones of July, the Crown sets in the morning to the peopleof Chaldæa, and in Attica, the whole of Orion has risen bythat day. On the day before<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> the ides of July, the rising ofOrion ends to the Egyptians also; on the sixteenth<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> beforethe calends of August, Procyon rises to the people of Assyria,and, the day but one after, of nearly all other countries as well,indicating a crisis that is universally known among all nations,and which by us is called the rising of the Dog-star; the sunat this period entering the first degree of Leo. The Dog-starrises on the twenty-third day after the summer solstice; theinfluence of it is felt by both ocean, and earth, and even by manyof the animals as well, as stated by us elsewhere on the appropriateoccasions.<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> No less veneration, in fact, is paid to thisstar, than to those that are consecrated to certain gods; itkindles the flames of the sun, and is one great source of theheats of summer.</p><p>On the thirteenth<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> day before the calends of August, theEagle sets in the morning to the people of Egypt, and thebreezes that are the precursors of the Etesian winds, begin toblow; these, according to Cæsar, are first perceived in Italy,on the tenth before<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> the calends of August. The Eagle setsin the morning of that day to the people of Attica, and on tile<pb n="4095" />third before<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> the calends of August, the Royal Star in thebreast of Leo rises in the morning, according to Cæsar. Onthe eighth before<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> the ides of August, one half of Arcturushas ceased to be visible, and on the third before<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> the ides theLyre, by its setting, opens the autumn,—according to Cæsar atleast; though a more exact calculation has since shown, thatthis takes place on the sixth day before<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> the ides of that month.</p><p>The time that intervenes between these periods is one thatis of primary importance in the cultivation of the vine; asthe constellation of which we have spoken, under the name ofCanicula, has now to decide upon the fate of the grape. It isat this period that the grapes are said to be charred,<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> a blightfalling upon them which burns them away, as though red-hotcoals had been applied to them. There is no hail that can becompared with this destructive malady, nor yet any of thosetempests, which have been productive of such scarcity anddearth. For the evil effects of these, at the very utmost, areonly felt in isolated districts, while the coal blight,<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> on the otherhand, extends over whole countries, far and wide. Still, however, theremedy would not be very difficult, were it not thatmen would much rather calumniate Nature, than help themselves. It issaid that Democritus,<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> who was the first to comprehend anddemonstrate that close affinity which exists between the heavens andthe earth, finding his laborious researches upon thatsubject slighted by the more opulent of hisfellow-citizens, and presaging the high price of oil, which wasabout to result upon the rising of the Vergiliæ, (as we havealready mentioned,<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> and shall have to explain more fullyhereafter), bought up all the oil in the country, which was then ata very low figure, from the universal expectation of a fine cropof olives; a proceeding which greatly surprised all who knewtlat a life of poverty and learned repose was so entirely theobject of his aspirations. When, however, his motives hadbeen fully justified by the result, and vast riches had flowed inupon him apace, he returned all his profits to the disappointed<pb n="4096" />proprietors, whose avarice had now taught them to repent,thinking it quite sufficient to have thus proved how easy itwas for him to acquire riches whenever he pleased. At amore recent period, again, Sextius,<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> a Roman philosopher residingat Athens, made a similar application of his knowledge.Such, then, is the utility of science, the instruction providedby which it shall be my aim, as clearly and as perspicuouslyas possible, to apply to the various occupations of a countrylife.</p><p>Most writers have said that it is the dew, scorched by aburning sun, that is the cause of mildew<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span> in corn, and ofcoal-blight in the vine; this, however, seems to me in a greatmeasure incorrect, and it is my opinion that all blights resultentirely from cold, and that the sun is productive of no injuriouseffects whatever. This, in fact, will be quite evident, if only alittle attention is paid to the subject; for we find that the blightmakes its appearance at first in the night time only, and beforethe sun has shone with any vigour. The natural inference is,that it depends entirely upon the moon, and more particularlyas such a calamity as this is never known to happen except at themoon's conjunction, or else at the full moon, periods at whichthe influence of that heavenly body is at its greatest height.For at both of these periods, as already<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span> stated by us morethan once, the moon is in reality at the full; though duringher conjunction she throws back to the heavens all the lightwhich she has received from the sun. The difference in theeffects produced by the moon at these two periods is very great,though at the same time equally apparent; for at the conjunction,that body is extremely hot in summer, but cold in winter; while, onthe other hand, at the full moon, the nights arecold in summer, but warm in winter. The reason of this.although Fabianus and the Greek writers adopt another method of explaining it, is quite evident. During the moon'sconjunction in summer, she must of necessity move along withthe sun in an orbit nearer to the earth, and so become warmed<pb n="4097" />by the heat which she receives by reason of her closer vicinityto the sun. In winter, again, at the time of the conjunction,she is farther off from us, the sun being also removed to agreater distance. On the other hand, again, when the moonis at the full in summer, she is more remote from the earth,and in opposition with the sun; while, in winter, she approachesnearer to us at that period, by adopting the sameorbit as at her conjunction in summer. Naturally humid herself, asoften as from her position she is cold, she congeals toan unlimited extent the dews which fall at that period of theyear.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In c. 59 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Twenty-fourth of June.
