ed likes to write books. His home is near the C. 
ed has short black hair on his head, with a curl. 
ed has a cat with a long tail. His cat likes to read books. He likes it when you tcl his tummy. 
Last time, ed looked into the clear sky. It's a nice view. On top of the arch, he saw a bird. 
"Whatis your name?" asked ed. 
"Awk" said the bird. 
"Can you talk to a man?" asked ed. 
"Yes" said awk. "I read books. But only sum words."
"Can you find all the words that start with a B?" asked ed. 
"books" "black" "bird" "but" "bin" "big" "bits" "bash" sed awk. 
"That's right! You're very good at reading. Which place do you live in?" asked ed. 
"Now I live in a bin." said awk. 
Awk is hungry. 
To goto the field, he crawls through a pipe. 
He gets some food from the field, and puts it on the table to eat it with a fork. 
Yummy! He takes a byte. 
Oh no! Now he's too fat to go back home. 
"Don't worry", says ed. "I can sort that out."
"My cat will cut food from the field and keep on sending it through the pipe for you."
"Now I need to go to the toilet." says awk. 
They go to the toilet. Wait while IP, says ed. 
Awk sits down and unzips his trousers. 
awk does one poo, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight! 
The wc has 8 bits of poo. There's a big login the heap. Stinky! 
Flush! The poo goes away through another pipe. 
The awk must wash his hands. But the sink is grotty and it leaks. 
ed has strong arms. He can flex his muscles. "I'll make it better with tar!" he says. 
With a bash and a clang, the sink is flowing again. 
"Eat less next time." says ed. "The only animal who eats more than you is the GNU."
"I was hungry!" says awk. "What did you expect?"
It's time to leave. There's no reason to stay here idle. "Welcome back to our group any time. cu later!"

I managed to get 60 UNIX words into the (350 word) story, which I think is pretty good going. 

ed, write, home, C, head, curl, cat, long, tail, read, tcl, last, time, clear, nice, view, top, arch, whatis, awk, man, yes, sum, find, sed, which, bin, goto, pipe, gets, field, table, sort, cut, send, for, wait, while, IP, unzip, wc, log, login, heap, more, sink, grotty, leaks, flex, make, tar, bash, clang, less, Gnu, expect, leave, idle, group, cu. 

P.S. There's a few more, but I think those would be a bit cheesy. 
float, strings, ex, python, ruby, java, git, svn, perl, class, ps, pico, nano

bytes, troff, shell, fish, enter, return, escape, space, control, option, word, lisp, thread, fork, backend, frontend, bc, yacc
