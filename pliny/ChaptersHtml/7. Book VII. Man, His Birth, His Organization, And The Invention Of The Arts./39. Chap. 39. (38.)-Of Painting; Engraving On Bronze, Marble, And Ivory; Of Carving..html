King Candaules gave its weight in gold for a large picture by Bularchus,the subject of which was the destruction of the Magnetes.Demetrius, who was surnamed the "taker of cities,"<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> refused to<pb n="2185" />set fire to the city of Rhodes, lest he should chance to destroya picture of Protogenes, which was placed on that side of thewalls against which his attack was directed. Praxiteles<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> hasbeen ennobled by his works in marble, and more especially by hisCnidian Venus, which became remarkable from the insane lovewhich it inspired in a certain young man,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> and the high valueset upon it by King Nicomedes, who endeavoured to procure itfrom the Cnidians, by offering to pay for them a large debtwhich they owed. The Olympian Jupiter day by day bearstestimony to the talents of Phidias,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> and the Capitoline Jupiterand the Diana of Ephesus to those of Mentor;<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> to whichdeities, also, were consecrated vases made by this artist.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">According to the usual estimate of the value of the Attic talent,£193 12s., the sum given for this picture would be about £19,000.—B.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Nearly all the topics here treated of are again mentioned inB. xxxv., which is devoted to the fine arts. The 34th, 35th, and36th Chapters of that Book, contain an account of all the celebrated painters of antiquity, and their principal works.—B.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Between £15,000 and £16,000.—B.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Polioreetes."</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We have a further account of this artist in B. xxxiv. c. 19, B. xxxv.c. 39 and 40, and B. xxxvi. c. 4.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is referred to by Pliny, B. xxxvi. c. 4, and by Valerius Maximus,B. viii. c. 4.—B.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He is again mentioned in B. xxxiv. c. 19, B. xxxv. c. 34, and B.xxxvi. c. 4.—B.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Mentor is noticed for his skill in carving, B. xxxiii. c. 55.—B. Littré says, on referring to that passage, "we find that he was a worker in silver,and a maker of vases of great value." He seems disinclined to believe thathe was a statuary. As Pliny tells us, <hi rend="ital">ubi supra,</hi> none of his public workswere in existence in Pliny's time. Some small cups, however, existed,which were highly prized, though some were undoubtedly spurious.</p></body>
