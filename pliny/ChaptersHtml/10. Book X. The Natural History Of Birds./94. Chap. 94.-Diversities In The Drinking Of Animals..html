Those which have the teeth continuous, horses andoxen, for instance, sup; bears do neither the one nor the other,but seem to bite at the water, and so devour it. In Africa,the greater part of the wild beasts do not drink in summer,through the want of rain; for which reason it is that the miceof Libya, when caught, will die if they drink. The ever-thirsting plains of Africa produce the oryx,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> an animal which,in consequence of the nature of its native locality, neverdrinks, and which, in a remarkable manner, affords a remedyagainst drought: for the Gætulian bandits by its aid fortifythemselves against thirst, by finding in its body certainvesicles filled with a most wholesome liquid. In this sameAfrica, also, the pards conceal themselves in the thick foliageof the trees, and then spring down from the branches on anycreature that may happen to be passing by, thus occupyingwhat are ordinarily the haunts of the birds. Cats too, withwhat silent stealthiness, with what light steps do they creeptowards a bird! How slily they will sit and watch, and thendart out upon a mouse! These animals scratch up the earthand bury their ordure, being well aware that the smell of itwould betray their presence.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny alludes to dogs, cats, and similar mammifera, as having <hi rend="ital">serrated</hi>teeth; the term, however, is quite inappropriate.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. viii. c. 79.</p></body>
