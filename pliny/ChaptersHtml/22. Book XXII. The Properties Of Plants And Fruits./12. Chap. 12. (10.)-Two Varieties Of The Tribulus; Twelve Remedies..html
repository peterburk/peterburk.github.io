<div2 type="chapter" n="12" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 12. (10.)—TWO VARIETIES OF THE TRIBULUS; TWELVE REMEDIES.</head><p>Of the two<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> kinds of tribulus, the one is a garden plant,the other grows in rivers only. There is a juice extracted fromthem which is employed for diseases of the eyes, it being of acool and refreshing nature, and, consequently, useful for inflammations and abscesses. Used with honey, this juice iscurative of spontaneous ulcerations, those of the mouth in particular; it is good also for affections of the tonsils. Taken ina potion, it breaks calculi of the bladder.</p><p>The Thracians who dwell on the banks of the river Strymonfeed their horses<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> on the leaves of the tribulus, and employ thekernels as an article of food, making of them a very agreeablekind of bread, which acts astringently<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> upon the bowels. The<pb n="4401" />root, if gathered by persons in a state of chastity and purity,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>disperses scrofulous sores; and the seed, used as an amulet,allays the pains attendant upon varicose veins: pounded andmixed with water, it destroys fleas.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably the Fagonia Cretica and the Trapa natans of Linnæus. SeeB. xxi. c. 58. The first, Fée remarks, is a native of Candia, the ancientCrete, and a stranger to the climates of Greece and Italy. This may account for Pliny calling it a garden plant.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is said, Fée remarks, in reference to the Trapa natans, the seedof which is rich in fecula, and very nutritious.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Contrahat ventrem." It would not act, Fée says, as an astringent, but would have the effect of imparting nutriment in a very high degree,without overloading the stomach.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A harmless, or, perhaps, beneficial, superstition.</p></body>
