(15.)—-REMEDIES FOR AFFECTIONS OF THE BLADDER,AND FOR URINARY CALCULI.</head><p>Diseases of the bladder, and the torments attendant uponcalculi, are treated with the urine of a wild boar, or thebladder of that animal taken as food; both of them being stillmore efficacious if they have been thoroughly soaked first.The bladder, when eaten, should be boiled first, and if thepatient is a female, it should be a sow's bladder. There arefound in the liver of the wild boar certain small stones,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> orwhat in hardness resemble small stones, of a white hue, andresembling those found in the liver of the common swine: ifthese stones are pounded and taken in wine, they will expelcalculi, it is said. So oppressed is the wild boar by the burden of his urine,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> that if he has not first voided it, he isunable to take to flight, and suffers himself to be taken asthough he were enchained to the spot. This urine, they say,has a consuming effect upon urinary calculi. The kidneys ofa hare, dried and taken in wine, act as an expellent uponcalculi. We have already<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> mentioned that in the gammon ofthe hog there are certain joint-bones; a decoction made fromthem is remarkably useful for urinary affections. The kidneysof an ass, dried and pounded, and administered in undilutedwine, are a cure for diseases of the bladder. The excrescencesthat grow on horses' legs, taken for forty days in ordinarywine or honied wine, expel urinary calculi. The ashes, too, of<pb n="5350" />a horse's hoof, taken in wine or water, are considered highlyuseful for this purpose; and the same with the dung of a she-goat—if a wild goat, all the better—taken in honied wine:goats' hair, too, is used, reduced to ashes.</p><p>For carbuncles upon the generative organs, the brains andblood of a wild boar or swine are highly recommended: andfor serpiginous affections of those parts, the liver of thoseanimals is used, burnt upon juniper wood more particularly,and mixed with papyrus and arsenic;<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> the ashes, also, of theirdung; ox-gall, kneaded to the consistency of honey, withEgyptian alum and myrrh, beet-root boiled in wine being laidupon it; or else beef. Running ulcers of those parts aretreated with veal-suet and marrow, boiled in wine, or with thegall of a she-goat, mixed with honey and the extracted juiceof the bramble.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> In cases where these ulcers are serpiginous,it is recommended to use goats' dung with honey or vinegar,or else butter by itself. Swellings of the testes are reduced byusing veal-suet with nitre, or the dung of the animal boiled invinegar. The bladder of a wild boar, eaten roasted, acts as acheck upon incontinence of urine; a similar effect being produced by the ashes of the feet of a wild boar or swine sprinkledin the drink; the ashes of a sow's bladder taken in drink; thebladder or lights of a kid; a hare's brains taken in wine; thetestes of a male hare grilled; the rennet of that animal takenwith goose-grease and polenta;<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> or the kidneys of an ass, beatenup and taken in undiluted wine.</p><p>The magicians tell us, that after taking the ashes of a boar'sgenitals in sweet wine, the patient must make water in a dogkennel, and repeat the following formula—"This I do that Imay not wet my bed as a dog does." On the other hand, aswine's bladder, attached to the groin, facilitates the dischargeof the urine, provided it has not already touched the ground.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In reality, these are biliary calculi, found in the gall-bladder of theanimal.
