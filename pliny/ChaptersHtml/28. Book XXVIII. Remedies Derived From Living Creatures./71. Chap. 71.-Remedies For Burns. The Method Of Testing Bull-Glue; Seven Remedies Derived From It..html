THE METHOD OF TESTINGBULL-GLUE; SEVEN REMEDIES DERIVED FROM IT.</head><p>For the treatment of burns, bears' grease is used, with lilyroots; dried wild boars' dung also, or swine's dung; the ashesof burnt bristles, extracted from plasterers' brushes, beaten upwith grease; the pastern-bone of an ox, reduced to ashes, andmixed with wax and bull's marrow or deer's marrow; or thedung of a hare. The dung, too, of a she-goat, they say, willeffect a cure without leaving any scars.<pb n="5358" /></p><p>The best glue is that prepared from the ears and genitals ofthe bull, and there is no better cure in existence for burns.There is nothing, however, that is more extensively adulterated;which is done by boiling up all kinds of old skins, and shoeseven, for the purpose. The Rhodian glue is the purest of all,and it is this that painters and physicians mostly use. Thewhiter it is, the more highly glue is esteemed: that, on theother hand, which is black and brittle like wood, is looked uponis good for nothing.</p></div2></body>
