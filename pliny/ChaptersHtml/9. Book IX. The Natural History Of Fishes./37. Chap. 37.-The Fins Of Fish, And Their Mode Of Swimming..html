Those fishes which are long andslimy, have only two at most, such, for instance, as eels andcongers: others, again, have none, such as the muræna, whichis also without gills.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> All these fish<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> make their way in thesea by an undulatory motion of the body, just as serpents doon land; on dry land, also, they are able to crawl along, andhence those of this nature are more long-lived than the others.Some of the flat-fish, also, have no fins, the pastinacæ,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> for instance—for these swim broad-wise—those, also, which areknown as the "soft" fish, such as the polypi, for their feet <span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>serve them in stead of fins.<pb n="2409" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle, Hist.
