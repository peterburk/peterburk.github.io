(2.)—THE PHŒNIX.</head><p>Æthiopia and India, more especially, produce<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> birds of diversified plumage, and such as quite surpass all description. Inthe front rank of these is the phœnix,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> that famous bird of<pb n="2480" />Arabia; though I am not quite sure that its existence is notall a fable. It is said that there is only one in existence in thewhole world, and that that one has not been seen very often.We are told that this bird is of the size of an eagle,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> andhas a brilliant golden plumage around the neck, while the restof the body is of a purple colour; except the tail, which isazure, with long feathers intermingled of a roseate hue; thethroat is adorned with a crest, and the head with a tuft offeathers. The first Roman who described this bird, and whohas done so with the greatest exactness, was the senator Manilius, so famous for his learning; which he owed, too, to theinstructions of no teacher. He tells us that no person hasever seen this bird eat, that in Arabia it is looked upon assacred to the sun, that it lives five hundred and forty years,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>that when it becomes old it builds a nest of cassia and sprigsof incense, which it fills with perfumes, and then lays its bodydown upon them to die; that from its bones and marrow theresprings at first a sort of small worm, which in time changesinto a little bird: that the first thing that it does is to performthe obsequies of its predecessor, and to carry the nest entireto the city of the Sun near Panchaia,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> and there deposit itupon the altar of that divinity.</p><p>The same Manilius states also, that the revolution of thegreat year <span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> is completed with the life of this bird, and that<pb n="2481" />then a new cycle comes round again with the same characteristics as the former one, in the seasons and the appearance ofthe stars; and he says that this begins about mid-day of theday on which the sun enters the sign of Aries. He also tellsus that when he wrote to the above effect, in the consulship<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>of P. Licinius and Cneius Cornelius, it was the two hundredand fifteenth year of the said revolution. Cornelius Valerianussays that the phœnix took its flight from Arabia into Egyptin the consulship<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> of Q. Plautius and Sextus Papinius. Thisbird was brought to Rome in the censorship of the EmperorClaudius, being the year from the building of the City, 800,and it was exposed to public view in the Comitium.<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> Thisfact is attested by the public Annals, but there is no one thatdoubts that it was a fictitious phœnix only.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Ferunt." With regard to this verb, Cuvier remarks, that it is equivocal; and that it is very possible that the writer intends to say, not thatIndia and Æthiopia <hi rend="ital">produce</hi> these marvellous birds, but that the people ofthose countries <hi rend="ital">report</hi> or <hi rend="ital">relate</hi> marvellous stories touching those birds. Itis clear that he does not believe in the existence of the phœnix.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier remarks, that all these relations are neither more nor less thanso many absurd fables or pure allegories, but that the description given isexactly that of a bird which does exist, the golden pheasant, namely. Thedescription given is probably taken from the pretended phœnix that Plinymentions as having been brought to Rome in the reign of Claudius, It isnot improbable, he thinks, that this may have been a golden pheasant,brought from the interior of Asia, when the pursuits of commerce had asyet hardly extended so far, and to which those who showed it gave, mostprobably, the name of the phœnix. Ajasson is of opinion, that under thestory of the phœnix an allegory was concealed, and thinks it may not improbably have been employed to pourtray the doctrine of the immortalityof the soul. Bailly, <hi rend="ital">Hist. de l'Astronomie,</hi> thinks that it bore reference tothe great canicular year of the Egyptians.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Borrowed from Herodotus, B. ii. c. 73.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The MSS. vary considerably as to the number. Some make it 540years, others 511, others 40, and others 560.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Mentioned also, B. vii. c. 57,</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">532 years, according to Hardouin. Bailly says: "The first men whostudied the heavens remarked that the revolution of the sun brought backthe seasons in the same order. They thought that they observed that certain variations of the temperature depended upon the aspect of the moon,and attached different prognostics to the rising and setting of the stars,persuading themselves that the vicissitudes of things here below had regulated periods, like the movements of the heavenly bodies. From this arosethe impression, that the same aspect, the same arrangement of all the stars,that had prevailed at the commencement of the world, would also attendits destruction; and that the period of this long revolution was the predestined duration of the life of nature. Another impression was the idea thatthe world would only perish at this epoch to be born again, and for thesame order of things to recommence with the same series of celestial phenomena. Some fixed this universal renovation at the conjunction of all theplanets, others at the return of the stars to the same point of the ecliptic;others, uniting these two kinds of revolutions, marked the term of the du-ration of all things at the moment at which the planets and the stars wouldreturn to the same primitive situation with regard to the ecliptic, or inother words, they conceived an immense period, which would include oneor more complete revolutions of each of the planets. All these periodswere called the 'great year,' or the 'great revolution.'" <hi rend="ital">Histoire de</hi><hi rend="ital">l'Astronomie Ancienne.</hi></p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A.U.C. 657.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A.U.C. 789.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A public place in the Forum, where the comitia curiata were held,and certain offences tried and punished.</p></body>
