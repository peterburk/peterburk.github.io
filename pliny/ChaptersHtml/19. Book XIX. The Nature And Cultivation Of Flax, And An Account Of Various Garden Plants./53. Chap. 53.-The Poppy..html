<div2 type="chapter" n="53" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 53.—THE POPPY.</head><p>There are certain plants which are grown in company<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> withothers, the poppy, for instance, sown with cabbages and purs-lain, and rocket with lettuce. Of the cultivated poppy<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> thereare three kinds, the first being the white<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> poppy, the seed ofwhich, parched, and mixed with honey, used to be served upin the second course at the tables of the ancients; at the present day, too, the country people sprinkle it on the upper crustof their bread, making it adhere by means of the yolk of eggs,the under crust being seasoned with parsley and gith toheighten the flavour of the flour. The second kind is theblack<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> poppy, from which, upon an incision being made in thestalk, a milky juice distils; and the third is that known to theGreeks by the name of "rhœas;"<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> and by us as the wildpoppy. This last grows spontaneously, but in fields, moreparticularly, which have been sown with barley: it bears astrong resemblance to rocket, grows to the height of a cubit,and bears a red flower, which quickly fades; it is to thisflower that it is indebted for its Greek name.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span></p><p>As to the other kinds of poppies which spring up spontaneously, we shall have occasion to speak of them when treating of the medicinal plants.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> That the poppy has always beenheld in esteem among the Romans, we have a proof in thestory related of Tarquinius<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> Superbus, who, by striking downthe tallest poppies in his garden, surreptitiously conveyed,<pb n="4197" />unknown to them, his sanguinary message through the envoyswho had been sent by his son.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This practice, as Fée remarks, is not followed; and indeed, unless itis intended to transplant them, it would be attended with injurious resultsto the young plants.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">As to the poppy, for further particulars see B. xx. c. 76 and the Note.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The variety Album of the Papaver somniferum of modern botanists.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The variety Nigrum of the Papaver somniferum.
