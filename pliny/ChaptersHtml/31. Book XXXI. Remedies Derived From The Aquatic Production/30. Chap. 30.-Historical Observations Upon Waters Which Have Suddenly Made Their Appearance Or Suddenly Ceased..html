<div2 type="chapter" n="30" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 30.—HISTORICAL OBSERVATIONS UPON WATERS WHICH HAVESUDDENLY MADE THEIR APPEARANCE OR SUDDENLY CEASED.</head><p>It frequently happens that in spots where forests have beenfelled, springs of water make<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> their appearance, the supply ofwhich was previously expended in the nutriment of the trees.This was the case upon Mount Hæmus for example, when,during the siege by Cassander,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> the Gauls cut down a forestfor the purpose of making a rampart. Very often too, afterremoving the wood which has covered an elevated spot andso served to attract and consume the rains, devastating torrentsare formed by the concentration of the waters. It is very important also, for the maintenance of a constant supply ofwater, to till the ground and keep it constantly in motion,taking care to break and loosen the callosities of the surfacecrust: at all events, we find it stated, that upon a city ofCrete, Arcadia by name, being razed to the ground, the springsand water-courses, which before were very numerous in thatlocality, all at once dried up; but that, six years after, when<pb n="5493" />the city was rebuilt, the water again made its appearance, justas each spot was again brought into cultivation.</p><p>(5.) Earthquakes also are apt to discover or swallow<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> upsprings of water; a thing that has happened, it is well known,on five different occasions in the vicinity of Pheneus, a town ofArcadia. So too, upon Mount Corycus,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> a river burst forth;after which, the soil was subjected to cultivation. Thesechanges are very surprising where there is no apparent causefor them; such as the occurrence at Magnesia,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> for instance,where the warm waters became cold, but without losing theirbrackish flavour; and at the Temple<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> of Neptune in Caria,where the water of the river, from being fresh, became salt.Here, too, is another fact, replete with the marvellous—thefountain of Arethusa at Syracuse has a smell of dung, they say,during the celebration of the games at Olympia,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> a thing thatis rendered not improbable by the circumstance,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> that the riverAlpheus makes its way to that island beneath the bed of these-a. There is a spring in the Chersonesus of the Rhodians<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>which discharges its accumulated impurities every nine years.</p><p>Waters, too, sometimes change their colour; as at Babylon,for example, where the water of a certain lake for eleven daysin summer is red. In the summer season, too, the current ofthe Borysthenes<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> is blue, it is said, and this, although itswaters are the most rarefied in existence, and hence float uponthe surface of those of the Hypanis;<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>—though at the same timethere is this marvellous fact, that when south winds prevail, thewaters of the Hypanis assume the upper place. Another proof,too, of the surpassing lightness of the water of the Borysthenes,is the fact that it emits no exhalations, nor, indeed, the slightestvapour even. Authors that would have the credit of diligentresearch in these enquiries, assure us that water becomesheavier after the winter-solstice.<pb n="5494" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ajasson remarks, that just the converse of this has been proved bymodern experience to be the case.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The son of Antipater, then acting for Alexander during his absencein the East.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. ii. c. 84.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In Cilicia.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Whether he means the district of Thessaly so called, or one of thetwo cities of that name in Lydia, does not appear to be known.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Its locality is unknown, but it was probably near the sea-shore.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In Elis in Peloponnesus.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">His credulity is influenced by the popular story that the river Alpheusin Peloponnesus, in its love for the Fountain Nymph Arethusa, penetratedbeneath the bed of the sea, and reappeared in Sicily.
