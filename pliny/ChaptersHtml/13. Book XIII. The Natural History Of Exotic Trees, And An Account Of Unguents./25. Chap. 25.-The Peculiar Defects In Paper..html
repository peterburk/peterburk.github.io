When it is thus polished the paper does not takethe ink so readily, but is of a more lustrous and shining surface.The water of the Nile that has been originally employed inits manufacture, being sometimes used without due precaution,will unfit the paper for taking writing: this fault, however,may be detected by a blow with the mallet, or even bythe smell,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> when the carelessness has been extreme. These<pb n="3191" />spots, too, may be detected by the eye; but the streaks thatrun down the middle of the leaves where they have beenpasted together, though they render the paper spongy and ofa soaking nature, can hardly ever be detected before the inkruns, while the pen is forming the letters; so many are theopenings for fraud to be put in practice. The consequence is,that another labour has been added to the due preparationof paper.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He perhaps means a portion of an elephant's tusk.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Meaning a damp, musty smell.</p></body>
