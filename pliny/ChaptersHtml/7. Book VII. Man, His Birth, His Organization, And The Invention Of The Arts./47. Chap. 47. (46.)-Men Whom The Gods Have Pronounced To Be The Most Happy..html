<div2 type="chapter" n="47" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 47. (46.)—MEN WHOM THE GODS HAVE PRONOUNCED TO BE THE MOST HAPPY.</head><p>In reference to this point, two oracles of Delphi may comeunder our consideration, which would appear to have beenpronounced as though in order to chastise the vanity of man.These oracles were the following: by the first, Pedius waspronounced to be the most happy of men, who had just beforefallen in defence of his country.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> On the second occasion,when it had been consulted by Gyges, at that time the mostpowerful king in the world, it declared that Aglaiis ofPsophis<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> was a more happy man than himself.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> This Aglaiiswas an old man, who lived in a poor petty nook of Arcadia,and cultivated a small farm, though quite sufficient for thesupply of his yearly wants;<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> he had never so much as left it,and, as was quite evident from his mode of living, his desiresbeing of the most limited kind, he had experienced but an extremely small share of the miseries of life.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We have no mention of Pedius, or Phedius, as he is named in some ofthe MSS., in any of the ancient authors. A story of the same import isrelated of Solon and Tellus, by Herodotus, B. i. c. 30, and by Plutarch.—B.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A town of Arcadia. See B. iv. c. 10.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is also related by Valerius Maximus, B. vii. c. 1.—B.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is very similar to Virgil's beautiful description of the old manCoryeius, in the Georgics, B. iv. 1. 125, <hi rend="ital">et seq.</hi></p></body>
