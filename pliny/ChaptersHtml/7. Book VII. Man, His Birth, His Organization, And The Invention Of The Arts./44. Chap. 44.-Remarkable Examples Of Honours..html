<div2 type="chapter" n="44" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 44.—REMARKABLE EXAMPLES OF HONOURS.</head><p>Fortune has determined that P. Ventidius alone should enjoythe honour of a triumph over the Parthians, and yet the sameindividual, when he was a child, she led in the triumphalprocession of Cneius Pompeius, the conqueror of Asculum.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>Indeed, Masurius says, that he had been twice led in triumph;and according to Cicero, he used to let out mules for the bakersof the camp.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> Most writers, indeed, admit that his youngerdays were passed in the greatest poverty, and that he wore thehob-nailed shoes<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> of the common soldier. Balbus Cornelius,<pb n="2190" />also, the elder, was elected to the consulate;<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> but he hadpreviously been accused, and the judges had been chargedto discuss the point whether he could or not lawfully bescourged with rods; he being the first foreigner,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>—born evenon the very shores of the ocean,—who obtained that honour,which our ancestors denied even to the people of Latium.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>Among other remarkable instances, also, we have that of L.Fulvius,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> the consul of the rebellious Tusculani, who, immediately upon his coming over to the Romans, obtained fromthem the same honour. He is the only individual who, inthe same year in which he had been its enemy, enjoyed thehonour of a triumph in Rome, and that too, over the peoplewhose consul he had previously been.Down to the present time, L. Sylla is the only man who hasclaimed to himself the surname of "Happy;"<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> a name whichhe derived, forsooth, from the bloodshed of the citizens andthe oppression of his country! But what claim had he onwhich to found his title to this happiness? Was it the powerwhich he had of proscribing and massacreing so many thousands of his fellow-citizens? Oh interpretation most disgraceful, and which must stamp him as "Unhappy"<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> to all futuretime! Were not the men who perished in those times, ofthe two, to be looked upon as the more fortunate—seeing thatwith them we sympathize, while there is no one who does not<pb n="2191" />detest Sylla? And then, besides, was not the close of his lifemore horrible than the sufferings which had been experiencedby any of those who had been proscribed by him? his very flesheating into itself, and so engendering his own punishment.<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>And this, although he may have thought proper to gloss itover by that last dream of his,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> in the very midst of whichhe may be said, in some measure, to have died; and in which,as he pretended, he was told that his glory alone had risensuperior to all envy; though at the same time, he confessed thatit was still wanting to his supreme happiness, that he had notdedicated the Capitol.<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We have an account of the vicissitudes in the life of Ventidius Bassusin A. Gellius, B. xv. c. 4, and in Valerius Paterculus, B. ii. c. 65. Welearn from these writers, that Ventidius was a native of Picenum, and that,when that city was taken by Cneius Pompeius, in the Social war, Ventidius,then an infant, was carried in his mother's arms, before the car of the conqueror.—B.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The passage of Cicero referred to, occurs in a letter to Plancus, Ep.ad Fam. B. x. Ep. 18, where, speaking of Ventidius, who had united himself to the party of Antony, he says, "And I look down upon the camp ofthe mule-driver, Ventidius."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Caliga." A strong heavy sandal worn by the Roman soldiers andcenturions; but not by the superior officers. The term "a caligâ," therefore, had the same meaning as our expression, "from the ranks." TheEmperor Caligula received that surname when a boy, in consequence ofwearing the caliga, and being inured to the life of a common soldier.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In the year A.U.C. 704.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He was a native of Gades, in Spain. A party of the Roman noblesinduced an inhabitant of Gades to accuse him of having illegally assumedthe privileges of a Roman citizen. The cause was tried B.C. <date value="-55" authname="-55">55</date>, and hewas supported by Pompey and Crassus, and defended by Cicero. One ofthe tests of the being a Roman citizen, was the immunity from beingscourged, according to the provisions of the Porcian law. So St. Paul,who, as a citizen of Tarsus, enjoyed the rights of a Roman citizen, saysto the centurion, Acts xxii. 25, "Is it lawful for you to scourge a manthat is a Roman, and uncondemned?"</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The accusation against Balbus appears to have been his illegal usurpation of the rights of a Roman citizen, being born a foreigner. Plinyhas previously informed us, B. v, c. 5, that he was a native of Gades orCadiz. He was elected consul A.U.C. 713.—B.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">L. Fulvius Curius. consul B.C. <date value="-322" authname="-322">322</date>. In B.C. <date value="-313" authname="-313">313</date> he was master ofthe horse to the dictator, L. Æmilius.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Felix." Hardouin informs us, that he transmitted this surnameto his descendants; among them was Felix, the governor of Judæa, beforewhom St Paul was taken for judgment.—B.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Infelix."</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">According to Pliny, B. xi. c. 39, and Plutarch, Sylla was affected bywhat has been termed the "Morbus pediculosus" or "Lousy disease." Plutarch, however, ascribes his death to the bursting of an internal abscess;and the same cause is assigned by Val. Maximus, B. ix. c. 3.—B. It wasprobably of a similar disease that Herod Agrippa died, whom we findmentioned in Acts xii. 23, as being eaten of worms.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Plutarch refers to a dream which Sylla had a short time before hisdeath, but it does not seem to correspond to the one here alluded to.—B."Plutarch relates that shortly before his death, Sylla dreamed that hisson Cornelius, who died before his wife, Cecilia Metella, appeared to him,and summoned him away to join his mother. Appian also states that justbefore his death, Sylla beheld a spirit in a dream, which summoned him byname; upon which he called together his friends, made his will, and diedsoon after of a fever. Only two days before his death he finished thetwenty-second book of his Memoirs, in which, foreseeing his end, heboasted of the prediction of the Chaldæans, that it was his fate to die aftera happy life, and in the height of his prosperity.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is referred to by Tacitus, Hist. B. iii. c. 73.—B. Plutarch tellsus that Catulus performed this ceremony of dedication.</p></body>
