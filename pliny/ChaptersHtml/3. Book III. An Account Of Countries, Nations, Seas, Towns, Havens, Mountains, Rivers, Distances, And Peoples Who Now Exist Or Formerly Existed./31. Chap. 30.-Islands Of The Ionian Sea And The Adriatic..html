The more famous are thosebefore the mouths of the Timavus, with warm springs<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> thatrise with the tides of the sea, the island of Cissa near theterritory of the Istri, and the Pullaria<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and Absyrtides<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, socalled by the Greeks from the circumstance of Absyrtus,the brother of Medea, having been slain there. Some islandsnear them have been called the Electrides<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>, upon whichamber, which they call "electrum," was said to be found;a most assured instance however of that untruthfulness<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> whichis generally ascribed to the Greeks, seeingthat it has never vet been ascertained which of the islandswere meant by them under that name. Opposite to the Iaderis Lissa, and other islands whose names have been alreadymentioned<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>. Opposite to the Liburni are some islandscalled the Crate¾, and no smaller number styled Liburniec¾and Celaduss¾<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>. Opposite to Surium is Bavo, and Brattia<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>,<pb n="1267" />famous for its goats, Issa with the rights of Roman citizens,and Pharia with a town.

They were so called from the fable that herethe companions of Diomedes were changed into birds. A species of seafowl (which Pliny mentions in B. x. c. 44) were said to be the descendants of these Greek sailors, and to show a great partiality for suchpersons as were of kindred extraction. See Ovid's Metamorphoses,B. xiv. 1. 500. The real number of these islands was a matter of disputewith the ancients, but it seems that there are but three, and some mererocks. The largest of the group is the island of San Domenico, and theothers are San Nicola and Caprara. The small island of Pianosa, elevenmiles N.E., is not considered one of the group, but is not improbablythe Teutria of Pliny. San Domenico was the place of banishment of Julia,the licentious daughter of Augustus.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called the Bagni di Monte Falcone. See B. ii. c. 106.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called Cherso and Osero, off the Illyrian coast. Ptolemymentions only one, Apsorrus, on which he places a town of that nameand another called Crepsa. The Pullaria are now called Li Brioni, inthe Sinus Flanaticus, opposite the city of Pola.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See p. 258.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. xxxvii. c. 11, lie again mentions this circumstance, and statesthat some writers have placed them in the Adriatic opposite the mouthsof the Padus. Scymnus of Chios makes mention of them in conjunctionwith the Absyrtides. This confusion probably arose from the fact previously noted that the more ancient writers had a confused idea that theIster communicated with the Adiatic, at the same time mistaking it probably for the Vistula, which flows into the Baltic. At the mouth of thislast-mentioned river, there were Electrides or "amber-bearing "islands.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Vanitatis."</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Crexa, Gissa, and Colentun, in c. 25.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">According to Brotier, these are situate between the islands of Zuriand Sebenico, and are now called Kasvan, Capri, Smolan, Tihat, Sestre,Parvich, Zlarin, &amp;c. Some writers however suggest that there wereno islands called Celadussse, and that the name in Pliny is a corruption ofDyscelados in Pomponius Mela; which in its turn is supposed to have beeninvented from what was really an epithet of Issa, in a line of ApolloniusRhodius, B. iv. 1. 565. <foreign lang="greek">)Issa\ te duske/lados,</foreign> "andinauspicious Issa." See Brunck's remarks on the passage.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Brazza. According to Brotier the island is still celebratedfor the delicate flavour of the flesh of its goats and lambs. Issa is nowcalled Lissa, and Pharia is the modern Lesina. Baro, now Bua, lies offthe coast of Dalmatia, and was used as a place of banishment under theemperors.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Curzola, or, in the Sclavonic, Karkar. It obtained its name ofNigra or Mel¾na, "black," from the dark colour of its pine woods.Sir G. Wilkinson describes it in his "Dalmatia and Montenegro," vol. i.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called Meleda or Zapuntello. It is more generally to theother island of Melita or Malta that the origin of the "Melit¾i" or Maltesedogs is ascribed. Some writers are of opinion that it was upon thisisland that St. Paul was shipwrecked, and not the larger Melita.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">So called from their resemblance to a stag, <foreign lang="greek">e)/lafos,</foreign> of which themodern Giupan formed the head, Ruda the neck, Mezzo the body, Calamotta the haunches, and the rock of Grebini or Pettini the tail. Theyproduce excellent wine and oil, and are looked upon as the most valuablepart of the Ragusan territory.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Still known as Sasino.

Porcius Cato, or Cato the Elder; famous as a statesman, apatriot, and a philosopher. He wrote "De Re Rustica," a work whichstill survives, and "Letters of Instruction to his Son," of which only somefragments remain. He also wrote a historical work called "Origines,"of which Pliny makes considerable use. Of this also only a few fragmentsare left. His life has been written by Cornelius Nepos, Plutarch, andAurelius Victor.</p><p><span id="note_19"><a href="#ref_19">19. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">M. Vipsanius Agrippa, the distinguished partisan of Augustus, towhose niece Marcella he was married, but he afterwards divorced herfor Julia, the daughter of Augustus by Scribonia, and the widow ofMarcellus. He distinguished himself in Gaul, at Actium, and in Illyria.He constructed many public works at Rome, and among then thePantheon; he also built the splendid aqueduct at Nismes. He diedsuddenlyin his 51st year. His body was buried in the Mausoleum of Augustus,who pronounced his funeral oration. He wrote memoirs of his own life.Pliny often refers to the "Commentarii" of Agrippa, by which are meant,it is supposed, certain official lists drawn up by him in the measurementof the Roman world under Augustus. His map of the world is alsomentioned by Pliny in c. 3 of the present Book.</p><p><span id="note_20"><a href="#ref_20">20. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See end of B. ii.</p><p><span id="note_21"><a href="#ref_21">21. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From Servius, Suetonius and Plutarch we learn that Augustus wroteMemoirs of his Life, in thirteen books; from Suetonius, that he composed a Summary of the Empire (which was probably that referred to inthe above note on Agrippa); and from Quintilian, Aulus Gellius, and Pliny,B. xviii. c. 38, that he published Letters written to his grandson Caius.</p><p><span id="note_22"><a href="#ref_22">22. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">P. Terentius Varro, surnamed Atacinus, from the Atax, a river ofGallia Narbonensis, in which province he was born, B.C. <date value="-82" authname="-82">82</date>. Of his"Argonautica," his "Cosmographia" (probably the same with his "Iter"),his "Navales Libri," and his Heroic and Amatory Poems, only a fewfragments now exist.

Julius Hyainus, a native of Spain, and freedman of Augustus, bywhom he was placed at the Palatine Library. He lived upon terms ofintimacy with Ovid. He wrote works on the sites of the cities of Italy,the Nature of the Gods, an account of the Penates, an account of Virgil(probably the same as the work called "Commentaries on Virgil"), on theFamilies of Trojan descent, on Agriculture, the "Propempticon Cinn¾,"the Lives of Illustrious Men (quoted by John of Salisbury in his "Polycraticon "), a book of Examples, and a work on the Art of War, also mentioned by John of Salisbury. A book of Fables, and an AstronomicalPoem, in four books, are ascribed to him, but they are probably productions of a later age.</p><p><span id="note_25"><a href="#ref_25">25. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">L. Antistius Vetus, Consul with Nero, A.D. <date value="55" authname="55">55</date>. While commanding in Germany he formed the project of connecting the Moselle and theSaone by a canal, thus establishing a communication between the Mediterranean and the Northern Ocean. Nero having resolved on his death,he anticipated his sentence by opening his veins in a warm bath. Hismother-in-law Sextia, and his daughter Pollentia, in a similar mannerperished with him.</p><p><span id="note_26"><a href="#ref_26">26. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He was born, it is supposed, at Tingentera, or Cingentera, on the bayof Algesiras, and probably flourished in the reign of Claudius. He wasthe first Roman author who wrote a treatise on Geography. It is stillextant, and bears marks of great care, while it is written in pureand unaffected language.</p><p><span id="note_27"><a href="#ref_27">27. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">C. Scribonius Curio, the third known of that name. He was thefirst Roman general who advanced as far as the Danube. Like his sonof the same name, he was a violent opponent of Julius C¾sar. He waseloquent as an orator, but ignorant and uncultivated. His orations werepublished, as also an invective against C¾sar, in form of a dialogue, inwhich his son was introduced as one of the interlocutors. He died B.C. <date value="-53" authname="-53">53</date>.</p><p><span id="note_28"><a href="#ref_28">28. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">L. C¾lius Antipater.

Augustus declared in his last illnessthat he was worthy of the empire. This, with his riches and talents,rendered him an object of suspicion to Tiberius. Being charged as anaccomplice in the crimes of Albucilla, he put himself to death by openinghis veins. It appears not to be certain whether it was this person or hisfather who wrote a history of the first Punic war, in which he imitatedthe style of Sallust.</p><p><span id="note_30"><a href="#ref_30">30. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Statius Sebosus.

Ateius here mentioned wasprobably the person surnamed Pr¾textatus, and Philologus, a freedmanof the jurist Ateius Capito. For Sallust the historian he composed anAbstract of Roman History, and for Asinius Pollio he compiled preceptson the Art of Writing. His Commentaries were numerous, but a fewonly were surviving in the time of Suetonius.</p><p><span id="note_34"><a href="#ref_34">34. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">C.

He was the rival of Labeo, the republican jurist. His legalworks were very voluminous, and extracts from them are to be found inthe Digest. He also wrote a work on the Pontifical Rights and the Lawof Sacrifices.</p><p><span id="note_35"><a href="#ref_35">35. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A distinguished grammarian of the latter part of the first centuryB.C. He was entrusted by Augustus with the education of his grandsonsCaius and Lucius C¾sar. He died at an advanced age in the reign ofTiberius. He wrote upon antiquities, history, and philosophy: amonghis numerous works a History of the Etruscans is mentioned, also atreatise on Orthography.

He was burnt with his house at Laurentum. Other writerssay that he was a native of Cati¾um in Lesser Phrygia. The surname of"Polyhistor" was given to him for his prodigious learning. His greatestwork seems to have been a historical and geographical account of theworld, in forty-two books.
