<div2 type="chapter" n="4" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 4. (5.)—THE FORMS OF THE TRITONS AND NEREIDS. THE FORMS OF SEA ELEPHANTS.</head><p>A deputation of persons from Olisipo,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> that had been sentfor the purpose, brought word to the Emperor Tiberius that atriton had been both seen and heard in a certain cavern, blowinga conch-shell,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and of the form under which they are usually<pb n="2363" />represented. Nor yet is the figure generally attributed to thenereids<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> at all a fiction; only in them, the portion of the bodythat resembles the human figure is still rough all over withscales. For one of these creatures was seen upon the sameshores, and as it died, its plaintive murmurs were heard evenby the inhabitants at a distance. The legatus of Gaul,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> too,wrote word to the late Emperor Augustus that a considerablenumber of nereids had been found dead upon the sea-shore. Ihave, too, some distinguished informants of equestrian rank,who state that they themselves once saw in the ocean of Gadesa sea-man,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> which bore in every part of his body a perfect resemblance to a human being, and that during the night hewould climb up into ships; upon which the side of the vesselwhere he seated himself would instantly sink downward, andif he remained there any considerable time, even go underwater.</p><p>In the reign of the Emperor Tiberius, a subsidence of theocean left exposed on the shores of an island which faces theprovince of Lugdunum<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> as many as three hundred animals ormore, all at once, quite marvellous for their varied shapes andenormous size, and no less a number upon the shores of the<pb n="2364" />Santones;<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> among the rest there were elephants<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> and rams,which last, however, had only a white spot to represent horns.Turranius has also left accounts of several nereids, and hespeaks of a monster<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> that was thrown up on the shore atGades, the distance between the two fins at the end of the tailof which was sixteen cubits, and its teeth one hundred andtwenty in number; the largest being nine, and the smallestsix inches in length.</p><p>M. Scaurus, in his ædileship, exhibited at Rome, among otherwonderful things, the bones of the monster to which Andromeda was said to have been exposed, and which he had broughtfrom Joppa, a city of Judæa. These bones exceeded forty feetin length, and the ribs were higher than those of the Indianelephant, while the back-bone was a foot and a half<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> in thickness.<pb n="2365" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Lisbon. See B. iv. c. 35.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">One of the Scholiasts on Homer says, that before the discovery of thebrazen trumpet by the Tyrrhenians, the conch-shell was in general usefor that purpose. Hardouin, with considerable credulity, remarks here,that it is no fable, that the nereids and tritons had a human face; and saysthat no less than fifteen instances, ancient and modern, had been adduced,in proof that such was the fact. He says that this was the belief of Scaliger, and quotes the book of Aldrovandus on Monsters, p. 36. But, asCuvier remarks, it is impossible to explain these stories of nereids andtritons, on any other grounds than the fraudulent pretences of those who have exhibited them, or asserted that they have seen them. "It was onlylast year," he says, "that all London was resorting to see a wonderful sightin what is commonly called a mermaid. I myself had the opportunity ofexamining a very similar object: it was the body of a child, in the mouthof which they had introduced the jaws of a sparus [probably our "gilthead]," while for the legs was substituted the body of a lizard. The bodyof the London mermaid," he says, "was that of an ape, and a fish attachedto it supplied the place of the hind legs."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Primarily the nereids were sea-nymphs, the daughters of Nereus andDoris. Dalechamps informs us, that Alexander ab Alexandro states thathe once saw a nereid that had been thrown ashore on the coasts of thePeloponnesus, that Trapezuntius saw one as it was swimming, and thatDraconetus Bonifacius, the Neapolitan, saw a triton that had been preserved in honey, and which many had seen when taken alive on the coastof Epirus. We may here remark, that the triton is the same as our "merman," and the nereid is our "mermaid."</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Of Gallia Lugdunensis, namely. The legatus was also called "rector," and "proprætor."</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "mer-man," as we call it. Dalechamps, in his note, with all thecredulity of his time, states that a similar sea-man had been captured, itwas said, in the preceding age in Norway, and that another had been seenin Poland, dressed like a bishop, in the year <date value="1531" authname="1531">1531</date>. Juvenal, in his 14thSatire, makes mention of the "monsters of the ocean, and the youths of thesea."</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. iv. c. 31, 32.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. iv. c. 33.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Dalechamps says that this elephant is the same as the "rosmarus" ofOlaus Magnus, B. xxxii. c. 11. It is remarked by Cuvier, that cetaceousanimals have at all times received the names of those belonging to the land.The sea-ram, he thinks, may have been the great dolphin, which is calledthe "bootskopf," and which has above the eye a white spot, curved in nearlya similar manner to the horn of a ram. The "elephant," again, he suggests,may have been the Trichechus rosmarus of Linnæus, or the morse, whichhas large tusks projecting from its mouth, similar to those of the elephant.This animal, however, as he says, is confined to the northern seas, and doesnot appear ever to have come so far south as our coasts. Juba and Pausanias, however, speak of these horns of the sea-ram as being really teethor tusks.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Judging from the account of it here given, and especially in relationto the teeth, Cuvier is inclined to think that the cachelot whale, the Physeter macrocephalus of Linnæus, is the animal here alludedto.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Solinus, generally a faithful mimic of Pliny, makes the measure onlyhalf a foot. Cuvier says that there can be little doubt that the bones represented to have been those of the monster to which Andromeda was exposed, were the bones, and more especially the lower jaws, of the whale.Ajasson certainly appears to have mistaken the sense of this passage. Hesays that it must not be supposed that Pliny means the identical bones ofthe animal which was about to devour Andromeda, but of one of the animals of that kind; and he exercises his wit at the expense of those whowould construe the passage differently, in saying that these bones ought tohave been sent to those who show in their collections such articles as theknife with which Cain slew Abel. Now, there can be no doubt that thesebones were <hi rend="ital">not</hi> those of the monster which the poets tell us was about todevour Andromeda; but the Romans certainly supposed that they were,and Pliny evidently thought so too, for in B. v. c. 14, he speaks of thechains by which she was fastened to the rock, at Joppa, as still to be seenthere. M. Æmilius Scaurus, the younger, is here referred to.</p></body>
