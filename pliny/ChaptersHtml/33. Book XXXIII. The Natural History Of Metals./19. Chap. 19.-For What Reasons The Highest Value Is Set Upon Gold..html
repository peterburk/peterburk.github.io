<div2 type="chapter" n="19" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 19.—FOR WHAT REASONS THE HIGHEST VALUE IS SET UPON GOLD.</head><p>We have already stated, in the Seventh<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> Book, who were thefirst discoverers of gold, as well as nearly all the other metals.The highest rank has been accorded to this substance, not, inmy opinion, for its colour, (which in silver is clearer<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and morelike the light of day, for which reason silver is preferred forour military ensigns, its brightness being seen at a greater distance);and those persons are manifestly in error who thinkthat it is the resemblance of its colour to the stars<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> that isso prized in gold, seeing that the various gems<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and otherthings of the same tint, are in no such particular request.Nor yet is it for its weight or malleability<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> that gold has beenpreferred to other metals, it being inferior in both these respectsto lead—but it is because gold is the only<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> substance innature that suffers<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> no loss from the action of fire, and passesunscathed through conflagrations and the flames of the funeralpile. Nay, even more than this, the oftener gold is subjectedto the action of fire, the more refined in quality it becomes;indeed, fire is one test of its goodness, as, when sub-<pb n="6097" />mitted to intense heat, gold ought to assume a similar colour,and turn red and igneous in appearance; a mode of testingwhich is known as "obrussa."<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span></p><p>The first great proof, however, of the goodness of gold, isits melting with the greatest difficulty: in addition to which,it is a fact truly marvellous, that though proof against the mostintense fire, if made with wood charcoal, it will melt with thegreatest readiness upon a fire made with chaff;<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> and that, forthe purpose of purifying it, it is fused with lead.<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> There isanother reason too, which still more tends to enhance its value,the fact that it wears the least of all metals by continual use:whereas with silver, copper, and lead, lines may be traced,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> andthe hands become soiled with the substance that comes from offthem. Nor is there any material more malleable than this,none that admits of a more extended division, seeing that asingle ounce of it admits of being beaten out into seven hundredand fifty<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> leaves, or more, four fingers in length by thesame in breadth. The thickest kind of gold-leaf is known as"leaf of Præncste,"it still retaining that name from theexcellence of the gilding upon the statue of Fortune<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> there.The next in thickness is known as the "quæstorian leaf." InSpain, small pieces of gold are known by the name of "striges."<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span></p><p>A thing that is not the case with any other metal, gold isfound pure in masses<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> or in the form of dust;<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> and whereas<pb n="6098" />all other metals, when found in the ore, require to be broughtto perfection by the aid of fire, this gold that I am speaking ofis gold the moment it is found, and has all its component partsalready in a state of perfection. This, however, is only suchgold as is found in the native state, the other kinds that weshall have to speak of, being refined by art. And then, morethan anything else, gold is subject to no rust, no verdigris,<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span>no emanation whatever from it, either to alter its quality orto lessen its weight. In addition to this, gold steadily resiststhe corrosive action of salt and vinegar,<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> things which obtainthe mastery over all other substances: it admits, too, beyondall other metals, of being spun out and woven<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> like wool.<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> Verriustells us that Tarquinius Priscus celebrated a triumph, cladin a tunic of gold; and I myself have seen Agrippina, the wifeof the Emperor Claudius, on the occasion of a naval combatwhich he exhibited, seated by him, attired in a military scarf<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span>made entirely of woven gold without any other material. Forthis long time past, gold has been interwoven in the Attalic<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span>textures, an invention of the kings of Asia.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Chapter 57.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In fact, no colour at all.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In <hi rend="ital">this</hi> climate, the light of most of the stars has the complexion, notof gold, but of silver.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The topaz, for instance.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">For ductility and malleability, both which terms may perhaps be includedin the "facilitas" of Pliny, gold is unrivalled among the metals. Asto weight, it is heavier than lead, the specific gravity of gold being 19.258,and that of lead 11 352. Pliny is therefore wrong in both of these assertions.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He forgets asbestus here, a substance which he has mentioned inB. xix. c. 4.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Chlorine, however, and nitro-muriatic acid corrode and dissolve gold,forming a chloride of gold, which is soluble in water. Ajasson remarks,that gold becomes volatilized by the heat of a burning glass of three orfour feet in diameter; and that when it acts as the conductor of a strongcurrent of electricity, it becomes reduced to dust instantaneously, presentinga bright greenish light.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The gold thus tested was called "obrussum," "obryzum," or "obrizum,"from the Greek <foreign lang="greek">o)/bruzon</foreign>, meaning "pure gold."</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xviii. c. 23, where he calls the chaff used for this purpose by thename of "acus."</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The present mode of assaying the precious metals, is by fusing themupon a cupel with lead.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">For which purpose, lead was used, no doubt, in drawing the lines in theMSS. of the ancients.
