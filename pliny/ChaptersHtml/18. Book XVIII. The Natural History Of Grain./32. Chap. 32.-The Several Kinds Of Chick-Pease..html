This plant presents considerable differences in reference to size, colour,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> form, and taste.One variety resembles in shape a ram's head, from which circumstance it has received the name of "arietinum;" thereare both the white and the black arietinum. There is also thecolumbine chick-pea, by some known as the "pea of Venus;"it is white, round, and smooth, being smaller than the arietinum, and is employed in the observances of the night festivalsor vigils. The chicheling vetch,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> too, is a diminutive kind ofchick-pea, unequal and angular, like<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> the pea. The chickpea that is the sweetest in flavour is the one that bears theclosest resemblance to the fitch; the pod in the black and thered kinds is more firmly closed than in the white ones.<pb n="4047" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cicer arietinum of the botanists.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Gigni cum salsilagine."
