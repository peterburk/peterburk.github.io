<div2 type="chapter" n="25" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 25.ÑTHE ARIANI AND THE ADJOINING NATIONS.</head><p>We will now proceed to give some further particulars<pb n="2057" />relative to the four Satrapies, of which we have postponedfurther mention<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> till the present occasion.</p><p>(23). After passing the nations in the vicinity of the Indus,we come to the mountain districts. The territory of Capisene formerly had a city, called Capisa,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> which was destroyedby Cyrus. Arachosia<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> has a river and a city of the samename; the city was built by Semiramis; by some writersit is called Cophen. The river Erymanthus<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> flows pastParabeste,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> which belongs to the Arachosii. Writers makethe Dexendrusi come next, forming the boundary of theArachot¾ on the southern side, and of the Paropanisad¾ onthe north. The city of Cartana<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> lies at the foot of Caucasus; in later times it has been called Tetragonis.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> Thisregion lies over against that of the Bactri, who come next,and whose chief city is Alexandria,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> so called from thename of its founder. We then come to the Syndraci,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> the<pb n="2058" />Dangal¾<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> the Parapin¾,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> the Catuces, and the Mazi; andthen at the foot of Caucasus, to the Cadrusi, whose town<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> wasbuilt by Alexander.</p><p>Below all these countries, is the line of coast which we cometo after leaving the Indus. Ariana<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> is a region parched by thesun and surrounded by deserts; still, however, as the face ofthe country is every here and there diversified with well-shadedspots, it finds communities grouped together to cultivate it,and more especially around the two rivers, known as theTonberos<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> and the Arosapes.<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> There is also the town ofArtacoana,<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> and the river Arius,<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> which flows past Alexandria,<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> a city founded by Alexander; this place is thirtystadia in extent. Much more beautiful than it, as well asof much greater antiquity, is Artacabane,<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> fortified a secondtime by Antiochus, and fifty stadia in breadth. We thencome to the nation of the Dorisdorsigi, and the rivers Phar-<pb n="2059" />naracotis,<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> and Ophradus; and then to Prophthasia,<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> a city ofthe Zaraspades, the Drang¾,<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> the Everget¾,<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span> the Zarang¾,and the Gedrusi;<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span> the towns of Pucolis, Lyphorta, the desertof the Methorgi,<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span> the river Manais,<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span> the nation of theAcutri, the river Eorum, the nation of the Orbi, the Pomanus,a navigable river in the territories of the Pandares, the Apirusin the country of the Suari, with a good harbour at its mouth,the city of Condigramma, and the river Cophes;<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span> into whichlast flow the navigable streams of the Saddaros,<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span> the Parospus, and the Sodanus. Some writers will also have it thatDaritis<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span> forms part of Ariana, and give the length of themboth as nineteen hundred and fifty miles, and the breadth onehalf of that<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span> of India. Others again have spread the Gedrusiand the Pasires over an extent of one hundred and thirty-eight miles, and place next to them the Ichthyophagi Orit¾,<span id="ref_31"><a href="#note_31">[31]</a></span>a people who speak a language peculiar to themselves, and notthe Indian dialect, extending over a space of two hundred miles.Alexander forbade the whole of the Ichthyophagi<span id="ref_32"><a href="#note_32">[32]</a></span> to live any<pb n="2060" />longer on fish. Next after these the writers have placed extensive deserts, and then Carmania, Persia, and Arabia.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Mentioned already, towards the conclusion of c. 23 of the presentBook. See p. 51.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This place was included in the district of the Paropanisus or HindooKoosh. It is doubtful whether Pliny is correct in saying that it was destroyed by Cyrus, as we have no reason for supposing that he everadvanced so far to the north-east. It is supposed by some that Capisenerepresents the valley of the Kabul river, and Capisa the town on theIndus, now known as Peshawar. Lassen, in his researches, has found inthe Chinese annals a kingdom called Kiapiche, in the valley of Ghurbend,to the east of Bamian. It is not improbable that Capisa and Kiapichewere different forms of the same name.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See the Notes in p. 50.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The principal river of Drangiana, which rises in the lower range of theParopanisus or Hindoo Koosh, and enters Lake Zarah. Its present nameis Ilmend or Helmend. Burnouf has supposed it to be the same as theArachotus; but Professor Wilson is of opinion that the Arachotus wasone of the tributaries of the Erymanthus or Erymandrus, and probablythe modern Arkand-Ab.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Parisot takes the meaning of this word to be "valley," and is ofopinion that it is the modern Chabul; not to be confounded, however,with the country of Cabul, to the east of which it is situate.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called Birusen, according to Parisot, and not the city of Cabul,as supposed by Hardouin.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or the "four-cornered city."</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This place has not been identified. It has been suggested that it isthe same as the modern city of Candahar; but that was really Alexandriaof the Paropanisad¾, quite a different place.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Inhabiting the district now called Arassen, according to Parisot.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Inhabiting the modern Danra, according to Parisot.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Inhabitants of the modern Parasan, according to Parisot.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The modern Candahar is generally supposed to occupy its site.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny is thought to have here confounded the extensive district ofAriana with the smaller province of Aria, which only formed a portion ofit. Ariana comprehended nearly the whole of what had been previouslyancient Persia</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The river known in modern times as the Ilincut, according to Parisot.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is supposed by Forbiger to be the modern Arghasan, one of thetributaries of the Helmend. Parisot says that it was the same as themodern Sat.</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">27 Supposed to be the same as the "Aria civitas," or "city of Aria" ofother authors, which, however, is most probably represented by Alexandria,the modern Herat, situate on the small stream now called the Heri-Rud.At all events, Artacoana (proved by M. Court to be a word of Persian originÑArde Koun) was, if not the same place, at a very small distance from it.M. Barbie de Bocage is of opinion that it occupied the site of Fushing,a town on the Heri river, one stage from Herat; and by M. Court it isthought to have been at Obeh, near the same place.</p><p><span id="note_17"><a href="#ref_17">17. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called the Heri-Rud, which runs to the west of Herat.</p><p><span id="note_18"><a href="#ref_18">18. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is said that, judging from a traditional verse still current amongthe people of Herat, that town is believed to unite the claims of theancient capital built by Alexander the Great, or indeed, more properly,repaired by him, as he was but a short time in Aria. The distance alsofrom the Caspian Gates to Alexandria favours its identification with themodern Herat.</p><p><span id="note_19"><a href="#ref_19">19. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This place does not appear to have been identified.</p><p><span id="note_20"><a href="#ref_20">20. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ansart suggests that the river Pharnacotis is the same as the modernFerrichround, and the Ophradus probably the Kouchround.</p><p><span id="note_21"><a href="#ref_21">21. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ansart suggests that the modern name is Zarang. Parisot says thatit is Corcharistan.</p><p><span id="note_22"><a href="#ref_22">22. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The inhabitants of Drangiana, a district at the eastern end of themodern kingdom of Persia, and comprehending part of the presentSejestan or Seistan.</p><p><span id="note_23"><a href="#ref_23">23. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">They gave its name to the modern Eudras, according to Parisot.</p><p><span id="note_24"><a href="#ref_24">24. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is doubtful whether these are the same as the Gedrosi, mentionedby Pliny in c. 23, 24. Parisot censures Hardouin for confounding them,and says that these inhabited the modern Bassar. In Dr. Smith's <hi rend="ital">Dic-</hi><hi rend="ital">tionary,</hi> they are looked upon as the same people.</p><p><span id="note_25"><a href="#ref_25">25. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Parisot says that this is the desert region now known as Eremaier, tothe east of Mount Maugracot.</p><p><span id="note_26"><a href="#ref_26">26. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">As Parisot remarks, our author is now approaching the sea-shore;these places, however, do not appear to have been identified.</p><p><span id="note_27"><a href="#ref_27">27. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Not the same as the river Cophen or Cophes mentioned in c. 24, themodern Kabul. Hardouin takes it to be the same as the Arbis or Arabiusof Ptolemy, the modern Hilmend or Ilmend.</p><p><span id="note_28"><a href="#ref_28">28. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Parisot seems to think that the modern names of these rivers are the Sal,the Ghir, and the Ilmentel, which, according to him, flow into the Ilmend.</p><p><span id="note_29"><a href="#ref_29">29. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Situate, according to Ptolemy, in the eastern parts of Media.</p><p><span id="note_30"><a href="#ref_30">30. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">For this measurement see c. 21.</p><p><span id="note_31"><a href="#ref_31">31. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Meaning the "Fish-eating Mountaineers."
