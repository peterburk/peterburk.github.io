THE ANTHERICUSOR ALBUCUS.</head><p>Other plants of the bulbous kind differ in the leaf: that ofthe asphodel<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> is long and narrow, that of the squill broad andsupple, and the form of that of the gladiolus is bespoken by itsname.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> The asphodel is used as an article of food, the seed ofit being parched, and the bulb roasted;<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> this last, however,<pb n="4360" />should be cooked in hot ashes, and then eaten with salt andoil. It is beaten up also with figs, and forms, as Hesiod assures us, a very delicate dish. It is said, too, that the asphodel,planted before the doors of a farm-house, will act as a preservative against the effects of noxious spells.</p><p>Homer,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> too, makes mention of the asphodel. The bulbsof it are like moderately-sized turnips, and there is no plantthe root of which has more of them, as many as eighty bulbsbeing often grouped together. Theophrastus, and nearly allthe Greek writers, with Pythagoras at the head of them, havegiven the name of "anthericos" to its stem, which is one cubit,and often two, in length, the leaves being very similar to thoseof the wild leek; it is to the root, or in other words, the bulbs,that they have given the name of asphodel. The people of ourcountry call this plant<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> "albucus," and they give the nameof "royal<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> spear" to the asphodel the stem of which bearsberries,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> thus distinguishing two<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> varieties of it. The albucus has a stalk a cubit in length, large, naked, and smooth, inreference to which, Mago recommends that it should be cut atthe end of March and the beginning of April, the period atwhich it blossoms, and before the seed has begun to swell; hesays, too, that the stalks should be split, and exposed on thefourth day in the sun, after which, when dry, they should bemade up into bundles.</p><p>The same author states, also, that the Greeks give the nameof "pistana" to the aquatic plant known to us as the "sagitta;"<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> and he recommends that it should be stripped of itsbark, and dried in a mild sun, between the ides of May<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> andthe end of October. He says, too, that it is usual to cut downto the root, throughout all the month of July, the variety ofthe gladiolus called "cypiros," which is a marsh-plant also,and at the end of three days to dry it in the sun, until it turnswhite; but that care must be taken every day to carry it undercover before sunset, the night dews being very injurious tomarsh plants when cut.<pb n="4361" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Asphodelus ramosus of Linn¾us.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Little sword."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is no longer employed as an article of food.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Od. xi. 539, and xxiv. 13.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is difficult to say to what "illud" refers, if, indeed, it is the correctreading.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Hastula regia."</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Caulis acinosi."</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxii. c. 32.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Arrow."
