<div2 type="chapter" n="10" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 10.ÑTHE RIVER NILE.</head><p>The sources of the Nile<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> are unascertained, and, travellingas it does for an immense distance through deserts and burningsands, it is only known to us by common report, havingneither experienced the vicissitudes of warfare, nor beenvisited by those arms which have so effectually explored allother regions. It rises, so far indeed as King Juba wasenabled to ascertain, in a mountain<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> of Lower Mauritania,not far from the ocean; immediately after which it forms alake of standing water, which bears the name of Nilides<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>.In this lake are found the several kinds of fish known bythe names of alabeta<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, coracinus, and silurus; a crocodilealso was brought thence as a proof that this really is theNile, and was consecrated by Juba himself in the temple ofIsis at C¾sarea<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>, where it may be seen at the present day.In addition to these facts, it has been observed that thewaters of the Nile rise in the same proportion in which the<pb n="1411" />snows and rains of Mauritania increase. Pouring forth fromthis lake, the river disdains to flow through arid and sandydeserts, and for a distance of several days' journey concealsitself; after which it bursts forth at another lake of greatermagnitude in the country of the Mass¾syli<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>, a people ofMauritania C¾sariensis, and thence casts a glance around, asit were, upon the communities of men in its vicinity, givingproofs of its identity in the same peculiarities of the animalswhich it produces. It then buries itself once again in thesands of the desert, and remains concealed for a distance oftwenty days' journey, till it has reached the confines of ®thiopia.Here, when it has once more become sensible of the presenceof man, it again emerges, at the same source, in all probability,to which writers have given the name of Niger, orBlack. After this, forming the boundary-line between Africaand ®thiopia, its banks, though not immediately peopled byman, are the resort of numbers of wild beasts and animalsof various kinds. Giving birth in its course to denseforests of trees, it travels through the middle of ®thiopia,under the name of Astapus, a word which signifies, in thelanguage of the nations who dwell in those regions, "waterissuing from the shades below." Proceeding onwards, itdivides<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> innumerable islands in its course, and some of themof such vast magnitude, that although its tide runs with thegreatest rapidity, it is not less than five days in passingthem. When making the circuit of Mero‘, the mostfamous of these islands, the left branch of the river is calledAstobores<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>, or, in other words, "an arm of the water thatissues from the shades," while the right arm has the nameof Astosapes<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>, which adds to its original signification the<pb n="1412" />meaning of "side<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>." It does not obtain the name of "Nile"until its waters have again met and are united in a singlestream; and even then, for some miles both above andbelow the point of confluence, it has the name of Siris.Homer has given to the whole of this river the name of®gyptus, while other writers again have called it Triton<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>.Every now and then its course is interrupted by islands whichintervene, and which only serve as so many incentives toadd to the impetuosity of its torrent; and though at lastit is hemmed in by mountains on either side, in no part isthe tide more rapid and precipitate. Its waters then hasteningonwards, it is borne along to the spot in the country ofthe ®thiopians which is known by the name of "Catadupi<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>;"where, at the last Cataract<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>, the complaint is, not that itflows, but that it rushes, with an immense noise between therocks that lie in its way: after which it becomes moresmooth, the violence of its waters is broken and subdued,and, wearied out as it were by the length of the distance ithas travelled, it discharges itself, though by many mouths<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>,into the Egyptian sea. During certain days of the year, however,the volume of its waters is greatly increased, and as ittraverses the whole of Egypt, it inundates the earth, and,by so doing, greatly promotes its fertility.</p><p>There have been various reasons suggested for this increaseof the river. Of these, however, the most probable are,<pb n="1413" />either that its waters are driven back by the Etesian winds<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>,which are blowing at this season of the year from an oppositedirection, and that the sea which lies beyond is driveninto the mouths of the river; or else that its waters areswollen by the summer rains of ®thiopia<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span>, which fall fromthe clouds conveyed thither by the Etesian winds fromother parts of the earth. Tim¾us the mathematician hasalleged a reason of an occult nature: he says that the sourceof the river is known by the name of Phiala, and that thestream buries itself in channels underground, where it sendsforth vapours generated by the heat among the steamingrocks amid which it conceals itself; but that, during the daysof the inundation, in consequence of the sun approachingnearer to the earth, the waters are drawn forth by theinfluence of his heat, and on being thus exposed to theair, overflow; after which, in order that it may not beutterly dried up, the stream hides itself once more. Hesays that this takes place at the rising of the Dog-Star,when the sun enters the sign of Leo, and stands in a verticalposition over the source of the river, at which time atthat spot there is no shadow thrown. Most authors, however,are of opinion, on the contrary, that the river flows in greatervolume when the sun takes his departure for the north, whichhe does when he enters the signs of Cancer and Leo, becauseits waters then are not dried up to so great an extent; whileon the other hand, when he returns towards the south pole andre-enters Capricorn, its waters are absorbed by the heat,and consequently flow in less abundance. If there isany one inclined to be of opinion, with Tim¾us, that thewaters of the river may be drawn out of the earth by theheat, it will be as well for him to bear in mind the fact, thatthe absence of shadow is a ph¾nomenon which lasts continuously<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span>in these regions.<pb n="1414" /></p><p>The Nile begins to increase at the next new moon afterthe summer solstice, and rises slowly and gradually as thesun passes through the sign of Cancer; it is at its greatestheight while the sun is passing through Leo, and it falls asslowly and gradually as it arose while he is passing throughthe sign of Virgo. It has totally subsided between itsbanks, as we learn from Herodotus, on the hundredth day,when the sun has entered Libra. While it is rising it has beenpronounced criminal for kings or prefects even to sail uponits waters. The measure of its increase is ascertained bymeans of wells<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span>. Its most desirable height is sixteen cubits<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span>;if the waters do not attain that height, the overflow is notuniversal; but if they exceed that measure, by their slownessin receding they tend to retard the process of cultivation.In the latter case the time for sowing is lost, in consequenceof the moisture of the soil; in the former, the ground is soparched that the seed-time comes to no purpose. The countryhas reason to make careful note of either extreme. Whenthe water rises to only twelve cubits, it experiences thehorrors of famine; when it attains thirteen, hunger is stillthe result; a rise of fourteen cubits is productive of gladness;a rise of fifteen sets all anxieties at rest; while anincrease of sixteen is productive of unbounded transports ofjoy. The greatest increase known, up to the present time,is that of eighteen cubits, which took place in the timeof the Emperor Claudius; the smallest rise was that of five,in the year of the battle of Pharsalia<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span>, the river by thisprodigy testifying its horror, as it were, at the murder ofPompeius Magnus. When the waters have reached theirgreatest height, the people open the embankments and admitthem to the lands. As each district is left by the waters,the business of sowing commences. This is the only riverin existence that emits no vapours<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span>.</p><p>The Nile first enters the Egyptian territory at Syene<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span>, on<pb n="1415" />the frontiers of ®thiopia; that is the name of a peninsula amile in circumference, upon which Castra<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span> is situate, on theside of Arabia. Opposite to it are the four islands ofPhil¾<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span>, at a distance of 600 miles from the place wherethe Nile divides into two channels; at which spot, aswe have already stated, the Delta, as it is called, begins.This, at least, is the distance, according to Artemidorus,who also informs us that there were in it 250 towns; Jubasays, however, that the distance between these places is 400miles. Aristocreon says that the distance from Elephantisto the sea is 750 miles; Elephantis<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span> being an inhabitedisland four miles below the last Cataract, sixteen<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span> beyondSyene, 585 from Alexandria, and the extreme limit of thenavigation of Egypt. To such an extent as this have theabove-named authors<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span> been mistaken! This island is theplace of rendezvous for the vessels of the ®thiopians: theyare made to fold up<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span>, and the people carry them on theirshoulders whenever they come to the Cataracts.<pb n="1416" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">And it is generally supposed that they are so up to the present day. The ethnographer Jablonski is of opinion that this river derives its name from the Coptish word <hi rend="ital">tneialei</hi> "to rise at stated times." Servius, the commentator on Virgil, says that it is derived from the two Greek words <foreign lang="greek">ne/a i)lu\s</foreign> "fresh mud," in allusion to the fresh mud or slime which it leaves after each inundation. Singularly enough, Champollion prefers this silly etymology to that suggested by Jablonski.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">An interesting disquisition on the probable sources of the Nile, as viewed by the ancients, is to be found in the Ninth Book of Lucan's Pharsalia.

It is possible however that the ancients may have had some knowledge of Lake Tchad, and the Mountains of the Moon, or Djebel-Kumri, though at the same time it is more than doubtful that the Nile has its source in either of those localities, the former especially.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Perhaps a kind of river lamprey. As to the Coracinus, see B. ix. c. 24, 32, and B. xxxii. c. 19, 24, 34, 44, and 53; and as to the Silurus, B. ix. c. 17, 25, and B. xxxii. c. 31, 36, 40, 43, 44, &amp;c.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The modern Vacur in Northern Africa.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A district which in reality was at least <date value="1200" authname="1200">1200</date> or 1500 miles distant from any part of the Nile, and probably near 3000 from its real source.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Spargit."

It was an important point inthe geography and astronomy of the ancients; for, lying just under thetropic of Cancer, it was chosen as the place through which they drewtheir chief parallel of latitude. The sun was vertical to Syene at thetime of the summer solstice, and a well was shown there where the faceof the sun was seen at noon at that time.
