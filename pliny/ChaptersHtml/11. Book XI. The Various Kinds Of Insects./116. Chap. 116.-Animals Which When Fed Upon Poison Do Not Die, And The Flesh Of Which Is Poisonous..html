Some of them, which are harmless of themselves,become noxious if fed upon venomous substances. The wildboar of Pamphylia and the mountainous parts of Cilicia, afterhaving devoured a salamander, will become poisonous to thosewho eat its flesh; and yet the danger is quite imperceptibleby reason of any peculiarity in the smell and taste. The sala-mander, too, will poison either water or wine, in which ithappens to be drowned; and what is more, if it has only drunkthereof, the liquid becomes poisonous. The same is the case,too, with the frog known to us as the bramble-frog. So nu-merous are the snares that are laid in wait for life! Waspsgreedily devour the flesh of the serpent, a nutriment whichrenders their stings fatal; so vast is the difference to be foundbetween one kind of food and another. In the country, too,of the Ichthyophagi,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> as we learn from Theophrastus, the oxenare fed upon fish, but only when alive.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">B. ix. c. 33.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or Fish-eaters.</p></body>
