		<h2>
			What is TurtleSheet?
		</h2>
		
		A plotting program based on <a href="http://mathforum.org/sum95/suzanne/basiclogo.html">LogoWriter</a>, integrated with a spreadsheet. 
		
		<h2>
			What can I use it for?
		</h2>
			This is not "just a toy" (my housemate said that). There are many data-driven plots that Excel can't yet draw. 
			<br>
			For example:
			</br>
			Subway maps, Gantt chart, efficiency arrows, circuit diagram, axes, box plot, Venn diagram, traffic simulator, 
			<br>population pyramid, phone tower hexagons, clock timing diagrams, tree graphs, chemistry, timelines...</br>
			
		<h2>
			How do I use it?
		</h2>
		
		<h3>
			Basic operation
		</h3>
		<li>
			Type some Logo code into the <b>Logo Code</b> field on the bottom left. 
		</li>
		<li>
			Click <b>Compile</b>.
		</li>
		<li>
			See the JS equivalent in the <b>JavaScript code</b> field. You can also type directly into here. 
		</li>
		<li>
			Click <b>Run</b>. 
		</li>
		<li>
			See the turtle move in the <b>Drawing</b> area on the top right. 
		</li>
		
		<h3>
			Other buttons
		</h3>
		<li>
			<b>Import</b> takes tab-delimited data from the <b>Import Area</b> and copies it into the spreadsheet. 
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Clear</b> removes all data from the spreadsheet. 
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Save</b> copies the <b>Logo Code</b> field into HTML5 LocalStorage (a kind of cookie). 
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Load</b> brings back a saved program from LocalStorage and puts it into the <b>Logo Code</b> field. 
		</li>
		
		<h3>
			Shortcuts
		</h3>
		<li>
			<b>lt 90</b> turns the turtle left by 90 degrees. 
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>fd 50</b> moves the turtle forward by 50 steps (you might need to zoom out to see this). 
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>rt 90</b> turns the turtle right by 90 degrees.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>cg</b> (clear graphics) clears the <b>Drawing</b> area and moves the turtle back to where it started.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>square</b> draws a square of size 50 pixels.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>railway</b> draws a subway-style map of the train network in Taiwan.
