Man, however, has, in proportion to hisbody, the most voluminous brain of all. This, too, is themost humid, and the coldest of all the viscera, and is enveloped above and below with two membranous integuments,for either of which to be broken is fatal. In addition to thesefacts, we may remark that the brain is larger in men than in<pb n="3048" />women. In man the brain is destitute of blood and veins, andin other animals it has no fat. Those who are well informedon the subject, tell us that the brain is quite a differentsubstance from the marrow, seeing that on being boiled itonly becomes harder. In the very middle of the brain ofevery animal there are small bones found. Man is the only animal in which it is known to palpitate<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> during infancy; andit does not gain its proper consistency until after the child hasmade its first attempt to speak. The brain is the most elevated of all the viscera, and the nearest to the roof of thehead; it is equally devoid of flesh, blood, and excretions. Thesenses hold this organ as their citadel; it is in this thatare centred all the veins which spring from the heart; it ishere that they terminate; this is the very culminating point ofall, the regulator of the understanding. With all animals itis advanced to the fore-part of the head, from the fact thatthe senses have a tendency to the direction in which we look.From the brain proceeds sleep, and its return it is that causesthe head to nod. Those creatures, in fact, which have no brain,never sleep. It is said that stags<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> have in the head certainsmall maggots, twenty in number: they are situate in theempty space that lies beneath the tongue, and around the jointsby which the head is united to the body.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. vii. c. 1.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier says that these are the larv¾ of the Ïstrus, which are depositedon the lips of quadrupeds, and so make their way to various cavities.</p></body>
