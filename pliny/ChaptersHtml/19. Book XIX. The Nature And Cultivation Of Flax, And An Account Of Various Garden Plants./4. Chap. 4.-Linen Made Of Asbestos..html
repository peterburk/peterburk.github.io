<div2 type="chapter" n="4" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 4.—LINEN MADE OF ASBESTOS.</head><p>There has been invented also a kind of linen which isincombustible by flame. It is generally known as "live"<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> linen,and I have seen, before now, napkins<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> that were made of it<pb n="4137" />thrown into a blazing fire, in the room where the guests wereat table, and after the stains were burnt out, come forth fromthe flames whiter and cleaner than they could possibly havebeen rendered by the aid of water. It is from this materialthat the corpse-cloths of monarchs are made, to ensure theseparation of the ashes of the body from those of the pile.This substance grows<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> in the deserts of India,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> scorched bythe burning rays of the sun: here, where no rain is everknown to fall, and amid multitudes of deadly serpents, it becomes habituated to resist the action of fire. Rarely to befound, it presents considerable difficulties in weaving it into atissue, in consequence of its shortness; its colour is naturallyred, and it only becomes white through the agency of fire.By those who find it, it is sold at prices equal to those givenfor the finest pearls; by the Greeks it is called "asbestinon,"<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>a name which indicates its peculiar properties. Anaxilaüs<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>makes a statement to the effect that if a tree is surroundedwith linen made of this substance, the noise of the blowsgiven by the axe will be deadened thereby, and that the tree maybe cut down without their being heard. For these qualities itis that this linen occupies the very highest rank among all thekinds that are known.</p><p>The next rank is accorded to the tissue known as "byssus,"<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>an article which is held in the very highest estimation byfemales, and is produced in the vicinity of Elis, in Achaia.<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> Ifind it stated by some writers that a scruple of this sold for-<pb n="4138" />merly at four denarii, the same rate, in fact, as gold. Thedowny nap of linen, and more particularly that taken fromthe sails of sea-going ships, is very extensively employed formedicinal purposes, and the ashes of it have the same virtuesas spodium.<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> Among the poppies, too,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> there is a variety whichimparts a remarkable degree of whiteness to fabrics made oflinen.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Vivum."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He evidently considers asbestus, or amianthus, to be a vegetable, andnot a mineral production. It is, in reality, a mineral, with long flexiblefilaments, of a silky appearance, and is composed of silica, magnesia, andlime. The wicks of the inextinguishable lamps of the middle ages, theexistence of which was an article of general belief, were said to be madeof asbestus. Paper and lace, even, have been made of it in moderntimes.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Nascitur." In the year <date value="1702" authname="1702">1702</date> there was found near the NævianGate, at Rome, a funereal urn, in which there was a skull, calcined bones,and other ashes, enclosed in a cloth of asbestus, of a marvellous length.It is still preserved in the Vatican.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">On the contrary, it is found in the Higher Alps in the vicinity ofthe Glaciers, in Scotland, and in Siberia, even.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Signifying "inextinguishable," from <foreign lang="greek">a,</foreign> "not," and <foreign lang="greek">sbe/nnumi,</foreign> "toextinguish."
