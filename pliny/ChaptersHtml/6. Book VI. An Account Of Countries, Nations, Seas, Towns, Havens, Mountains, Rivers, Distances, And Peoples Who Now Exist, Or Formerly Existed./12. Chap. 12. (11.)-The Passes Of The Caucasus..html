<div2 type="chapter" n="12" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 12. (11.)—THE PASSES OF THE CAUCASUS.</head><p>After passing the last, we come to the Gates of Caucasus,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>by many persons most erroneously called the Caspian Passes;a vast work of nature, which has suddenly wrenched asunderin this place a chain of mountains. At this spot are gatesbarred up with beams shod with iron, while beneath themiddle there runs a stream which emits a most fetid odour;on this side of it is a rock, defended by a fortress, the name ofwhich is Cumania,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> erected for the purpose of preventing thepassage of the innumerable tribes that lie beyond. Here, then,we may see the habitable world severed into two parts by a pair<pb n="2022" />of gates; they are just opposite to Harmastis, a town of theIberi.</p><p>Beyond the Gates of Caucasus, in the Gordyæan Mountains, the Valli and the Suani, uncivilized tribes, are found;still, however, they work the mines of gold there. Beyondthese nations, and extending as far away as Pontus, are numerous nations of the Heniochi, and, after them, of the Achæi.Such is the present state of one of the most famous tracts uponthe face of the earth.</p><p>Some writers have stated that the distance between theEuxine and the Caspian Sea is not more than three hundredand seventy-five miles; Cornelius Nepos makes it only twohundred and fifty. Within such straits is Asia pent up in thissecond instance<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> by the agency of the sea! Claudius Cæsarhas informed us that from the Cimmerian Bosporus to theCaspian Sea is a distance of only one hundred and fifty<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> miles,and that Nicator Seleucus<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> contemplated cutting through thisisthmus just at the time when he was slain by PtolemyCeraunus. It is a well-known fact that the distance fromthe Gates of Caucasus to the shores of the Euxine is twohundred miles.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There are two chief passes over the chain of the Caucasus, both ofwhich were known to the ancients. The first is between the easternextremity of its chief north-eastern spur and the Caspian sea, near themodern Derbend. This was called "Albaniæ," and sometimes, "CaspiæPylie," the "Albanian" or "Caspian Gates." The other, which wasnearly in the centre of the Caspian range, was called "Caucasiæ" or"Sarmaticæ Pylæ," being the same as the modern pass of Dariyel, andprobably the one here referred to.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably the same as the present fortress of Dariyel.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The first instance was that of the narrow isthmus to which the continent of Asia is reduced from Sinope across to the Gulf of Issus, as mentioned in c. 2.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The shortest distance across, in a straight line, is in reality little lessthan 600 miles.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The ancestor of the Seleucidæ, kings of Syria, treacherously slain byPtolemy Ceraunus, brother of Ptolemy Philadelphus.</p></body>
