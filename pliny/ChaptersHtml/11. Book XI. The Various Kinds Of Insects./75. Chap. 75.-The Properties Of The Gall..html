Hence it is, too,that the word " bile" has been employed by us to characterizea harsh, embittered disposition; so powerful are the effectsof this secretion, when it extends its influence to the mind.In addition to this, when it is dispersed over the whole ofthe body, it deprives the eyes, even, of their natural colour;and when ejected, will tarnish copper vessels even, renderingeverything black with which it comes in contact; so that noone ought to be surprised that it is the gall which constitutesthe venom of serpents. Those animals of Pontus which feedon wormwood have no gall: in the raven, the quail, and thepheasant, the gall-bladder is united to the renal parts, and, onone side only, to the intestines. In many animals, again, itis united only to the intestines, the pigeon, the hawk, and themurena, for example. In some few birds it is situate in theliver; but it is in serpents and fishes that it is the largest inproportion. With the greater part of birds, it extends all alongthroughout the intestines, as in the hawk and the kite. Insome other birds, also, it is situate in the breast as well: thegall, too, of the sea-calf is celebrated for its application to manypurposes. From the gall of the bull a colour is extracted likethat of gold. The aruspices have consecrated the gall to Neptune and the influence of water. The Emperor Augustusfound a double gall in a victim which he was sacrificing onthe day of his victory at Actium.<pb n="3070" /></p></div2></body>
