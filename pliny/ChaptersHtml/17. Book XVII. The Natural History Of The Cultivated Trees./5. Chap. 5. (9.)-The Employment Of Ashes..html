(9.)ÑTHE EMPLOYMENT OF ASHES.</head><p>The agriculturists of the parts of Italy beyond the river<pb n="3456" />Padus, are such admirers of ashes<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> for this purpose, that theyeven prefer it as a manure to the dung of beasts of burden;indeed, they are in the habit of burning dung for this purpose, on account of its superior lightness. They do not, however, use them indiscriminately upon the same soil, nor dothey employ ashes for promoting the growth of shrubs, nor, infact, of some of the cereals, as we shall have occasion<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> tomention hereafter. There are some persons who are of opinionalso that dust<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> imparts nutriment to grapes, and cover themwith it while they are growing, taking care to throw it alsoupon the roots of the vines and other trees. It is wellknown that this is done in the province of Gallia Narbonensis,and it is a fact even better ascertained that the grape ripensall the sooner for it; indeed, the dust there contributes moreto its ripeness than the heat of the sun.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Though ashes fertilize the ground, more particularly when of an ar-gillaceous nature, they are not so extensively used now as in ancient times.Pliny alludes here more particularly to wood and dunghill ashes.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This, however, he omits to do.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He alludes, probably, to Theophrastus, De Causis, B. iii. c. 22.</p></body>
