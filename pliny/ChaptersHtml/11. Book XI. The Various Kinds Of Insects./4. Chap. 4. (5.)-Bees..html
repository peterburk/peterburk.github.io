(5.)ÑBEES.</head><p>But among them all, the first rank, and our especial admiration, ought, in justice, to be accorded to bees, which alone,of all the insects, have been created for the benefit of man.They extract honey and collect it, a juicy substance remarkablefor its extreme sweetness, lightness, and wholesomeness. Theyform their combs and collect wax, an article that is useful fora thousand purposes of life; they are patient of fatigue, toil attheir labours, form themselves into political communities, holdcouncils together in private, elect chiefs in common, and, a thingthat is the most remarkable of all, have their own code of morals.In addition to this, being as they are, neither tame nor wild,so all-powerful is Nature, that, from a creature so minute as tobe nothing more hardly than the shadow of an animal, she hascreated a marvel beyond all comparison. What muscularpower, what exertion of strength are we to put in comparisonwith such vast energy and such industry as theirs? What display of human genius, in a word, shall we compare with thereasoning powers manifested by them? In this they have, atall events, the advantage of us-they know of nothing but whatis for the common benefit of all. Away, then, with all questionswhether they respire or no, and let us be ready to agree onthe question of their blood; and yet, how little of it can possibly exist in bodies so minute as theirs.ÑAnd now let usform some idea of the instinct they display.</p></div2></body>
