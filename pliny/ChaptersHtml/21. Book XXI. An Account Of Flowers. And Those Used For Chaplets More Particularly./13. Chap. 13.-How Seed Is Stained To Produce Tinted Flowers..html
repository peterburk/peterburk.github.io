By this method purple lilies areobtained, it being a very remarkable thing that we should beable to dye a plant to such a degree as to make it produce acoloured flower.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">FŽe remarks, that the extravagant proceeding here described byPliny with a seriousness that is perfectly ridiculous, does not merit anydiscussion.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">When detached from the bulb, the stem of the lily will infallibly die.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Nudantibus se nodulis."
