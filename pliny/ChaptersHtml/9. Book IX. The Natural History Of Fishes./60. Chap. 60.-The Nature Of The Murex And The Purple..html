<div2 type="chapter" n="60" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 60.—THE NATURE OF THE MUREX AND THE PURPLE.</head><p>And yet pearls may be looked upon as pretty nearly a possession of everlasting duration—they descend from a man tohis heir, and they are alienated from one to another just likeany landed estate. But the colours that are extracted fromthe murex<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and the purple fade from hour to hour; and yetluxury, which has similarly acted as a mother to them, hasset upon them prices almost equal to those of pearls.<pb n="2442" /></p><p>(36.) Purples live mostly seven<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> years. Like the murex,they keep themselves in concealment for thirty days, about thetime of the rising of the Dog-star; in the spring season they unitein large bodies, and by rubbing against each other, produce aviscous spittle, from which a kind of wax is formed. Themurex does the same; but the purple<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> has that exquisitejuice which is so greatly sought after for the purpose of dyeingcloth, situate in the middle of the throat. This secretionconsists of a tiny drop contained in a white vein, from whichthe precious liquid used for dyeing is distilled, being of thetint of a rose somewhat inclining to black. The rest of thebody is entirely destitute of this juice. It is a great point totake the fish alive; for when it dies, it spits out this juice.From the larger ones it is extracted after taking off the shell;but the small fish are crushed alive, together with the shells,upon which they eject this secretion.</p><p>In Asia the best purple is that of Tyre, in Africa thatof Meninx<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and the parts of Gætulia that border on theOcean, and in Europe that of Laconia. It is for this colourthat the fasces and the axes<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> of Rome make way in thecrowd; it is this that asserts the majesty of childhood;<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> it isthis that distinguishes the senator<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> from the man of equestrianrank; by persons arrayed in this colour are prayers<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> ad-<pb n="2443" />dressed to propitiate the gods; on every garment<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> it sheds alustre, and in the triumphal vestment<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> it is to be seen mingled with gold. Let us be prepared then to excuse thisfrantic passion for purple, even though at the same time weare compelled to enquire, why it is that such a high value hasbeen set upon the produce of this shell-fish, seeing that whilein the dye the smell of it is offensive, and the colour itselfis harsh, of a greenish hue, and strongly resembling that ofthe sea when in a tempestuous state?</p><p>The tongue of the purple is a finger<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> in length, and bymeans of this it finds subsistence, by piercing other shellfish,<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> so hard is the point of it. They die in fresh water, andin places where rivers discharge themselves into the sea;otherwise, when taken, they will live as long as fifty days ontheir saliva. All shell-fish grow very fast, and purples moreespecially; they come to their full size at the end of a year.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "conchylium." We find that Pliny generally makes a differencebetween the colours of the "murex," or "conchylium," and those of the"purpura," or "purple." Cuvier says, that they were the names of different shell-fish which the ancients employed for dyeing in purple ofvarious shades. It is not known exactly, at the present day, what speciesthey employed; but it is a fact well ascertained, that the greater part ofthe univalve shell-fish, more especially the Buccini and Murices of Linnæus, distil a kind of red liquid. The dearness of it arose, Cuvier thinks,from the remarkably small quantity that each animal afforded. Since thecoccus, or kermes, he says, came to be well known, and more especiallysince the New World has supplied us with cochineal, we are no longernecessitated to have recourse to the juices of the murex.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. v. c. 14, says, "about six." The murex ofPliny is the <foreign lang="greek">kh/ruc</foreign> of Aristotle.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle says, that the purple consists of three parts, the upper beingthe <foreign lang="greek">tra/xhlos,</foreign> or neck; the middle the <foreign lang="greek">mh/xwn,</foreign>, or poppy; and the lowerthe <foreign lang="greek">puqmh/n,</foreign> or trunk; and that the juice lies between the first and secondof these parts, or the throat. This juice, which Pliny calls "flos,""flower," "ros," "dew," and "succus," "juice," is distilled, Cuviersays, not from the fauces of the animal, but from the mantle or membranous tissue which lines the shell.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. v. c. 7.

It is much moreprobable that by these words Pliny means the "majesty of youth," in itssimplicity and guileless nature, that commands our veneration and respect.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He means that the purple laticlave or broad hem of the senator's togadistinguished him from the eques, who wore a toga with an angusticlave,or narrow hem.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From Cicero, Epist. Ad. Attic. B. ii. Ep. 9, we learn that purplewas worn by the priests when performing sacrifice. Ajasson, however,agrees with Dalechamps in thinking that this passage bears reference tothe consuls, who wore purple when sacrificing to the gods.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The prætexta, for instance, the laticlave, the chlamys, the paludamentum, and the trabea.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">On the occasion of a triumph, the victor was arrayed in a "togapicta," an embroidered garment, which, from the present passage, wouldappear to have been of purple and gold. Pliny tells us, B. xxxiii. c. 19,that Tarquinius, on his triumph over the Sabines, wore a robe of cloth ofgold.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle says the same, Hist. Anim. B. v. c. 14, and De Partib.Anim. B. ii. c. 17. Cuvier says, that the buccinus and murex have a longneck, in which there is a tongue armed with little teeth, but very sharp,by means of which the animal is enabled to pierce other shell-fish.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Conchylia;" other fish of the same kind apparently; as Pliny usesthe word "conchylium" synonymously with "murex."</p></body>
