<div2 type="chapter" n="40" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 40.—THE TITHYMALOS MYRTITES, OR CARYITES; TWENTY-ONE REMEDIES.</head><p>A second kind of tithymalos is called "myrtites"<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> by somepersons, and "caryites" by others. It has leaves like thoseof myrtle, pointed and prickly, but with a softer surface, andgrows, like the one already mentioned, in rugged soils. Thetufted heads of it are gathered just as barley is beginning toswell in the ear, and, after being left for nine days in the shade,are thoroughly dried in the sun. The fruit does not ripen all at<pb n="5179" />once, some, indeed, not till the ensuing year. The name given tothis fruit is the "nut," whence the Greek appellation "caryites."<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> It is gathered at harvest, and is washed and dried, beinggiven with twice the quantity of black poppy, in doses of oneacetabulum in all.</p><p>As an emetic, this kind is not so efficacious as the precedingone, and, indeed, the same may be said of all the others. Somephysicians recommend the leaf to be taken in the manneralready mentioned, but say that the nut should either be takenin honied wine or raisin wine, or else with sesame. It carriesoff pituitous humours and bile by stool, and is curative of ulcerations of the mouth. For corrosive sores of the mouth,the leaf is eaten with honey.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Euphorbia myrsinites of Linnæus.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From the Greek <foreign lang="greek">ka/ruon,</foreign>, a "nut."</p></body>
