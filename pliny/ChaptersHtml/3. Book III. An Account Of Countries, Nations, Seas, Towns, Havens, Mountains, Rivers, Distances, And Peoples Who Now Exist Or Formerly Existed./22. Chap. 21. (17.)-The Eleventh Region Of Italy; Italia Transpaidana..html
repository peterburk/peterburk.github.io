<div2 type="chapter" n="21" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 21. (17.)—THE ELEVENTH REGION OF ITALY; ITALIA TRANSPAIDANA.</head><p>From the river Padus the eleventh region receives itsname of Transpadana; to which, situate as it is wholly inthe interior, the river, by its bounteous channel, conveysthe gifts of all the seas. The towns are Vibî Forum<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and<pb n="1247" />Segusio; and, at the foot of the Alps, the colony of AugustaTaurinorum<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>, at which place the Padus becomes navigable,and which was founded by the ancient race of the Ligurians,and of Augusta Prætoria<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> of the Salassi, near the two passesof the Alps, the Grecian<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and the Penine (by the latter it issaid that the Carthaginians passed into Italy, by the Grecian,Hercules)—the town of Eporedia<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>, the foundation of whichby the Roman people was enjoined by the Sibylline books;the Gauls call tamers of horses by the name of "Epore-diæ"—Vercellæ<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>, the town of the Libici, derived its originfrom the Salluvii, and Novaria<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>, founded by the Vertacoma-cori, is at the present day a district of the Vocontii, and not,as Cato supposes, of the Ligurians; of whom two nations,called the Lævi and the Marici, founded Ticinum<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>, not farfrom the Padus, as the Boii, descended from the Transalpinenations, have founded Laus Pompeia<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> and the Insubres Me-diolanum<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>.<pb n="1248" /></p><p>From Cato we also learn that Comum, Bergomum<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>, andLicinîforum<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>, and some other peoples in the vicinity, originated with the Orobii, but he admits that he is ignorant asto the origin of that nation. Cornelius Alexander howeverinforms us that they came from Greece, interpreting theirname as meaning "those who live upon the mountains<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>."In this district, Parra has disappeared, a town of the Orobii,from whom, according to Cato, the people of Bergomum aredescended; its site even yet shows that it was situate in aposition more elevated than fruitful<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>. The Caturiges havealso perished, an exiled race of the Insubres, as also Spinapreviously mentioned; Melpum too, a place distinguishedfor its opulence, which, as we are informed by CorneliusNepos, was destroyed by the Insubres, the Boii, and theSenones, on the very day on which Camillus took Veii.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This place is supposed to have been situate in the vicinity of the modern Saluzzo, on the north bank of the Po. Segusio occupied the site of the modern Susa.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Augusta of the Taurini. The present city of Turin stands on its site. It was made a Roman colony by Augustus. With the exception of some inscriptions, Turin retains no vestiges of antiquity.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The present city of Aosta occupies its site. This was also a Roman colony founded by Augustus, after he had subdued the Salassi. It was, as Pliny says in C. 5, the extreme point of Italy to the north. The remains of the ancient city are of extreme magnificence.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Grecian pass of the Alps was that now known as the Little St. Bernard; while the Penine pass was the present Great St. Bernard. Livy in his History, B. xxi. c. 38, points out the error of taking these mountains to have derived their name from the Pœni or Carthaginians. There is no doubt that they took their name from the Celtic word signi fying a mountain, which now forms the "Pen" of the Welsh and the "Ben" of the Scotch.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called Ivrea or Lamporeggio, at the entrance of the valley of the Salassi, the present Val d'Aosta. There are some remains of the ancient town to be seen.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The present town of Vercelli stands on its site.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called Novara, in the Duchy of Milan.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It became a Roman municipal town, but owes its greatness to the Lombard kings who made it their capital, and altered the name to Papia, now Pavia.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pompey's Praises." The present Lodi Vecchio marks its site.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It was the capital of the Insubres, a Gallic nation, and was taken by the Romans in B.C. <date value="-222" authname="-222">222</date>, on which it became a municipium and Roman colony. On the division of the empire by Diocletian, it became the residence of his colleague Maximianus, and continued to be the abode of the Emperors of the West till it was plundered by Attila, who transferred the seat of government to Ravenna. It afterwards became the capital of the kingdom of the Ostro-Goths, and was again sacked by the Goths in A.D. <date value="539" authname="539">539</date>, and its inhabitants put to the sword. The present city, known to us as Milan, contains no remains of antiquity.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The modern Como and Bergamo stand on their sites.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From its name, signifying the "market of Licinius," it would appear to be of Roman origin. Its site is supposed to have been at a place called Incino, near the town of Erba, between Como and Lecco, where inscriptions and other antiquities have been found.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Deriving it from the Greek <foreign lang="greek">o)/ros,</foreign> "a mountain," and <foreign lang="greek">bi/os,</foreign> "life."</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Etiamnum prodente se altius quam fortunatius situm." Hardouin seems to think that "se" refers to Cato, and that he informs us to that effect; but to all appearance, it relates rather to the town, which even yet, by its ruins, showed that it was perched too high among the mountains to be a fertile spot.</p></body>
