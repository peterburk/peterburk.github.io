<div2 type="chapter" n="1" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 1. (1.)—INTRODUCTION.</head><p>WE should have now concluded our description of the variousthings<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> that are produced between the heavens and the earth,and it would have only remained for us to speak of the substances that are dug out of the ground itself; did not our exposition of the remedies derived from plants and shrubs necessarily lead us into a digression upon the medicinal propertieswhich have been discovered, to a still greater extent, in thoseliving creatures themselves which are thus indebted [to otherobjects] for the cure of their respective maladies. For ought we,after describing the plants, the forms of the various flowers, andso many objects rare and difficult to be found—ought we to passin silence the resources which exist in man himself for thebenefit of man, and the other remedies to be derived from thecreatures that live among us—and this more particularly,seeing that life itself is nothing short of a punishment, unlessit is exempt from pains and maladies? Assuredly not; andeven though I may incur the risk of being tedious, I shallexert all my energies on the subject, it being my fixed determination to pay less regard to what may be amusing, than towhat may prove practically useful to mankind.</p><p>Nay, even more than this, my researches will extend to theusages of foreign countries, and to the customs of barbarousnations, subjects upon which I shall have to appeal to thegood faith of other authors; though at the same time I havemade it my object to select no<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> facts but such as are established<pb n="5276" />by pretty nearly uniform testimony, and to pay more attentionto scrupulous exactness than to copiousness of diction.</p><p>It is highly necessary, however, to advertise the reader, thatwhereas I have already described the natures of the variousanimals, and the discoveries<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> due to them respectively—for, infact, they have been no less serviceable in former times in dis-covering remedies, than they are at the present day in providing us with them—it is my present intention to confine myselfto the remedial properties which are found in the animalworld, a subject which has not been altogether lost sight of inthe former portion of this work. These additional detailstherefore, though of a different nature, must still be read inconnexion with those which precede.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The trees and plants.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">On the contrary, this and the four following Books are full of the mostextravagant assertions, which bear ample testimony to his credulity, not-withstanding the author's repeated declarations that he does not believe inMagic. As Ajasson says, he evidently does not know what he ought tohave inserted in his work, and what to reject as utterly unworthy of belief.His faults, however, were not so much his own as those of his age. Wantof space, equally with want of inclination, compels us to forego the task ofentering into an examination of the system of Animal Therapeaties upon.which so much labour has been waste by our author.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. viii. c. 97, <hi rend="ital">et seq.,</hi> and B. xxv. c. 89, <hi rend="ital">et seq.</hi></p></body>
