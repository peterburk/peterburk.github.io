<div2 type="chapter" n="29" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 29.—THE QUALITIES OF WATER AT THE DIFFERENT SEASONSOF THE YEAR.</head><p>Every kind of water is freshest in winter, not so fresh in<pb n="5492" />summer, still less so in autumn, and least of all in times of drought.River-water, too, is by no means always the same in taste, thestate of the bed over which it runs making a considerabledifference. For the quality of water, in fact, depends upon thenature of the soil through which it flows, and the juices<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> ofthe vegetation watered by it; hence it is that the water of thesame river is found in some spots to be comparatively unwholesome. The confluents, too, of rivers, are apt to change theflavour of the water, impregnating the stream in which theyare lost and absorbed; as in the case of the Borysthenes, forexample. In some instances, again, the taste of river-water ischanged by the fall of heavy rains. It has happened threetimes in the Bosporus that there has been a fall of salt rain, aphænomenon which proved fatal to the crops. On three occasions, also, the rains have imparted a bitterness to the overflowing streams of the Nilus, which was productive of greatpestilence throughout Egypt.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. ii. c. 106.</p></body>
