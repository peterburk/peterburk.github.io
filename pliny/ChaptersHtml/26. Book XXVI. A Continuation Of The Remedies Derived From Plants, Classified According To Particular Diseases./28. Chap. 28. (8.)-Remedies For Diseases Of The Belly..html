(8.)—REMEDIES FOR DISEASES OF THE BELLY.</head><p>But it is the belly, for the gratification of which the greaterpart of mankind exist, that causes the most suffering to man.Thus, for instance, at one time it will not allow the alimentsto pass, while at another it is unable to retain them. Sometimes, again, it either cannot receive the food, or, if it can,cannot digest it; indeed, such are the excesses practised atthe present day, that it is through his aliment, more than anything else, that man hastens his end. This receptacle,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> moretroublesome to us than any other part of the body, is ever craving,like some importunate creditor, and makes its calls repeatedlyin the day. It is for its sake, more particularly, that avariceis so insatiate, for its sake that luxury is so refined,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> for its sakethat men voyage to the shores even of the Phasis, for its sakethat the very depths of the ocean are ransacked. And yet,with all this, no one ever gives a thought how abject is thecondition of this part of our body, how disgusting the resultsof its action upon what it has received! No wonder then,<pb n="5170" />that the belly should have to be indebted to the aid of medicinein the very highest degree</p><p>Scordotis,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> fresh-gathered and beaten up, in doses of onedrachma, with wine, arrests flux of the bowels; an effectequally produced by a decoction of it taken in drink.

For cœliac affections, betony is taken inastringent wine, or iberis is applied topically, as alrealdy<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>stated. For tenesmus, root of nymphæa heraclia is taken inwine, or else psyllion<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> in water, or a decoction of root ofacoron.<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> Juice of aizoüm<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> arrests diarrhœa and dysentery, andexpels round tape-worm.
