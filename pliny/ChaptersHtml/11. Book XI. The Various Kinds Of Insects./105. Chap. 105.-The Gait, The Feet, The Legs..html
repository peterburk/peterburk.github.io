While the otheranimals walk just as it may happen, the lion only and thecamel walk foot by foot, or in such a way that the left footnever passes the right, but always comes behind it. Men havethe largest feet; in every kind of animal the female has thesmallest. Man only<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> has calves, and flesh upon the legs: wefind it stated by authors, however, that there was once anEgyptian who had no calves on his legs. All men, too, withsome few exceptions, have a sole to the foot. It is from theseexceptional cases that persons have obtained the names ofPlancus,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> Plautus, Pansa, and Scaurus; just as, from the malformation of the legs, we find persons called Varus,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> Vacia, andVatinius, all which blemishes are to be seen in quadrupedsalso. Animals which have no horns have a solid hoof, fromwhich circumstance it is used by them as a weapon of offence,in place of horns; such animals as these are also destitute of pastern bones, but those which have cloven hoofshave them; while those, again, which have toes have none,nor are they ever found in the fore-feet of animals. Thecamel has pastern bones like those of the ox, but somewhatsmaller, the feet being cloven, with a slight line of division,and having a fleshy sole, like that of the bear: hence it is,that in a long journey, the animal becomes fatigued, and thefoot cracks, if it is not shod.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The frog is, in some measure, an exception.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "flat-foot," "splay-foot," "large-foot," and "club-footed."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Words meaning "knock-kneed," "bow-legged," and "wry-legged."</p></body>
