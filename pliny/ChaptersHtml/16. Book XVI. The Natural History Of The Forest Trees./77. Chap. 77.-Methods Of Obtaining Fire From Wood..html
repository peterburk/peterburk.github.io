<div2 type="chapter" n="77" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 77.—METHODS OF OBTAINING FIRE FROM WOOD.</head><p>This is a method<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> which has been employed by the outpostsof armies, and by shepherds, on occasions when there has notbeen a stone at hand to strike fire with. Two pieces of woodare rubbed briskly together, and the friction soon sets them onfire; which is caught on dry and inflammable substances, fun-guses and leaves being found to ignite the most readily. Thereis nothing superior to the wood of the ivy for rubbing against,<pb n="3422" />or to that of the laurel for rubbing with. A species of wildvine,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> too—not the same as the labrusca—which climbs upother trees like the ivy, is highly approved of. The coldest<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>woods of all are those of the aquatic trees; but they are themost flexible also, and for that reason the best adapted for theconstruction of bucklers. On an incision being made in them,they will contract immediately, and so close up their wounds,at the same time rendering it more difficult for the iron to penetrate: in the number of these woods are the fig, the willow,the lime, the birch, the elder, and both varieties of the poplar.</p><p>The lightest of all these woods, and consequently the mostuseful, are the fig and the willow. They are all of them employed, however, in the manufacture of baskets and otherutensils of wicker-work; while, at the same time, they possess a degree of whiteness and hardness which render themvery well adapted for carving. The plane has considerableflexibility, but it is moist and slimy like the alder. The elm,too, the ash, the mulberry, and the cherry, are flexible, but ofa drier nature; the wood, however, is more weighty. Theelm is the best of all for retaining its natural toughness, andhence it is more particularly employed for socket beams forhinges, and cases for the pannelling of doors, being proofagainst warping. It is requisite, however, that the beam toreceive the hinge should be inverted when set up, the top ofthe tree answering to the lower hinge, the root to the upper.The wood of the palm and the cork-tree is soft, while that ofthe apple and the pear is compact. Such, however, is not thecase with the maple, its wood being brittle, as, in fact, allveined woods are. In every kind of tree, the varieties in thewood are still more augmented by the wild trees and the males.The wood, too, of the barren tree is more solid than that of thefruit-bearing ones, except in those species in which the maletrees<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> bear fruit, the cypress and the cornel, for instance.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The savages of North America, and, indeed, of all parts of the globe,seem to have been acquainted with this method of kindling fire from thevery earliest times.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxiv. c. 49.
