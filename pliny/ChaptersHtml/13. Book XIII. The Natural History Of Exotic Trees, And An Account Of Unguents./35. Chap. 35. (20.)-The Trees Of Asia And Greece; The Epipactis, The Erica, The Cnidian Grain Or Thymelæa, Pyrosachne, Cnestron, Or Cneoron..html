(20.)ÑTHE TREES OF ASIA AND GREECE; THE EPIPACTIS,THE ERICA, THE CNIDIAN GRAIN OR THYMEL®A, PYROSACHNE,CNESTRON, OR CNEORON.</head><p>In Asia and Greece are produced the following shrubs, theepipactis,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> by some known as "elleborine," the leaves ofwhich are of small size, and when taken in drink, are anantidote against poison; just in the same way that those ofthe erica<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> are a specific against the sting of the serpent.</p><p>(21.) Here is also found another shrub, upon which growsthe grain of Cnidos,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> by some known as "linum;" the nameof the shrub itself being thymel¾a,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> while others, again, call it"chamel¾a,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> others pyrosachne, others cnestron, and otherscneorum; it bears a strong resemblance to the wild olive, buthas a narrow leaf, which has a gummy taste in the mouth.The shrub is of about the size of the myrtle; its seed is of thesame colour and appearance, but is solely used for medicinalpurposes.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxvii. c. 52. Sprengel thinks that this is the Neottia spiralisof Schwartz; but FŽe is of opinion that it has not hitherto been identified.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably the Erica arborea of Linn¾us, or "heath" in its severalvarieties.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Granum Cnidium. The shrub is the Daphne Cnidium of Linn¾us.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The "thyme-olive."</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The "ground olive," or "small olive." Dioscorides makes a distinction between these two last; and Sprengel has followed it, naming thelast Daphne Cnidium, and the first Daphne Cneorum.</p></body>
