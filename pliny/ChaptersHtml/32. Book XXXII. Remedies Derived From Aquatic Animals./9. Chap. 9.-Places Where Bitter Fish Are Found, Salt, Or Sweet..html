<div2 type="chapter" n="9" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 9.—PLACES WHERE BITTER FISH ARE FOUND, SALT, OR SWEET.</head><p>Nor is it by any means the least surprising fact, that off theisland of Pele,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> the town of Clazomenæ,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> the rock<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> [ofScylla] in Sicily, and in the vicinity of Leptis in Africa,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>Eubœa, and Dyrrhachium,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> the fish are bitter. In the neighbourhoodof Cephallenia, Ampelos, Paros, and the rocks ofDelos, the fish are so salt by nature that they might easily betaken to have been pickled in brine. In the harbour, again,of the last-mentioned island, the fish are sweet: differences,all of them, resulting, no doubt, from the diversity<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> of theirfood.</p><p>Apion says that the largest among the fishes is the seapig,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>known to the Lacedæmonians as the "orthagoriscos;"<pb n="6010" />he states also that it grunts<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> like a hog when taken. Theseaccidental varieties in the natural flavour of fish—a thing thatis still more surprising—may, in some cases, be owing to thenature of the locality; an apposite illustration of which is, thewell-known fact that, at Beneventum<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> in Italy, salted provisionsof all kinds require<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> to be salted over again.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. v. c. 38.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. v. c. 31, and B. xxxi. c. 43.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. iii. c. 14.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. v. cc. 3, 4.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. iii. cc. 16, 26.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ajasson thinks that this may possibly be true to some small extent.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Identical with the fish called "orbis," already mentioned in c. 5 ofthis Book.
