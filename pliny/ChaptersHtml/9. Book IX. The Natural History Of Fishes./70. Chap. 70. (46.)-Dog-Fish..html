<div2 type="chapter" n="70" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 70. (46.)—DOG-FISH. <span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span></head><p>Vast numbers of dog-fish infest the seas in the vicinity ofthe sponges, to the great peril of those who dive for them.These persons say that a sort of dense cloud gradually thickensover their<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> heads, bearing the resemblance of some kind of<pb n="2457" />animal like a flat-fish,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and that, pressing downward upon them,it prevents them from returning to the surface. It is for thisreason that they carry stilettos with them,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> which are verysharp at the point, and attached to them by strings; for if theydid not pierce the object with the help of these, it could notbe got rid of. This, however, is entirely the result, in myopinion, of the darkness and their own fears; for no personhas ever yet been able to find, among living creatures, the fish-cloud or the fish-fog, the name which they give to this enemyof theirs.</p><p>The divers, however, have terrible combats with the dogfish, which attack with avidity the groin, the heels, and allthe whiter parts of the body. The only means of ensuringsafety, is to go boldly to meet them, and so, by taking theinitiative, strike them with alarm: for, in fact, this animalis just as frightened at man, as man is at it; and they are onquite an equal footing when beneath the water. But the moment the diver has reached the surface, the danger is muchmore imminent; for he loses the power of boldly meeting hisadversary while he is endeavouring to make his way out of thewater, and his only chance of safety is in his companions, whodraw him along by a cord that is fastened under his shoulders.While he is engaging with the enemy, he keeps pulling thiscord with his left hand, according as there may be any sign ofimmediate peril, while with the right he wields the stiletto,which he is using in his defence. At first they draw him alongat a moderate pace, but as soon as ever they have got him closeto the ship, if they do not whip him out in an instant, withthe greatest possible celerity, they see him snapped asunder;and many a time, too, the diver, even when already drawnout, is dragged from their hands, through neglecting to aid theefforts of those who are assisting him, by rolling up his bodyin the shape of a ball. The others, it is true, are in the meantime brandishing their pronged fish-spears; but the monsterhas the craftiness to place himself beneath the ship, and so<pb n="2458" />wage the warfare in safety. Consequently, every possiblecare is taked by the divers to look out<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> for the approach ofthis enemy.</p><p>(47.) It is the surest sign of safety to see flat-fish, whichnever frequent the spots where these noxious monsters arefound: and it is for this reason that the divers<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> call them sacred.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is pretty clear that under the name of "canicula," "dog-fish," or"canis marinus," "sea-dog," Pliny includes the whole genus of sharks.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Rondelet and Dalechamps absolutely interpret this passage as thoughit were the dog-fish and flat-fish over whose eyes this cloud comes, andthe latter proceeds to describe it as a malady which hinders the fish fromtaking its own part in the combat. Hardouin, however, detects thisabsurdity, and justly reprehends it; though it must be confessed that thereis some obscurity in the passage, arising from the way in which it isworded.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier thinks it not improbable that it may have been some of thelarge rays that were seen by the divers, and more especially, the largest ofthem all, the Cephalopterus.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Stilos."</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cælius Rhodigonus, B. xxv. c. 16, states that the divers for spongeswere in the habit of pouring forth oil at the bottom of the sea, for thepurpose of increasing the light there; and Pliny states the same in B. ii.c. 106.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier says, that the name of "sacred fish" has been given to severalfish of very different character; such as the anthias or aulopias of Aristotle, B. ix. c. 37, the pompilus and the dolphin (Atheneus, B. vii.), because it was thought that their presence was a guarantee against thevicinity of dangerous fish. The authors, however, that were consulted byPliny, seem to have given this name to the flat-fish, the Pleuronectes ofLinnæus; and in fact, unprovided as they are with any means of defence,their presence is not unlikely to prove, in a very great degree, the absenceof the voracious class of fishes.</p></body>
