(22.)—OF THE HARMONY OF THE STARS.</head><p>Pythagoras, employing the terms that are used in music,sometimes names the distance between the Earth and theMoon a tone; from her to Mercury he supposes to be halfthis space, and about the same from him to Venus. Fromher to the Sun is a tone and a half; from the Sun to Mars isa tone, the same as from the Earth to the Moon; from himthere is half a tone to Jupiter, from Jupiter to Saturn also<pb n="1053" />half a tone, and thence a tone and a half to the zodiac.Hence there are seven tones, which he terms the diapasonharmony<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>, meaning the whole compass of the notes. Inthis, Saturn is said to move in the Doric time, Jupiter in thePhrygian<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>, and so forth of the rest; but this is a refinementrather amusing than useful.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"<foreign lang="greek">Dia\ pasw=n,</foreign> omnibus tonis contextam harmoniam."

The Abbé Barthelemi informs us, that "the Doriansexecuted the same air a tone lower than the Phrygians, and the latter atone still higher than the Lydians; hence the denomination of the Dorian,Phrygian, and Lydian modes." It appears to have been a general practice to employ the lowest modes for the slowest airs; Anacharsis's Travels,iii. 73, 74.</p></body>
