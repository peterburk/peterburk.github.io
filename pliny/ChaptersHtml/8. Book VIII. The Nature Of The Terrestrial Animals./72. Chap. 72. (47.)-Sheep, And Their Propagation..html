(47.)ÑSHEEP, AND THEIR PROPAGATION. <span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span></head><p>Many thanks, too, do we owe to the sheep, both for appeasing the gods, and for giving us the use of its fleece. Asoxen cultivate the fields which yield food for man, so to sheepare we indebted for the defence of our bodies. The generativepower lasts in both sexes from the second to the ninth year,sometimes to the tenth.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> The lambs produced at the firstbirth are but small. The season for coupling, in all of them,is from the setting of Arcturus, that is to say, the third daybefore the ides of May,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> to the setting of Aquila, the tenthday before the calends of August.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> The period of gestation isone hundred and fifty days. The lambs that are producedafter this time are feeble; the ancients called those that wereborn after it, cordi.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> Many persons prefer the lambs thatare born in the winter to those of the spring, because it isof much more consequence that they should have gainedstrength before the summer solstice than before the winterone; consequently, the sheep is the only animal that is bene-fitted by being born in the middle of winter. It is the nature of<pb n="2332" />the ram to reject the young and prefer the old ones, and he himself is more serviceable when old,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> and when deprived of hishorns.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> He is also rendered less violent by having one hornpierced towards the ear. If the right testicle is tied up, theram will generate females, and if the left, males.<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> The noise ofthunder produces abortion in sheep, if they are left alone; toprevent such accidents, they are brought together into flocks,that they may be rendered less timid by being in company.When the north-east wind blows, males are said to be conceived;and when the south wind, females. In this kind of animal,the mouth of the ram is especially looked to, for whatever maybe the colour of the veins under the tongue, the wool of theyoung one will be of a similar colour.<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> If these veins aremany in number, it will be mottled. Any change, too, in theirwater or drink, will render them mottled.<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span></p><p>There are two principal kinds of sheep, the covered<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> andthe colonic,<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> or common sheep; the former is the more tenderanimal, but the latter is more nice about its pastures, for the<pb n="2333" />covered sheep will feed on brambles even. The best coveringsfor sheep are brought from Arabia.<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The contents of this Chapter appear to be principally from Varro, B.ii. cc. 1, 2, and Columella, B. vii. cc. 2, 3, 4.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This account is probably from Aristotle, Hist.

It is also referred toby Aristotle, De Gen. Anim. B. iv. c. 1.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">For this we have the authority of Aristotle, <hi rend="ital">ubi supra,</hi> and of Columella, <hi rend="ital">ubi supra,</hi> who quotes from Virgil in support of it, Geor. B. iii. 1.387, <hi rend="ital">et seq.ÑB.</hi> "Although the-ram be white himself, if there is a blacktongue beneath the palate, reject him, that he may not tinge the fleece ofthe young with black spots."</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Varro, B. ii. c. 2, remarks, "While the coupling is taking place, youmust use the same water; for if it is changed, it will render the woolspotted, and injure the womb."</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Tect¾." The context shows that this means covered with skins ora woollen girth, probably on account of their delicate nature, while thecommon sheep of husbandry, or the "colonic" sheep, were able to endurethe rigour of the weather without any such protection.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The words are <hi rend="ital">tectun</hi> and <hi rend="ital">colonicum;</hi> Columella, B. vii. c. 4, uses theterms <hi rend="ital">molle</hi> and <hi rend="ital">hirsutum,</hi> and Varro, B. ii. c. 2, <hi rend="ital">pellitum</hi> and <hi rend="ital">hirtum.</hi> Thefirst obtained its name from its being covered with skins, to protect itsdelicate fleece. The colonic is so called, from "colonus," a "husbandman," this kind being so common as to be found in any village; whereasthe tect¾ were rare.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We have some account of the Arabian sheep in ®lian, Anim.
