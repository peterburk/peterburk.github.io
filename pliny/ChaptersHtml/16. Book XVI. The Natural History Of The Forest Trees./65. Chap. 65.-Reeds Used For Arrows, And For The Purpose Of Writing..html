<div2 type="chapter" n="65" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 65.ÑREEDS USED FOR ARROWS, AND FOR THE PURPOSEOF WRITING.</head><p>It is by the aid of the reed<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> that the nations of the Eastdecide their wars; fixing in it a barbed point, they inflict awound from which the arrow cannot be withdrawn. By theaddition of feathers they accelerate the flight of this instrument of death, and the weapon, if it breaks in the wound,furnishes the combatants with a weapon afresh. With thesemissiles the warriors darken the very rays of the sun.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> It isfor this reason more particularly that they desire a clear andserene sky, and hold in abhorrence all windy and rainy weather,which has the effect of compelling them, in spite of themselves, to be at peace with one another.</p><p>If a person were carefully to enumerate the peoples of®thiopia, Egypt, Arabia, India, Scythia, Bactria, and Sarmatia,together with all the numerous peoples of the East, and thevast realms of the Parthians, he would find that fully one-halfof mankind throughout the whole world live under a dominionimposed by the agency of the arrow. It was their surpassingexcellence in this arm that so ennobled the warriors of Crete,though in this respect, as well as in all others, Italy hasgained the mastery; there being no reed in existence betteradapted for making arrows than that found in the Rhenus, ariver of the territory of Bononia: filled with a greater quantity of pith than any of the others, it is light, and easilycleaves the air, while at the same time it has sufficient weightto resist the action of the wind; an advantage that is notpossessed in an equal degree by those employed among theBelg¾. These advantages, however, are possessed by themost approved kinds that are found in Crete, although those<pb n="3405" />of India are preferred; in the opinion of some persons, however, these last are of a totally different nature, for by adding apoint to them, the natives are able to use them as lances even.Indeed, we find that in India the reed grows to the thicknessof a tree, a fact which is proved by the specimens which areeverywhere to be seen in our temples. The Indians assureus that in this plant, too, there is the distinction of male andfemale; the body of the male being more compact, and thatof the female of a larger size. In addition to this, if we cancredit the fact, a single compartment between the joints issufficiently large to answer the purposes of a boat.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> Thesereeds are found more particularly on the banks of the riverAcesines.</p><p>In every variety of the reed a single root gives birth tonumerous stems, and if cut down, they will shoot again withincreased fecundity. The root, which is naturally tenaciousof life, is also jointed as well as the stem. The reeds of Indiaare the only ones in which the leaves are short; but in all thevarieties these leaves take their rise at the joints, and surroundthe stem with a fine tissue about half way upwards to thenext joint, and then leave the stem and droop downwards.The reed, as well as the calamus, although rounded, has twosides, which throw out leaves alternately from above the joints,in such a way that when one springs from the right side, thenext issues from the joint above it on the left, and so inturns. Branches, too, shoot occasionally from the stem, beingthemselves reeds of diminutive growth.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Claus." The so-called reed of the East, used for making darts andarrows, does not belong to the genus Arundo, but to those of the Bambosand Nastus.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Few readers of history will fail to recollect the report made to KingHenry V. by Davy Gam, before the battle of Agincourt:Ñ" The enemyare so numerous," said the messenger, "that their arrows will darken thesun." "We must e'en be content to fight in the dark then," was thewarrior's reply.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. vii. c. 2. This is probably an exaggeration. He alludes tothe Bambos arundinacea of Lamarck, the Arundo arbor of C. Bauhin.</p></body>
