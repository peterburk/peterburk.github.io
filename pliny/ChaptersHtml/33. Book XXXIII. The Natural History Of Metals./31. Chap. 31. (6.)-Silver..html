(6.)—SILVER.</head><p>After stating these facts, we come to speak of silver ore,the next<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> folly of mankind. Silver is never found but inshafts sunk deep in the ground, there being no indications toraise hopes of its existence, no shining sparkles, as in the caseof gold. The earth in which it is found is sometimes red, sometimesof an ashy hue. It is impossible, too, to melt<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> it, except<pb n="6112" />in combination with lead<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> or with galena,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> this last being thename given to the vein of lead that is mostly found runningnear the veins of the silver ore. When submitted, too, to theaction of fire, part of the ore precipitates itself in the form oflead,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> while the silver is left floating on the surface,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> like oilon water.</p><p>Silver is found in nearly all our provinces, but the finest ofall is that of Spain; where it is found, like gold, in uncultivatedsoils, and in the mountains even. Wherever, too, onevein of silver has been met with, another is sure to be foundnot far off: a thing that has been remarked, in fact, in the caseof nearly all the metals, which would appear from this circumstanceto have derived their Greek name of "metalla."<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> Itis a remarkable fact, that the shafts opened by Hannibal<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> inthe Spanish provinces are still worked, their names being derivedfrom the persons who were the first to discover them.One of these mines, which at the present day is still called Bæbelo,furnished Hannibal with three hundred pounds' weight of silverper day. The mountain is already excavated for a distance offifteen hundred<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> paces; and throughout the whole of thisdistance there are water-bearers<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> standing night and day,baling out the water in turns, regulated by the light of torches,and so forming quite a river.</p><p>The vein of silver that is found nearest the surface is known<pb n="6113" />by the name of "crudaria."<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> In ancient times, the excavationsused to be abandoned the moment alum<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> was met with, and nofurther<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> search was made. Of late, however, the discovery ofa vein of copper beneath alum, has withdrawn any such limitsto man's hopes. The exhalations from silver-mines are dangerousto all animals, but to dogs more particularly. Thesofter they are, the more beautiful gold and silver are considered.It is a matter of surprise with most persons, that linestraced<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> with silver should be black.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In due succession to gold.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxxiv. cc. 17, 53.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Plumbum nigrum"—"Black lead," literally: so called by the ancients,in contradistinction to "plumbum album," white lead," our "tin,"probably.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Lead ore; identified with "molybdæna" in B. xxxiv. c. 53.
