It is not clearlyknown what animal he alludes to under this name. Snails, Cuvier says, arehermaphrodites, and so is the helix, but still they require sexual connectionfor the purposes of reproduction. The greater part of the marine univalves, on the other hand, are of separate sexes; but the organ of the malebeing proportionally of great length, and coiled in part beneath its mantle,this fact may very possibly have given rise to the notion here mentionedby our author, that the animal impregnates itself.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This can only be understood, Cuvier says, as applying to those animalsthe young of which are still enveloped in the membranes of the egg: forin general, the young of fish, from the moment of their birth, have eyesof great beauty, and are remarkable for the quickness of their sight.</p></body>
