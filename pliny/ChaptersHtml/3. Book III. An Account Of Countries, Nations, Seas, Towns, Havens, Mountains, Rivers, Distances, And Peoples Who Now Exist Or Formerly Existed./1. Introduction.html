<div2 type="chapter" n="0" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>INTRODUCTION.</head><p>Thus far have I treated of the position and the wonders ofthe earth, of the waters, the stars, and the proportion ofthe universe and its dimensions. I shall now proceed todescribe its individual parts; although indeed we may withreason look upon the task as of an infinite nature, and onenot to be rashly commenced upon without incurring censure.And yet, on the other hand, there is nothing which ought lessto require an apology, if it is only considered how far fromsurprising it is that a mere mortal cannot be acquaintedwith everything. I shall therefore not follow any singleauthor, but shall employ, in relation to each subject, suchwriters as I shall look upon as most worthy of credit. For,indeed, it is the characteristic of nearly all of them, thatthey display the greatest care and accuracy in the description of the countries in which they respectively flourished;so that by doing this, I shall neither have to blame nor contradict any one.</p><p>The names of the different places will here be simplygiven, and as briefly as possible; the account of their celebrity, and the events which have given rise thereto, beingdeferred to a more appropriate occasion; for it must beremembered that I am here speaking of the earth as a whole,and I wish to be understood as using the names without anyreference whatever to their celebrity, and as though theplaces themselves were in their infancy, and had not as yetacquired any fame through great events. The name is men-tioned, it is true, but only as forming a part of the worldand the system of the universe.</p><p>The whole globe is divided into three parts, Europe, Asia,and Africa. Our description commences where the sun setsand at the Straits of Gades<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>, where the Atlantic ocean, bursting<pb n="1152" />in, is poured forth into the inland seas. As it makes itsentrance from that side, Africa is on the right hand andEurope on the left; Asia lies between them<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>; the boundariesbeing the rivers Tanais<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and Nile. The Straits of the ocean,of which I have just spoken, extend fifteen miles in length andfive<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> in breadth, measured from the village of Mellaria<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> inSpain to the Album Promontorium<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> or White Promontory inAfrica, as we learn from Turranius Gracilis, who was born inthat vicinity. Titus Livius and Cornelius Nepos howeverhave stated the breadth, where it is least, to be seven miles,and where greatest, ten; from so small a mouth as this doesso immense an expanse of water open upon us! Nor is ourastonishment diminished by the fact of its being of greatdepth; for, instead of that, there are numerous breakers andshoals, white with foam, to strike the mariner with alarm.From this circumstance it is, that many have called this spotthe threshold of The Inland Sea.</p><p>At the narrowest part of the Straits, there are mountainsplaced to form barriers to the entrance on either side,Abyla<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> in Africa, and Calpe<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> in Europe, the boundariesformerly of the labours of Hercules<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>. Hence it is that theinhabitants have called them the Columns of that god; they<pb n="1153" />also believe that they were dug through by him; upon whichthe sea, which was before excluded, gained admission, andso changed the face of nature.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now the Straits of Gibraltar.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is said more especially in reference to the western parts of Asia,the only portion which was perfectly known to the ancients. His meaning is, that Asia as a portion of the globe does not lie so far north asEurope, nor so far south as Africa.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now the Don. It was usually looked upon as the boundary betweenEurope and Asia. Pliny's meaning seems to be, that the Tanais dividesAsia from Europe, and the Nile, Asia from Africa, the more especiallyas the part to the west of the Nile was sometimes considered as belongingto Asia. It has been however suggested that he intends to assign theserivers as the extreme eastern boundaries of the internal or Mediterraneansea.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">At no spot are the Straits less than ten miles in width; althoughD'Anville makes the width to be little less than five miles. This passageof our author is probably in a corrupt state.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This probably stood near the site of the town of Tarifa of the present day.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably the point called 'Punta del Sainar' at the present day.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called Ximiera, Jebel-el-Mina, or Monte del Hacho.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Rock of Gibraltar.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The fable was that they originally formed one mountain, which wastorn asunder by Hercules, or as Pliny says, "dug through."</p></body>
