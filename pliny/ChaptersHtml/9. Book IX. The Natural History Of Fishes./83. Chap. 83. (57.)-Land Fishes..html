<div2 type="chapter" n="83" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 83. (57.)ÑLAND FISHES.</head><p>Besides these, there are still some wonderful kinds of fishes<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>which we find mentioned by Theophrastus: he says, that whenthe waters subside, which have been admitted for the purposesof irrigation in the vicinity of Babylon, there are certain fishwhich remain in such holes as may contain water; from thesethey come forth for the purpose of feeding, moving along withtheir fins by the aid of a rapid movement of the tail. If pursued, he says, they retreat to their holes, and, when they havereached them, will turn round and make a stand. The headis like that of the sea-frog, while the other parts are similarto those of the gobio,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and they have gills like other fish.He says also, that in the vicinity of Heraclea and Cromna,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and about the river Lycus, as well as in many partsof the Euxine, there is one kind of fish<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> which frequents thewaters near the banks of the rivers, and makes holes foritself, in which it lives, even when the water retires and thebed of the river is dry; for which reason these fishes have tobe dug out of the ground, and only show by the movementof the body that they are still alive. He says also, that in thevicinity of the same Heraclea, when the river Lycus ebbs, theeggs are left in the mud, and that the fish, on being producedfrom these, go forth to seek their food by means of a sort offluttering motion,Ñtheir gills being but very small, in consequence of which they are not in need of water; for this<pb n="2472" />reason it is that eels also can live so long out of water;<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> andthat their eggs come to maturity on dry land, like those of thesea-tortoise<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>. In the same regions also of the Euxine, hesays, various kinds of fishes are overtaken by the ice, the gobiomore particularly, and they only betray signs of life, bymoving when they have warmth applied by the saucepan.All these things, however, though very remarkable, still admitof some explanation. He tells us also, that in Paphlagonia,land fishes are dug up that are most excellent eating; these, hesays, are found in deep holes or spots where there is no standingwater whatever, and he expresses his surprise at their beingthus produced without any contact with moisture, stating it ashis opinion, that there is some innate virtue in these holes,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>similar to that of wells; as if, indeed, fishes really were to befound in wells.<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> However this may be, these facts, at allevents, render the life of the mole under ground less a matterfor surprise; unless, perhaps, these fishes mentioned by Theophrastus are similar in nature to the earth-worm.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier remarks, that nothing is known of the fish of the Euphrateshere mentioned by Pliny from Theophrastus; as, indeed, all particulars relative to the fresh-water fish of foreign countries are the portion of Ichthyology with which we are the least acquainted. Judging, however, fromwhat is stated as to their habits and appearance, they may be various species of the genus Gobius of Linn¾us, and more especially the one calledperiophthalmus by Bloch. These species are in the habit of crawlingalong the grass on the banks of rivers.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Generally considered the same as our gudgeon. It is called "cobio"(from the Greek <foreign lang="greek">kwbio\s</foreign>), by Pliny, in B. xxxii. c. 53. It was a worthlessfish, "Vilis piscis," as Juvenal says.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">What Heraclea, if that is the correct reading, is meant here, it isimpossible to say. Cromna is mentioned in B. vi. c. 2.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier thinks, that Pliny here alludes to a species of loche, theCobitis fossilis of Linn¾us, which keeps itself concealed in the mud, andcan survive a long time in it, after the water above it is absorbed. Henceit is often found alive in the mud of drained marshes, or in the dried-upbeds of rivers.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier remarks, that many fish, the orifice of the gills of which, likethose of the eel, is small, or which have in the interior of those partsorgans proper for the preservation there of water, are able, like the eel, tolive for some time on dry land; such, for instance, as the periophthalmipreviously mentioned, the chironectes, the ophicephali, the anabas, andothers; but it is difficult to say, he observes, of what species were those ofthe Lycus, which are here mentioned.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or turtle. See c. 12 of the present Book.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is most probable that Sillig is right in his supposition, that"quam" should be read "¾quam;" otherwise it does not appear that anysense can be made of the passage. Schneider, in his commentaries uponTheophrastus, Sillig says, quite despaired of either amending or explainingthis passage; which, however, with Sillig's emendation is very easily to beunderstood.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In accordance with the opinion of Vossius and Sillig, we read here"in illis," instead of the common, and most probably incorrect, reading,in nullis."</p></body>
