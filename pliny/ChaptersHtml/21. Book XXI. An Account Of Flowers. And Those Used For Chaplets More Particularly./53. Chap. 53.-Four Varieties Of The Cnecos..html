The principal varieties are thewild and the cultivated kinds; of the wild variety, again, theare two sorts, one of which is less prickly<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> than the other, butwith a similar stem, only more upright: hence it is that informer times females used it for distaffs, from which circumstance it has received the name of "atractylis"<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> from some;the seed of it is white, large, and bitter. The other variety<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>is more prickly, and has a more sinewy stem, which may besaid almost to creep upon the ground; the seed is small. Thecnecos belongs to the thorny plants: indeed, it will be as wellto make some classification of them.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Carthamus tinctorius of Linnæus, or bastard saffron.
