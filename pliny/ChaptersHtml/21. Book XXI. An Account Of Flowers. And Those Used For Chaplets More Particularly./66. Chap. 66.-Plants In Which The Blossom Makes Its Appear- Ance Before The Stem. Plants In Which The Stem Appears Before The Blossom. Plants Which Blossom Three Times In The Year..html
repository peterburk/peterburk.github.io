PLANTS WHICH BLOSSOM THREE TIMESIN THE YEAR.</head><p>The peculiarities also of the squill and saffron deserve remark; for while all other plants put forth their leaves first,and then a round stem, these show the stem before the leafmakes its appearance: in the saffron, however, the blossom isprotruded by the stem, but in the squill it is the stem thatfirst makes its appearance, and then the flower emerges fromit. This plant blossoms three times in the year, indicatingthereby, as previously stated,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> the three seasons for ploughing.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. xviii. c. 65.</p></body>
