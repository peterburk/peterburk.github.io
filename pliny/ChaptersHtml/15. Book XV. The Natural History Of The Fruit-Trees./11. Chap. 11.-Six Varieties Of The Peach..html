<div2 type="chapter" n="11" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 11.ÑSIX VARIETIES OF THE PEACH.</head><p>Under the head of apples,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> we include a variety of fruits,although of an entirely different nature, such as the Persian<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>apple, for instance, and the pomegranate, of which, whenspeaking of the tree, we have already enumerated<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> nine varieties. The pomegranate has a seed within, enclosed in a<pb n="3294" />skin; the peach has a stone inside. Some among the pears,also, known as "libralia,"<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> show, by their name, what aremarkable weight they attain.</p><p>(12.) Among the peaches the palm must be awarded to theduracinus:<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> the Gallic and the Asiatic peach are distinguishedrespectively by the names of the countries of their origin.They ripen at the end of autumn, though some of the early.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>kinds are ripe in the summer. It is only within the last thirtyyears that these last have been introduced; originally theywere sold at the price of a denarius a piece. Those known asthe "supernatia"<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> come from the country of the Sabines, butthe "popularia" grow everywhere. This is a very harmlessfruit, and a particular favourite with invalids: some, in fact,have sold before this as high as thirty sesterces apiece, a pricethat has never been exceeded by any other fruit. This, too, isthe more to be wondered at, as there is none that is a worsekeeper: for, when it is once plucked, the longest time that itwill keep is a couple of days; and so sold it must be, fetchwhat it may.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Mala." The term "malum," somewhat similar to "pome" withus, was applied to a number of different fruits: the orange, the citron,the pomegranate, the apricot, and others.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or peach.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xiii. c. 34.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "pound-weight" pears: the Pirus volema of Linn¾us.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "hard-berry"Ñprobably in reference to the firmness of the flesh.It is generally thought to be the nectarine.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Pr¾cocia." It is generally thought that in this name originatesthe word "apricot," the Prunus Armeniaca of Linn¾us. There is, however, an early peach that ripens by the middle of July, though it is verydoubtful if it was known to Pliny.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"From above."</p></body>
