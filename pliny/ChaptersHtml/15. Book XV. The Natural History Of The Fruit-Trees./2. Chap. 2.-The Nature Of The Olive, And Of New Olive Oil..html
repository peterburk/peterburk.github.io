<div2 type="chapter" n="2" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 2.—THE NATURE OF THE OLIVE, AND OF NEW OLIVE OIL.</head><p>Fabianus maintains that the olive will grow<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> neither invery cold climates, nor yet in very hot ones. Virgil<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> hasmentioned three varieties of the olive, the orchites,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> theradius,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and the posia;<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> and says that they require no rakingor pruning, nor, in fact, any attention whatever. There is nodoubt that in the case of these plants, soil and climate are thethings of primary importance; but still, it is usual to prunethem at the same time as the vine, and they are improved bylopping between them every here and there. The gathering ofthe olive follows that of the grape, and there is even a greaterdegree of skill required in preparing<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> oil than in makingwine; for the very same olives will frequently give quitedifferent results. The first oil of all, produced from the raw<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>olive before it has begun to ripen, is considered preferableto all the others in flavour; in this kind, too, the first<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> droppings of the press are the most esteemed, diminishing graduallyin goodness and value; and this, whether the wicker-work<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>basket is used in making it, or whether, following the more<pb n="3279" />recent plan, the pulp is put in a stick strainer, with narrowspikes and interstices.<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> The riper the berry, the more unctuous the juice, and the less agreeable the taste.<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> To obtain aresult both abundant and of excellent flavour, the best time togather it is when the berry is just on the point of turningblack. In this state it is called "druppa" by us, by theGreeks, "drypetis."</p><p>In addition to these distinctions, it is of importance toobserve whether the berry ripens in the press or while on thebranch; whether the tree has been watered, or whether thefruit has been nurtured solely by its own juices, and hasimbibed nothing else but the dews of heaven.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is the case. We may remark that the tree will grow in thiscountry, but the fruit never comes to maturity.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Georg. ii. 85, also ii. 420.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably the Olea maximo fructu of Tournefort.
