<div2 type="chapter" n="8" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 8.—PARTICULARS CONNECTED WITH THE EQUESTRIAN ORDER.</head><p>At length, however, in the ninth<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> year of the reign of theEmperor Tiberius, the equestrian order was united in a singlebody; and a decree was passed, establishing to whom belongedthe right of wearing the ring, in the consulship of C. AsiniusPollio and C. Antistius Vetus, the year from the foundation of theCity, 775. It is a matter for surprise, how almost futile, wemay say, was the cause which led to this change. C. SulpiciusGalba,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> desirous in his youth to establish his credit with theEmperor by hunting<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> out grounds for prosecuting<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> the keepers<pb n="6084" />of victualling-houses, made complaint in the senate that theproprietors of those places were in the habit of protectingthemselves from the consequences of their guilt by their pleaof wearing the golden ring.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> For this reason, an ordinancewas made that no person whatsoever should have this right ofwearing the ring, unless, freeborn himself as regarded hisfather and paternal grandfather, he should be assessed by thecensors at four hundred thousand sesterces, and entitled, underthe Julian Law,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> to sit in the fourteen tiers of seats at thetheatre. In later times, however, people began to apply inwhole crowds for this mark of rank; and in consequence ofthe diversities of opinion which were occasioned thereby, theEmperor Caius<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> added a fifth decury to the number. Indeedto such a pitch has conceit now arisen, that whereas, under thelate Emperor Augustus, the decuries could not be completed,at the present day they will not suffice to receive all the membersof the equestrian order, and we see in every quarter personseven who have been but just liberated from slavery, makinga leap all at once to the distinction of the golden ring: a thingthat never used to happen in former days, as it was by thering of iron that the equites and the judices were then to berecognized.</p><p>Indeed, so promiscuously was this privilege at last conferred,that Flavius Proculus, one of the equites, informed againstfour hundred persons on this ground, before the Emperor Claudius,who was then censor:<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> and thus we see, an order, whichwas established as a mark of distinction from other private individualsof free birth, has been shared in common with slaves !</p><p>The Gracchi were the first to attach to this order the separateappellation of "judices," their object being at the same momenta seditious popularity and the humiliation of the senate. Afterthe fall of these men, in consequence of the varying results ofseditious movements, the name and influence of the equestrianorder were lost, and became merged in those of the publicani,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span><pb n="6085" />who, for some time, were the men that constituted the thirdclass in the state. At last, however, Marcus Cicero, duringhis consulship, and at the period of the Catilinarian troubles,re-established the equestrian name, it being his vaunt that hehimself had sprung from that order, and he, by certain acts ofpopularity peculiar to himself, having conciliated its support.Since that period, it is very clear that the equites have formedthe third body in the state, and the name of the equestrian orderhas been added to the formula—"The Senate and People ofRome." Hence<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> it is, too, that at the present day even, thename of this order is written after that of the people, it beingthe one that was the last instituted.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Tacitus says that this took place the year before, in the consulship ofC.
