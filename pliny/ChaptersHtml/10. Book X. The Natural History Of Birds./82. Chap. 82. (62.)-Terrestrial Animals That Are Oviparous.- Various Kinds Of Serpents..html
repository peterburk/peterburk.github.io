This, too, is the only one among the terrestrialanimals that lays eggs within its body—of one colour, and soft,like those of fishes. On the third day it hatches its young inthe uterus, and then excludes them, one every day, and generally twenty in number; the last ones become so impatientof their confinement, that they force a passage through thesides of their parent, and so kill her. Other serpents, again,lay eggs attached to one another, and then bury them in theearth; the young being hatched in the following year. Crocodiles sit on their eggs in turns, first the male, and then thefemale. But let us now turn to the generation of the rest ofthe terrestrial animals.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is probably fabulous.</p></body>
