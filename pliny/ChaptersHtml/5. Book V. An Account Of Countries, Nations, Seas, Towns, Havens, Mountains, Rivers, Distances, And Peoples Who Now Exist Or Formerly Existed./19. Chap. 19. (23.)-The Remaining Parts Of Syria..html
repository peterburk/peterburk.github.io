<div2 type="chapter" n="19" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 19. (23.)—THE REMAINING PARTS OF SYRIA.</head><p>We must now speak of the interior of Syria. Cœle Syria<pb n="1439" />has the town of Apamea<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>, divided by the river Marsyas fromthe Tetrarchy of the Nazerini<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>; Bambyx, the other name ofwhich is Hierapolis<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>, but by the Syrians called Mabog<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>,(here the monster Atargatis<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>, called Derceto by the Greeks,is worshipped); and the place called Chalcis<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> on the Belus<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>,from which the region of Chalcidene, the most fertile part ofSyria, takes its name. We here find also Cyrrhestice, withCyrrhum<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>, the Gazatæ, the Gindareni, the Gabeni, the twoTetrarchies called Granucomatæ<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>, the Emeseni<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>, the Hyla-<pb n="1440" />tæ<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>, the nation of the Ituræi, and a branch of them, thepeople called the Bætarreni; the Mariamitani<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>, the Tetrarchyknown as Marnmisea, Paradisus<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>, Pagræ<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>, thePinaritæ<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>, two cities called Seleucia, besides the one alreadymentioned, the one Seleucia on the Euphrates<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span>, andthe other Seleucia<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> on the Belus, and the Cardytenses.The remaining part of Syria (except those parts which willbe spoken of in conjunction with the Euphrates) containsthe Arethusii<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span>, the Berœenses<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span>, and the Epiphanæenses<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span>;<pb n="1441" />and on the east, the Laodiceni<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span>, who are called the Laodicenion the Libanus, the Leucadii<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span>, and the Larissæi, besidesseventeen other Tetrarchies, divided into kingdoms andbearing barbarous names.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Kulat-el-Mudik, situate in the valley of the Orontes, and capital of the province of Apamene. It was fortified and enlarged by Seleucus Nicator, who gave it its name, after his wife Apama. It also bore the Macedonian name of Pella. It was situate on a hill, and was so far surrounded by the windings of the Orontes, as to become a peninsula, whence its name of Chersonesus. Very extensive ruins of this place still exist.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is suggested, that these are the Phylarchi Arabes of Strabo, now called the Nosairis, who were situate to the east of Apamea. The river Marsyas here mentioned was a small tributary of the Orontes, into which it falls on the east side, near Apamea.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This was situate in Cyrrhestica, in Syria, on the high road from Antioch to Mesopotamia, twenty-four miles to the west of the Euphrates, and thirty-six to the south-west of Zeugma; two and a half days' journey from Berœa, and five from Antioch. It obtained its Greek name of the "Sacred City" from Seleucus Nicator, owing to its being the chief seat of the worship of the Syrian goddess Astarte. Its ruins were first discovered by Maundrell.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In the former editions it is "Magog;" but Sillig's reading of "Mabog" is correct, and corresponds with the Oriental forms of Munbedj, Manbesja, Manbesjun, Menba, Manba, Manbegj, and the modern name, Kara Bambuche, or Buguk Munbedj.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Astarte, the semi-fish goddess.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This Chalcis is supposed to have been situate somewhere in the district of the Buckaa, probably south of Heliopolis, or Baalbec. It has been suggested, that its site may have been at, or near Zahle; in the vicinity of which, at the village of Heusn Nieba, are to be seen some remarkable remains. Or else, possibly, at Majdel Anjar, where Abulfeda speaks of great ruins of hewn stone.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ansart suggests, that Belus is here the name of a mountain, and that it may be the same that is now called Djebel-il-Semmaq.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">To the north of Chalcidene, a town of Syria, on the slopes of the Taurus, eighty miles to the north-east of Antioch. In the Roman times, it was the head-quarters of the Tenth Legion. The ruins near the modern village of Corus represent the ancient Cyrrhus. Of the Gazatæ and Gindareni, nothing is known.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Possibly meaning the "Burghers of Granum." Nothing is known of these people.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The people of Emesa, a city in the district of Apamene, on the right, or eastern bank of the Orontes, to which, in C. 26 of the present Book, Pliny assigns a desert district beyond Palmyra. It was celebrated in ancient times for its magnificent temple of the sun, and the appointment of its priest, Bassianus, or Heliogabalus, to the imperial dignity, in his fourteenth year. It was made a colony, with the <hi rend="ital">jus Italicum,</hi> by Caracalla, and afterwards became the capital of Phœnicia Libanesia. The present name of its site is Hems.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Hylatæ are totally unknown. Ituræa was situate in the north-east of Palestine, and, with Trachonitis, belonged to the tetrarchy of Philip. Its boundaries cannot be precisely determined; but it may probably be traversed by a line drawn from the Lake of Tiberias to Damascus.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">According to Ptolemy, the people of Mariama, some miles to the west of Emesa.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In the district of Laodicea, according to Ptolemy.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Near the Portæ Amani, or "Passes of Amanus."</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pinara was near Pagræ, in Pieria, last mentioned.</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably Seleucia, in Mesopotamia, now called Bir, on the left bank of the Euphrates, opposite to the ford of Zeugma, a fortress of considerable importance.</p><p><span id="note_17"><a href="#ref_17">17. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Its site is doubtful. Sebj d'Aboulgazi has been suggested.</p><p><span id="note_18"><a href="#ref_18">18. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The people of Arethusa, a city of Syria, not far from Apamea, situate between Epiphania and Emesa. In later times, it took the name of Restan.</p><p><span id="note_19"><a href="#ref_19">19. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The people of Berœa, a town of Syria, midway between Antioch and Hierapolis. Seleucus Nicator gave to it the Macedonian name of Berœa; but, in A.D. <date value="638" authname="638">638</date>, it resumed its ancient name of Chaleb, or Chalybon. The modern Haleb, or Aleppo, occupies its site. Some excavations, on the eastern side of it, are the only vestiges of ancient remains in the neighbourhood.</p><p><span id="note_20"><a href="#ref_20">20. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The people of Epiphanæa, placed by Ptolemy in the district of Cassiotis, in which also Antioch and Larissa were situate. The Itinerary of Antoninus places it sixteen miles from Larissa, thirty-two from Emesa, and 101 from Antioch of Syria. It is supposed to have been identical with the ancient Hamath, mentioned in 2 Sam. viii. 9; 1 Kings viii. 65; Isaiah x. 9, and called "Hamath the great" in Amos vi. 2, which name it also retained in the time of St. Jerome.</p><p><span id="note_21"><a href="#ref_21">21. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The people of Laodicea ad Libanum, a city of Cœle-Syria, at thenorthern entrance to the narrow valley, between Libanus and Anti-Libanus. During the possession of Cœle-Syria by the Greek kings ofEgypt, it was the south west border fortress of Syria. It was the chiefcity of a district called Laodicene.</p><p><span id="note_22"><a href="#ref_22">22. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Of Leucas, or Leucadia, nothing is known. Larissa, in Syria, wasa city in the district of Apamene, on the western bank of the Orontes,about half-way between Apamea and Epiphania. The site is now calledKulat-Seijar.</p></body>
