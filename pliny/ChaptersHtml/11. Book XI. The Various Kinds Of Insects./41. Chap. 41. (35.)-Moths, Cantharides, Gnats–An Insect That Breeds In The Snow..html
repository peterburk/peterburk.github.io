<div2 type="chapter" n="41" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 41. (35.)—MOTHS, CANTHARIDES, GNATS–AN INSECTTHAT BREEDS IN THE SNOW.</head><p>Dust, too, is productive of worms<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> in wools and cloths, andthis more especially if a spider should happen to be enclosedin them: for, being sensible of thirst, it sucks up all the mois-ture, and thereby increases the dryness of the material. Thesewill breed in paper also. There is one kind which carrieswith it its husk, in the same manner as the snail, only thatthe feet are to be seen. If deprived of it, it does not survive;and when it is fully developed, the insect becomes a chrysalis.The wild fig-tree produces gnats,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> known as "ficarii;" andthe little grubs of the fig-tree, the pear-tree, the pine, thewild rose, and the common rose produce cantharides,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> whenfully developed. These insects, which are venomous, carrywith them their antidote; for their wings are useful in<pb n="3042" />medicine,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> while the rest of the body is deadly. Again,liquids turned sour will produce other kinds of gnats, andwhite grubs are to be found in snow that has lain long on theground, while those that lie above are of a reddish<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> colour—indeed, the snow itself becomes red after it has lain sometime on the ground. These grubs are covered with a sort ofhair, are of a rather large size, and in a state of torpor.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">These are really the larvæ of night-moths. His account here ispurely imaginary.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He speaks of the Cynips psenes of Linnæus, which breeds on theblossom of the fig-tree, and aids in its fecundation.

They are first an egg,then a larva, then a nympha, and then the insect fully developed.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxix. c. 30.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The redness sometimes observed on the snow of the Alps and thePyrenees, is supposed by De Lamarck to be produced by animalculæ:other naturalists, however, suppose it to arise from vegetable or mineralcauses.</p></body>
