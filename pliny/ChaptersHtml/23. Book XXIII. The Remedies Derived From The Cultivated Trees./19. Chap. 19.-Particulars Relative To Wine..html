<div2 type="chapter" n="19" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 19.â€”PARTICULARS RELATIVE TO WINE.</head><p>We have already<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> described the various kinds of wine, thenumerous differences which exist between them, and most ofthe properties which each kind possesses. There is no subjectthat presents greater difficulties than this, or, indeed, a morevaried field for discussion, it being extremely difficult to pronounce whether wine is more generally injurious in its effects,or beneficial. And then, in addition to this, how very uncertain is it, whether, the moment we have drunk it, it will beproductive of salutary results, or turn out no better than somuch poison! However, it is only with reference to its medicinal properties, that we are now about to speak of it.<pb n="4470" /></p><p>Asclepiades has composed a whole treatise (which hasthence received its name<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>) on the proper methods of administering wine; and the number of commentators who have sincewritten on this treatise, is almost innumerable. For my ownpart, with all that gravity which becomes a Roman, and onezealous for the furtherance of liberal pursuits, I shall enter into acareful examination of this subject, not, indeed, in the character of a physician, but as a careful investigator of theeffects which wine is likely to produce upon the health of man-kind. To treat, however, of the medicinal properties of eachindividual kind, would be a labour without end, and quite inexhaustible; the more so, as the opinions of medical men areso entirely at variance upon the subject.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. xiv. cc. 8, 9, 10.
