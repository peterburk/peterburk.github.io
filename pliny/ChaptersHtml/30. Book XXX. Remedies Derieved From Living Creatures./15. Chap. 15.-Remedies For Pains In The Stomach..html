<div2 type="chapter" n="15" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 15.—REMEDIES FOR PAINS IN THE STOMACH.</head><p>One of the very best remedies for affections of the stomach,is to use a snail diet.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> They must first be left to simmer inwater for some time, without touching the contents of theshell, after which, without any other addition, they must begrilled upon hot coals, and eaten with wine and garum;<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> thesnails of Africa being the best of all for the purpose. Theefficacy of this remedy has been proved in numerous instancesof late. Another point, too, to be observed, is to take an uneven number of them. Snails, however, have a juice, it shouldbe remembered, which imparts to the breath an offensive smell.<pb n="5438" />For patients troubled with spitting of blood, they are remarkably good, the shell being first removed, and the contentsbruised and administered in water. The most esteemed kindsof all are those of Africa—those which come from Iol,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> inparticular—of Astypalæa, and, after them, those of Ætna, inSicily, those I mean of moderate size, for the large ones arehard, and destitute of juice. The Balearic snails, called "cavaticæ," from being found in caverns, are much esteemed; andso, too, are those from the islands of Capreæ.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> Those of Greece,on the other hand, are never used for food, either old orfresh.</p><p>River snails, and those with a white shell, have a strong,rank, juice, and forest snails are by no means good for thestomach, having a laxative effect upon the bowels; the same,too, with all kinds of small snails. Sea-snails,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> on the otherhand, are more beneficial to the stomach; but it is for painsin that region that they are found the most efficacious: thebest plan, it is said, is to eat them alive, of whatever kindthey may happen to be, with vinegar. In addition to these,there are the snails called "aceratæ,"<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> with a broad shell, andfound in numerous localities: of the uses to which they areput we shall<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> speak further on the appropriate occasions. Thecraw of poultry, dried and sprinkled in the drink, or else usedfresh and grilled, has a soothing effect upon pectoral catarrhsand coughs attended with phlegm.<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> Snails, beaten up rawand taken in three cyathi of warm water, allay cough. Apiece of dog's skin, wrapped round any one of the fingers, affords relief to patients suffering from catarrh. A broth madeof boiled partridges is strengthening for the stomach.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In France and Italy, snails are considered a delicacy by some.
