(28.)—PROGNOSTICS OF DANGER DERIVED FROM ANIMALS.</head><p>There are a thousand other facts of this kind: and thesame Nature has also bestowed upon many animals as well,the faculty of observing the heavens, and of presaging thewinds, rains, and tempests, each in its own peculiar way. Itwould be an endless labour to enumerate them all; just asmuch as it would be to point out the relation of each to man.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>For, in fact, they warn us of danger, not only by their fibresand their entrails, to which a large portion of mankind attachthe greatest faith, but by other kinds of warnings as well.When a building is about to fall down, all the mice desert it<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>before-hand, and the spiders with their webs are the first todrop. Divination from birds has been made a science amongthe Romans, and the college of its priests is looked upon aspeculiarly sacred.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> In Thrace, when all parts are covered<pb n="2295" />with ice, the foxes are consulted, an animal which, in otherrespects, is baneful from its craftiness. It has been observed,that this animal applies its ear to the ice, for the purpose oftesting its thickness; hence it is, that the inhabitants willnever cross frozen rivers and lakes until the foxes have passedover them and returned.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Quod persequi immensum est æque scilicet quam reliquam cumsingulis homiaum societatem." The meaning of this passage is obscure,and extremely doubtful.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is alluded to by Cicero in his letters to Atticus, and is mentionedby Ælian, Anim. Nat. B. vi. c. 41; B. xi. c. 19; and Var. Hist. B. i.c. 11.—B. The same is still said of rats, whence our expression "to rat,"<hi rend="ital">i. e.</hi> to desert a falling cause.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The priests of this college, or augurs, were among the most importantpublic functionaries in the Roman state, both from the rank of the indivi-duals and the political power which they derived from their office.—B. Theaugurs, or diviners by birds, held the highest rank in the state; but thepower of their college greatly declined in the later period of the Romanhistory. It was finally abolished by the Emperor Theodosius.</p></body>
