The highest place, however, in public estimation, washeld by the plaited chaplet; such as we find used<pb n="4309" />by the Salii in their sacred rites, and at the solemnization oftheir yearly<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> banquets. In later times, the rose chaplet hasbeen adopted, and luxury arose at last to such a pitch that achaplet was held in no esteem at all if it did not consist entirely of leaves sown together with the needle. More recently,again, they have been imported from India, or from nationsbeyond the countries of India.</p><p>But it is looked upon as the most refined of all, to presentchaplets made of nard leaves, or else of silk of many colourssteeped in unguents. Such is the pitch to which the luxuriousness of our women has at last arrived!</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This usage is still observed in the <hi rend="ital">immortelles,</hi> laid onthe tombs ofdeparted friends, in Catholic countries on the continent.
