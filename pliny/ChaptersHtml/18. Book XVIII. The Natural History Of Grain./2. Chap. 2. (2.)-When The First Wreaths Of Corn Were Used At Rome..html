<div2 type="chapter" n="2" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 2. (2.)ÑWHEN THE FIRST WREATHS OF CORN WERE USED AT ROME.</head><p>Romulus was the first who established the Arval<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> priesthoodat Rome. This order consisted of the eleven sons of AccraPlacentia, his nurse,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> together with Romulus himself, who assumed the appellation of the twelfth of the brotherhood. Uponthis priesthood he bestowed, as being the most august dis-tinction that he could confer upon it, a wreath of years of corn,tied together with a white fillet; and this in fact, was thefirst chaplet that was ever used at Rome.This dignity is onlyended with life itself, and whether in exile or in captivity, it<pb n="4004" />always attends its owner. In those early days, two jugera ofland were considered enough for a citizen of Rome, and to nonewas a larger portion than this allotted. And yet, at the presentday, men who but lately were the slaves of the Emperor Nerohave been hardly content with pleasure-gardens that occupiedthe same space as this; while they must have fishponds, forsooth, of still greater extent, and in some instances I mightadd, perhaps, kitchens even as well.</p><p>Numa first established the custom of offering corn to thegods, and of propitiating them with the salted<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> cake; he wasthe first, too, as we learn from Hemina, to parch spelt, fromthe fact that, when in this state, it is more wholesome as analiment<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> This method, however, he could only establish oneway: by making an enactment, to the effect that spelt is notin a pure state for offering, except when parched. He it was,too, who instituted the Fornacalia,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> festivals appropriatedfor the parching of corn, and others,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> observed with equalsolemnity, for the erection and preservation of the "termini,"or boundaries of the fields: for these termini, in those days,they particularly regarded as gods; while to other divinitiesthey gave the names of Seia,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> from "sero," "to sow," and ofSegesta, from tile "segetes," or "crops of standing corn," thestatues of which goddesses we still see erected in the Circus.A third divinity it is forbidden by the rules of our religion toname even<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> beneath a roof. In former days, too, they wouldnot so much as taste the corn when newly cut, nor yet winewhen just made, before the priests had made a libation of thefirst-fruits.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Arvorum sacerdotal," the priests of the fields.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or foster-mother.
