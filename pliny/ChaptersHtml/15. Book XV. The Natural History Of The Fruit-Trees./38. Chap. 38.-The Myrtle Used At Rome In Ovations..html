<div2 type="chapter" n="38" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 38.—THE MYRTLE USED AT ROME IN OVATIONS.</head><p>The myrtle has played<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> its part, also, in the successes ofwar. Posthumius Tubertus, who gained a victory over theSabines in his consulship,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> was the first person who enteredthe City enjoying the honour of an ovation,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> for havingachieved this success with ease and without bloodshed; uponwhich occasion he made his entry crowned with the myrtle ofVenus Victrix, and thereby rendered her tree an object ofregard<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> to our enemies even. Ever since this occasion, thewreath of those who have enjoyed an ovation has been madeof myrtle, with the exception of M. Crassus,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> who, on his victory over the fugitive slaves and Spartacus, made his entrycrowned with laurels. Massurius informs us, also, that somegenerals, on the occasion of a triumph even, have worn awreath of myrtle in the triumphal car. L. Piso states that<pb n="3332" />Papirius Maso, who was the first to enjoy a triumph for avictory over the Marsi—it was on the Alban Mount<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>—wasin the habit of attending at the games of the Circus, wearinga wreath of myrtle: he was the maternal grandfather of thesecond Scipio Africanus. Marcus Valerius<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> wore two wreaths,one of laurel, the other of myrtle; it was in consequence ofa vow which he had made to that effect.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In addition to all those particulars, he might have stated that theLares, or household gods, were crowned with myrtle, and that it was notallowed to enter the Temple of Bona Dea.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A.U.C. 251.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See the Notes to c. 35 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Because the enemy would be less likely to envy us a bloodless triumph.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He disdained the more humble myrtle crown, and intrigued successfully with the Senate to allow him to wear a wreath of laurel.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Senate refused him a triumph; and he accordingly celebratedone on the Alban Mount, B.C. <date value="-231" authname="-231">231</date>. Paulus Diaconus says that hisreason for wearing a myrtle crown was his victory over the Corsicans onthe Myrtle Plains, though where they were, or what victory is alluded to,is not known.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The brother of Valerius Publicola.</p></body>
