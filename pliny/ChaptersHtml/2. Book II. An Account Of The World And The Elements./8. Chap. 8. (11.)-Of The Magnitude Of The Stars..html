<div2 type="chapter" n="8" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 8. (11.)—OF THE MAGNITUDE OF THE STARS.</head><p>This kind of reasoning carries the human mind to theheavens, and by contemplating the world as it were fromthence, it discloses to us the magnitude of the three greatestbodies in nature<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>. For the sun could not be entirely concealed from the earth, by the intervention of the moon, if theearth were greater than the moon<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>. And the vast size ofthe third body, the sun, is manifest from that of the othertwo, so that it is not necessary to scrutinize its size, by arguing from its visible appearance, or from any conjectures ofthe mind; it must be immense, because the shadows of rowsof trees, extending for any number of miles, are disposed inright lines<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>, as if the sun were in the middle of space. Also,because, at the equinox, he is vertical to all the inhabitantsof the southern districts at the same time<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>; also, becausethe shadows of all the people who live on this side of thetropic fall, at noon, towards the north, and, at sunrise, pointto the west. But this could not be the case unless the sunwere much greater than the earth; nor, unless it much exceeded Mount Ida in breadth, could he be seen when herises, passing considerably beyond it to the right and to theleft, especially, considering that it is separated by so greatan interval<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>.<pb n="1036" /></p><p>The eclipse of the moon affords an undoubted argumentof the sun's magnitude, as it also does of the small size ofthe earth<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>. For there are shadows of three figures, and it isevident, that if the body which produces the shadow be equalto the light, then it will be thrown off in the form of a pillar,and have no termination. If the body be greater than thelight, the shadow will be in the form of an inverted cone<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>,the bottom being the narrowest part, and being, at the sametime, of an infinite length. If the body be less than thelight, then we shall have the figure of a pyramid<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>, terminating in apoint. Now of this last kind is the shadow whichproduces the eclipse of the moon, and this is so manifest thatthere can be no doubt remaining, that the earth is exceededin magnitude by the sun, a circumstance which is indeed indicated by the silent declaration of nature herself. For whydoes he recede from us at the winter half of the year<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>? Thatby the darkness of the nights the earth may be refreshed,which otherwise would be burned up, as indeed it is in certain parts; so great is his size.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Marcus conceives that our author must here mean, not the actual,but the apparent size of these bodies; Ajasson, ii. 295; but I do not perceive that the text authorizes this interpretation.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">I have given the simple translation of the original as it now standsin the MSS.; whether these may have been corrupted, or the authorreasoned incorrectly, I do not venture to decide. The commentatorshave, according to their usual custom, proposed various emendations andexplanations, for which I may refer to the note of Hardouin in Lemaire,ii. 252, with the judicious remarks of Alexandre, and to those of Marcusin Ajasson, ii. 295–298, who appear to me to take a correct view of thesubject.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Alexandre remarks, "Hinc tamen potius distantia quam magnitudoSolis colligi potest." Lemaire, ii. 252. And the same remark appliesto the two next positions of our author.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Alexandre remarks on the argument of our author, perhaps a littletoo severely, "Absurde dictum; nam aliis oritur, aliis occidit, dum aliisest a vertice; quod vel pueri sentiunt." Lemaire, ii. 253. But we maysuppose, that Pliny, in this passage, only meant to say, that as the sunbecame vertical to each successive part of the equinoctial district, noshadows were formed in it.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The commentators have thought it necessary to discuss the question,whether, in this passage, Pliny refers to the Ida of Crete or of Asia Minor.But the discussion is unnecessary, as the statement of the author is equallyinapplicable to both of them. Mela appears to refer to this opinion inthe following passage, where he is describing the Ida of Asia Minor;"ipse mens...orientem solem aiter quam in aliis terris solet aspici,ostentat." lib. i. cap. 18.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Ut dictum est superiore capite, quo Plinius falso contendit Terramesse Luna minorem." Alexandre in Lemaire, ii. 253. The words of thetext, however, apply equally to the comparative size of the earth and thesun, as of the earth and the moon.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"turbo rectus;" literally an upright top.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"meta."</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This has been pointed out as one of our author's erroneous opinionson astronomy. The earth is really about 1/30 nearer the sun in our wintersthan in our summers. The greater degree of heat produced by his raysin the latter case depends upon their falling on the surface of the earthless obliquely. This is the principal cause of the different temperaturesof the equatorial and polar regions.</p></body>
