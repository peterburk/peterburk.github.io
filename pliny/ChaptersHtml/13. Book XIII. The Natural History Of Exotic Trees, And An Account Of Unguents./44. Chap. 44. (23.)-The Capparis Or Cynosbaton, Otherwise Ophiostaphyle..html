(23.)—THE CAPPARIS OR CYNOSBATON, OTHERWISEOPHIOSTAPHYLE.</head><p>In Egypt, too, the capparis<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> is found, a shrub with a wood<pb n="3207" />of much greater solidity. The seed of it is a well-knownarticle of food,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and is mostly gathered together with the stalk.It is as well, however, to be on our guard against the foreignkinds;<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> for that of Arabia has certain deleterious properties,that from Africa is injurious to the gums, and that fromMarmarica is prejudicial to the womb and causes flatulencein all the organs. That of Apulia, too, is productive of vomiting, and causes derangement in the stomach and intestines.Some persons call this shrub "cynosbaton,"<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> others, again,"ophiostaphyle."<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The "caper-tree," the Capparis spinosa of Linnæus. Fée suggeststhat Pliny may possibly allude, in some of the features which he describes,to kinds less known; such, for instance, as the Capparis inermis of Forsk-hal, found in Arabia; the Capparis ovata of Desfontaines, found in Barbary; the Capparis Sinaica, found on Mount Sinai, and remarkable forthe size of its fruit; and the Capparis Ægyptiaca of Lamarck, commonlyfound in Egypt.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The stalk and seed were salted or pickled. The buds or unexpandedflowers of this shrub are admired as a pickle or sauce of delicate flavour.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Fée remarks that this is not the truth, all the kinds possessing thesame qualities. There may, however, have been some difference in themode of salting or pickling them, and possibly productive of noxiouseffects.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably from its thorns, that being the name of the sweet-briar, ordog-rose.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Serpent grapes."</p></body>
