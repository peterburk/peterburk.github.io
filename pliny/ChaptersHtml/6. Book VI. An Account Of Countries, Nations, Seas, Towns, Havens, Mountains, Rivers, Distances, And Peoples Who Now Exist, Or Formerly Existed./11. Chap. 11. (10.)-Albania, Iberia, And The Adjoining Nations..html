(10.)â€”ALBANIA, IBERIA, AND THE ADJOINING NATIONS.</head><p>The whole plain which extends away from the river Cyrusis inhabited by the nation of the Albani,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and, after them,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>by that of the Iberi,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> who are separated from them by the riverAlazon,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> which flows into the Cyrus from the Caucasian<pb n="2021" />chain. The chief cities are Cabalaca,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> in Albania, Harmastis,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>near a river<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> of Iberia, and Neoris; there is the region alsoof Thasie, and that of Triare, extending as far as the mountains known as the Paryadres. Beyond these<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> are the desertsof Colchios, on the side of which that looks towards the Ceraunian Mountains dwell the Armenochalybes;<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> and there isthe country of the Moschi, extending to the river Iberus,which flows into the Cyrus; below them are the Sacassani,and after them the Macrones, upon the river Absarus. Suchis the manner in which the plains and low country are parcelled out. Again, after passing the confines of Albania, thewild tribes of the Silvi inhabit the face of the mountains,below them those of the Lubieni, and after them the Diduriand the Sodii.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">According to Strabo, Albania was bounded on the east by the Caspian,and on the north by the Caucasus. On the west it joined Iberia, while onthe south it was divided from the Greater Armenia by the river Cyrus.By later writers, the northern and western boundaries are differentlygiven. It was found to be the fact that the Albani occupied the countryon both sides of the Caucasus, and accordingly Pliny, in c. 15, carriesthe country further north, as far as the river Casius, while in this Chapterhe makes the river Alazon, the modern Alasan, the western boundary towards Iberia.
