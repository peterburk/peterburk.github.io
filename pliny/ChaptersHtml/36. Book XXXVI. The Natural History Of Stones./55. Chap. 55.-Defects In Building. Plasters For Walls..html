PLASTERS FOR WALLS.</head><p>The great cause of the fall of so many buildings in our City, is,that through a fraudulent abstraction of the lime, the roughwork is laid without anything to hold it together. Theolder, too, the mortar is, the better it is in quality. In theancient laws for the regulation of building, no contractor wasto use mortar less than three months old; hence it is, that nocracks have disfigured the plaster coatings of their walls.These stuccos will never present a sufficiently bright surface,unless there have been three layers of sanded mortar, and twoof marbled<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> mortar upon that. In damp localities and placessubject to exhalations from the sea, it is the best plan to substituteground earthenware mortar for sanded mortar. InGreece, it is the practice, first to pound the lime and sand usedfor plastering, with wooden pestles in a large trough. The testby which it is known that marbled mortar has been properlyblended, is its not adhering to the trowel; whereas, if it isonly wanted for white-washing, the lime, after being wellslaked with water, should stick like glue. For this lastpurpose, however, the lime should only be slaked in lumps.</p><p>At Elis, there is a Temple of Minerva, which was pargetted,they say, by Pan¾nus, the brother of Phidias, with a mortarthat was blended with milk and saffron:<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> hence it is, that,even at the present day, when rubbed with spittle on thefinger, it yields the smell and flavour of saffron.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pounded marble mixed with quicklime.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Lacte et croco" appears to be a preferable reading to "late e croco,"as given by the Bamberg MS.</p></body>
