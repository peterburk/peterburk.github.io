<div2 type="chapter" n="15" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 15.—THE PERSONS WHO HAVE POSSESSED THE GREATEST QUANTITY OF GOLD AND SILVER.</head><p>For my own part, I am much surprised that the Roman peoplehas always imposed upon conquered nations a tribute insilver, and not in gold; Carthage, for instance, from which,upon its conquest under Hannibal, a ransom was exacted inthe shape of a yearly<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> payment, for fifty years, of eight hundredthousand pounds' weight of silver, but no gold. And yetit does not appear that this could have arisen from there beingso little gold then in use throughout the world. Midas andCrœsus, before this, had possessed gold to an endless amount:Cyrus, already, on his conquest of Asia,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> had found a bootyconsisting of twenty-four thousand pounds' weight of gold,in addition to vessels and other articles of wrought gold, aswell as leaves<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> of trees, a plane-tree, and a vine, all made ofthat metal.</p><p>It was through this conquest too, that he carried off fivehundred thousand<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> talents of silver, as well as the vase ofSemiramis,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> the weight of which alone amounted to fifteentalents, the Egyptian talent being equal, according to Varro,to eighty of our pounds. Before this time too, Saulaces, thedescendant of Æëtes, had reigned in Colchis,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> who, on finding<pb n="6094" />a tract of virgin earth, in the country of the Suani,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> extractedfrom it a large amount of gold and silver, it is said, and whosekingdom besides, had been famed for the possession of theGolden Fleece. The golden arches, too, of his palace, we findspoken of, the silver supports and columns, and pilasters, allof which he had come into possession of on the conquest ofSesostris,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> king of Egypt; a monarch so haughty, that everyyear, it is said, it was his practice to select one of his vassalkings by lot, and yoking him to his car, celebrate his triumphafresh.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Appian and Livy mention the fine as consisting of ten thousandtalents <hi rend="ital">in all,</hi> or in other words, eight hundred thousand pounds of silver(at eighty pounds to the talent). Sillig is therefore of opinion that Plinyis in error here in inserting the word "annua." The payment of the tenthousand talents, we learn from the same authorities, was spread over fiftyyears.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Asia Minor.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Folia." Hardouin prefers the reading "solia," meaning "thrones,"or "chairs of state," probably.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ajasson refuses to place credit in this statement.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This vase of Semiramis was her drinking bowl, in much the samesense that the great cannon at Dover was Queen Elizabeth's "pocketpistol."</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The country to which, in previous times, the Argonauts had sailed inquest of the Golden Fleece, or in other words in search of gold, in whichthose regions were probably very prolific.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. vi. c. 4.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This story of the defeat of the great Ramses-Sesostris by a petty kingof Colchis, would almost appear apocryphal. It is not improbable, however, that Sesostris, when on his Thracian expedition, may have receiveda repulse on penetrating further north, accustomed as his troops must havebeen, to a warmer climate.</p></body>
