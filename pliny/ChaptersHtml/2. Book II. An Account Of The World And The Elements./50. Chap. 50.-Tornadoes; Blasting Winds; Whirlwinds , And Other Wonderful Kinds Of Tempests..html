The same, whenit is more burning and rages with greater heat, is called ablasting wind<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>, scorching and, at the same time, throwingdown everything with which it comes in contact. (49.) Typhon nevercomes from the north, nor have we Ecnephiaswhen it snows, or when there is snow on the ground. If itbreaks the clouds, and, at the same time, catches fire orburns, but not until it has left the cloud, it forms a thunderbolt.It differs from Prester as flame does from fire; theformer is diffused in a gust, the latter is condensed with aviolent impulse<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>. The whirlwind, when it rebounds, differsfrom the tornado in the same manner as a loud noise doesfrom a dash.</p><p>The squall differs from both of them in its extent, theclouds being more properly rent asunder than broken intopieces. A black cloud is formed, resembling a great animal,an appearance much dreaded by sailors. It is also called apillar, when the moisture is so condensed and rigid as to beable to support itself. It is a cloud of the same kind, which,when drawn into a tube, sucks up the water<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The terms here employed are respectively "turbines," "presteres,"and "vortices."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot"><foreign lang="greek">prhsth\o,</foreign> a <foreign lang="greek">prh/qw,</foreign> incendo.
