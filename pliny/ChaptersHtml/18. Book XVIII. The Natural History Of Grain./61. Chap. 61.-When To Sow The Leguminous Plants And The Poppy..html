<div2 type="chapter" n="61" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 61.—WHEN TO SOW THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS AND THEPOPPY.</head><p>Varro<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> has given no other sign but this<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> for our guidancein sowing the bean. Some persons are of opinion that it shouldbe sown at full moon, the lentil between the twenty-fifth andthirtieth day of the moon, and the vetch on the same days ofthe moon; and they assure us that if this is done they will beexempt from the attacks of slugs. Some say, however, thatif wanted for fodder, they may be sown at these periods, butif for seed, in the spring. There is another sign, more evidentstill, supplied us by the marvellous foresight of Nature, withreference to which we will give the words employed by Cicero<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>himself:<lb />"The lentisk, ever green and ever bent<lb />Beneath its fruits, affords a threefold crop:<lb />Thrice teeming, thrice it warns us when to plough."</p><p>One of the periods here alluded to, is the same that is nowunder consideration, being the appropriate time also for sowingflax and the poppy.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> With reference to this last, Cato gives thefollowing advice: "Burn, upon land where corn has been grown,the twigs and branches which are of no use to you, and whenthat is done, sow the poppy there." The wild poppy, whichis of an utility that is quite marvellous, is boiled in honey as aremedy for diseases in the throat,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> while the cultivated kind isa powerful narcotic. Thus much in reference to winter sowing.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">De Re Rust. i. 34.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The setting of the Vergiliæ.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">De Divinat.
