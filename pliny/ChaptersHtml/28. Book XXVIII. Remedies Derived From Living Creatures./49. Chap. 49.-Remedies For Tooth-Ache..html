<div2 type="chapter" n="49" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 49.—REMEDIES FOR TOOTH-ACHE.</head><p>The ashes of deer's horns strengthen loose teeth and allaytooth-ache, used either as a friction or as a gargle. Some persons,however, are of opinion that the horn, unburnt and reduced topowder, is still more efficacious for all these purposes. Dentifrices are made both from the powder and the ashes. Another<pb n="5339" />excellent remedy is a wolf's head, reduced to ashes: it is awell-known fact, too, that there are bones generally found inthe excrements of that animal; these bones, attached to thebody as an amulet, are productive of advantageous effects. Forthe cure of tooth-ache, hare's rennet is injected into the ear:the head also of that animal, reduced to ashes, is used in theform of a dentifrice, and, with the addition of nard, is a corrective of bad breath. Some persons, however, think it a betterplan to mix the ashes of a mouse's head with the dentifrice.In the side of the hare there is a bone found, similar to aneedle in appearance: for the cure of tooth-ache it is recommended to scarify the gums with this bone. The pastern-boneof an ox, ignited and applied to loose teeth which ache, hasthe effect of strengthening them in the sockets; the same bone,reduced to ashes, and mixed with myrrh, is also used as a dentifrice. The ashes of burnt pig's feet are productive of a similareffect, as also the calcined bones of the cotyloïd cavities in whichthe hip-bones move. It is a well-known fact, that, introducedinto the throat of beasts of burden, these bones are a cure forworms, and that, in a calcined state, they are good for strength-ening the teeth.</p><p>When the teeth have been loosened by a blow, they arestrengthened by using asses' milk, or else ashes of the burntteeth of that animal, or a horse's lichen, reduced to powder,and injected into the car with oil. By lichen<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> I do not meanthe hippomanes, a noxious substance which I purposely forbearto enlarge upon, but an excrescence which forms upon theknees of horses, and just above the hoofs. In the heart<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> ofthis animal there is also found a bone which bears a closeresemblance to the eye-teeth of a dog: if the gums are scarifiedwith this bone, or with a tooth taken from the jaw-bone of adead horse, corresponding in place with the tooth affected, thepain will be removed, they say. Anaxilaüs assures us that ifthe liquid which exudes from a mare when covered, is ignitedon the wick of a lamp, it will give out a most marvellousrepresentation<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> of horses' heads; and the same with reference<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span><pb n="5340" />to the she-ass. As to the hippomanes, it is possessed of properties so virulent and so truly magical, that if it is only throwninto fused metal<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> which is being cast into the resemblance ofan Olympian mare, it will excite in all stallions that approachit a perfect frenzy for copulation.</p><p>Another remedy for diseases of the teeth is joiners' glue,boiled in water and applied, care being taken to remove it veryspeedily, and instantly to rinse the teeth with wine in whichsweet pomegranate-rind has been boiled. It is, considered,also, a very efficacious remedy to wash the teeth with goats'milk, or bull's gall. The pastern-bones of a she-goat justkilled, reduced to ashes, and indeed, to avoid the necessity forrepetition, of any other four-footed beast reared in the farmyard, are considered to make an excellent dentifrice.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. viii. c. 66.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xi. c. 70.
