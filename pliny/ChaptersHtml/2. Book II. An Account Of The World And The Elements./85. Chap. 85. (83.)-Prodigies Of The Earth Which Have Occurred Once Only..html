(83.)—PRODIGIES OF THE EARTH WHICH HAVEOCCURRED ONCE ONLY.</head><p>A great prodigy of the earth, which never happened morethan once, I have found mentioned in the books of the Etruscanceremonies, as having taken place in the district of Mutina,during the consulship of Lucius Martius and Sextus Julius<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>.Two mountains rushed together, falling upon each otherwith a very loud crash, and then receding; while in the daytime flameand smoke issued from them; a great crowd ofRoman knights, and families of people, and travellers on theÆmilian way, being spectators of it. All the farm-houseswere thrown down by the shock, and a great number ofanimals that were in them were killed; it was in the yearbefore the Social war; and I am in doubt whether this eventor the civil commotions were more fatal to the territory ofItaly. The prodigy which happened in our own age was noless wonderful; in the last year of the emperor Nero<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>, as Ihave related in my history of his times<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>, when certain fieldsand olive grounds in the district of Marrucinum, belongingto Vectius Marcellus, a Roman knight, the steward of Nero,<pb n="1116" />changed places with each other<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, although the public highway was interposed.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In the year of the city 663; A.C. 90.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In the year of the city 821; A.D. <date value="68" authname="68">68</date>.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The continuation of Aufidius Bassus' history; our author refersto it in the first book.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We have no authentic accounts of this mutual change of placebetween two portions of land, nor can we conceive of any causecapable ofeffecting it.
