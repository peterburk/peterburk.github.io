The root, however, should be taken upone day, and boiled the next, the proportion of it being onesextarius to two cyathi of wine. Some persons beat up theroot raw, and take it in water: it is generally considered, too,that there is nothing in existence more beneficial to the maleorgans than the young stalks of the plant, beaten up and usedwith vinegar.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See c. 50, and B. xxiii. c. 83.
