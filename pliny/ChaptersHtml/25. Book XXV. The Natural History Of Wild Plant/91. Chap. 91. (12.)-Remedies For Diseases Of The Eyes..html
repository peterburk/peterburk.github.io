(12.)ÑREMEDIES FOR DISEASES OF THE EYES.</head><p>It is generally thought that the greater centaury<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> strengthensthe sight, if the eyes are fomented with it steeped in water;and that by employing the juice of the smaller kind, in combination with honey, films and cloudiness may be dispersed,marks obliterated, and small flies removed which have gotinto the eve. It is thought also that sideritis is curative ofalbugo in beasts of burden. As to chelidonia,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> it is marvellously good for all the affections above mentioned. Root ofpanaces<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> is applied, with polenta,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> to defluxions of the eyes;and for the purpose of keeping them down, henbane-seed istaken, in doses of one obolus, with an equal proportion ofopium, in wine. Juice, too, of gentian is used as a lini-ment, and it sometimes forms an ingredient in the more active eyesalves,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> as a substitute for meconium. Euphorbia,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>applied in the form of a liniment, improves the eyesight,and for ophthalmia juice of plantago<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> is injected into theeyes.</p><p>Aristolochia disperses films upon the eyes; and iberis,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>attached to the head with cinquefoil, is curative of defluxionsand other diseases of the eyes. Verbascum<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> is applied topically to defluxions of the eyes, and vervain is used for asimilar purpose, with rose oil and vinegar. For the treatment of cataract and dimness of sight, cyclaminos is reducedto a pulp and divided into lozenges. Juice, too, of peu-cedanum, as already mentioned,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> mixed with meconium and oilof roses, is good for the sight, and disperses films upon theeyes. Psyllion,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> applied to the forehead, arrests defluxions ofthe eyes.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">All the plants here mentioned are of a more or less irritating nature,and would greatly imperil the sight.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See c. 50 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See c. 11 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B.xviii.c.14, and B.xxii.c.59.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">most dangerous application, in reality.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A most dangerous application, in reality.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A comparatively harmless, though useless application.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See c. 49 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See c. 73 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In c. 70 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See c. 90 of this Book.</p></body>
