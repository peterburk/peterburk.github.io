<div2 type="chapter" n="71" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 71.—THE MEDICAMENT CALLED STOMATICE, ARTERIACE, ORPANCHRESTOS. FOUR REMEDIES.</head><p>From the fruit of the mulberry a medicament is prepared,called "panchrestos,"<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> "stomatice," or "arteriace:" the following is the method employed. Three sextarii of the juice<pb n="4510" />are reduced, at a slow heat, to the consistency of honey; twodenarii of dried omphacium<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> or one of myrrh, with one denarius of saffron, are then added, the whole being beaten up together and mixed with the decoction. There is no medica-ment known that is more soothing than this, for affections ofthe mouth, the trachea, the uvula, and the stomach. Thereis also another mode of preparing it: two sextarii of mulberryjuice and one of Attic honey are boiled down in the mannerabove stated.</p><p>There are some other marvellous properties, also, which arementioned in reference to this tree. When the tree is in bud,and before the appearance of the leaves, the germs of the fruitmust be gathered with the left hand—the Greeks give themthe name of "ricini."<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> These germs, worn as anamulet before they have touchedthe ground, have the effect of arrestinghæmrrhage, whether proceeding from a wound,from themouth, from the nostrils, or from piles; for which purposesthey are, accordingly, put away and kept. Similar virtuesare attributed to a branch just beginning to bear, broken off atfull moon, provided also it has not touched the ground: thisbranch, it is said, attached to the arm, is peculiarly efficaciousfor the suppression of the catamenia when in excess. Thesame effect is produced, it is said, when the woman herselfpulls it off, whatever time it may happen to be, care beingtaken not to let it touch the ground, and to wear it attached tothe body. The leaves of the mulberry-tree beaten up fresh,or a decoction of them dried, are applied topically for stingsinflicted by serpents: an infusion of them, taken in drink, isequally efficacious for that purpose. The juice extracted fromthe bark of the root, taken in wine or oxycrate, counteractsthe venom of the scorpion.</p><p>We must also give some account of the method of preparingthis medicament employed by the ancients: extracting thejuice from the fruit, both ripe and unripe, they mixed it to-gether, and then boiled it down in a copper vessel to the con-<pb n="4511" />sistency of honey. Some persons were in the habit of addingmyrrh and cypress, and then left it to harden in the sun, mixingit with a spatula three times a-day. Such was their receipt forthe stomatice, which was also employed by them to promotethe cicatrization of wounds. There was another method, also,of dealing with the juice of this fruit: extracting the juice,they used the dried fruit with various articles of food,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> astending to heighten the flavour; and they were in the habitof employing it medicinally<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> for corroding ulcers, pituitousexpectorations, and all cases in which astringents were required for the viscera. They used it also for the purpose ofcleaning<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> the teeth. A third mode of employing the juices ofthis tree is to boil down the leaves and root, the decoctionbeing used, with oil,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> as a liniment for the cure of burns.The leaves are also applied by themselves for the samepurpose.</p><p>An incision made in the root at harvest-time, supplies ajuice that is extremely useful for tooth-ache, gatherings, andsuppurations; it acts, also, as a purgative upon the bowels.Mulberry-leaves, macerated in urine, remove the hair fromhides.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"All-healing," "mouth-medicine," and "medicine for the trachea."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xii. c. 60.
