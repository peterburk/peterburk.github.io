For otter kinds of ulcers butter is used, as adetergent, and as tending to make new flesh; ashes of deer'santlers, or deer's marrow; or else bull's gall, mixed withoil of cyprus<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> or oil of iris. Wounds inflicted with edgedweapons are rubbed with fresh swine's dung, or with driedswine's dung, powdered. When ulcers are phagedænic orfistulous, bull's gall is injected, with leek-juice or woman'smilk; or else bull's blood, dried and powdered, with the plantcotyledon.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span></p><p>Carcinomatous sores are treated with hare's rennet, sprin-kled upon them with an equal proportion of capers in wine;gangrenes, with bears' grease, applied with a feather; andulcers of a serpiginous nature with the ashes of an ass's hoofs,powdered upon then. The blood of the horse corrodes theflesh by virtue of certain septic powers which it possesses;dried horse-dung, too, reduced to ashes, has a similar effect.Those kinds of ulcer which are commonly known as "phagedænic," are treated with the ashes of a cow's hide, mixed withhoney. Calves' flesh, as also cow-dung mixed with honey, prevents recent wounds from swelling. The ashes of a leg of veal,applied with woman's milk, are a cure for sordid ulcers, and themalignant sore known s "cacoëthes:"<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> bull-glue, melted, is<pb n="5360" />applied to recent wounds inflicted with edged weapons, theapplication being removed before the end of three days. Driedgoats' milk cheese, applied with vinegar and honey, acts as adetergent upon ulcers; and goat suet, used in combinationwith wax, arrests the spread of serpiginous sores if employedwith pitch and sulphur, it will effect a thorough cure. Theashes of a kid's leg, applied with woman's milk, have a similareffect upon malignant ulcers; for the cure, too, of carbuncles, asow's brains are roasted and applied.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xii. c. 51.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxv. c. 101.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Bad habit."
