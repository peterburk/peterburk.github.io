<div2 type="chapter" n="7" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 7.—OF THE ECLIPSES OF THE MOON AND THE SUN.</head><p>For it is evident that the sun is hid by the intervention<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>of the moon, and the moon by the opposition<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> of the earth,and that these changes are mutual, the moon, by her interposition<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>,taking the rays of the sun from the earth, and theearth from the moon. As she advances darkness is suddenlyproduced, and again the sun is obscured by her shade; fornight is nothing more than the shade of the earth. Thefigure of this shade is like that of a pyramid or an invertedtop<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>; and the moon enters it only near its point, and it doesnot exceed the height of the moon, for there is no other starwhich is obscured in the same manner, while a figure of thiskind always terminates in a point. The flight of birds, whenvery lofty, shows that shadows do not extend beyond a certaindistance; their limit appears to be the termination of theair and the commencement of the æther. Above the mooneverything is pure and full of an eternal light. The starsare visible to us in the night, in the same way that otherluminous bodies are seen in the dark. It is from these causesthat the moon is eclipsed during the night<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>. The two kindsof eclipses are not, however, at the stated monthly periods,on account of the obliquity of the zodiac, and the irregularlywandering course of the moon, as stated above; besides thatthe motions of these stars do not always occur exactly at thesame points<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>.<pb n="1035" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The terms here employed are respectively <hi rend="ital">interventus, objectio,</hi> and<hi rend="ital">interpositus;</hi> it may be doubted whether the author intended to employthem in the precise sense which is indicated by their etymology.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The terms here employed are respectively <hi rend="ital">interventus, objectio,</hi> and<hi rend="ital">interpositus;</hi> it may be doubted whether the author intended to employthem in the precise sense which is indicated by their etymology.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The terms here employed are respectively <hi rend="ital">interventus, objectio,</hi> and<hi rend="ital">interpositus;</hi> it may be doubted whether the author intended to employthem in the precise sense which is indicated by their etymology.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"metæ et turbini inverso."

Const. vi. 6–11, gives a full andgenerally correct account of the principal phenomena ofeclipses.</p></body>
