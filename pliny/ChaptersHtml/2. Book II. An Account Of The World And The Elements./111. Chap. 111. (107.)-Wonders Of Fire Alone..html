<div2 type="chapter" n="111" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 111. (107.)ÑWONDERS OF FIRE ALONE.</head><p>But since this one element is of so prolific a nature as toproduce itself, and to increase from the smallest spark, whatmust we suppose will be the effect of all those funeral piles<pb n="1142" />of the earth<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> ? What must be the nature of that thing,which, in all parts of the world, supplies this most greedyvoracity without destroying itself? To these fires must beadded those innumerable stars and the great sun itself. Thereare also the fires made by men<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>,those which are innate incertain kinds of stones, those produced by the friction ofwood<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>, and those in the clouds, which give rise to lightning.It really exceeds all other wonders, that one single dayshould pass in which everything is not consumed, especiallywhen we reflect, that concave mirrors placed opposite to thesun's rays produce flame more readily than any other kind offire; and that numerous small but natural fires abound everywhere. In Nymph¾umthere issues from a rock a fire whichis kindled by rain; it also issues from the waters of the Scantia<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>. This indeed is afeeble flame, since it passes off, remaining only a short time on any body towhich it is applied:an ash tree, which overshadows this fiery spring, remainsalways green<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>. In the territory of Mutina fire issues fromthe ground on the days that are consecrated to Vulcan<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>.It is stated by some authors, that if a burning body fallson the fields below Aricia<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>, the ground is set on fire; andthat the stones in the territory of the Sabines and of theSidicini<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>, if they be oiled, burn with flame. InEgnatia<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>, a<pb n="1143" />town of Salentinum, there is a sacred stone, upon which, whenwood is placed, flame immediately bursts forth. In the altarof Juno Lacinia<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>, which is in the open air, the ashes remainunmoved, although the winds may be blowing from allquarters.</p><p>It appears also that there are sudden fires both in watersand even in the human body; that the whole of Lake Thrasymenus was on fire<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>;that when Servius Tullius, while a child,was sleeping, flame darted out from his head<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>; and ValeriusAntias informs us, that the same flame appeared about L.Marcius, when he was pronouncing the funeral oration overthe Scipios, who were killed in Spain; and exhorting thesoldiers to avenge their death. I shall presently mentionmore facts of this nature, and in a more distinct manner; inthis place these wonders are mixed up with other subjects.But my mind, having carried me beyond the mere interpretation of nature, is anxious to lead, as it were by the hand,the thoughts of my readers over the whole globe.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Tot rogis terr¾ ?" in reference to the remark in a formerchapter,"natura terras cremat."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Humani ignes," according to Hardouin, "Hinostri ignes, quos vit¾usus requirit, ut Tullius ait de Nat.
