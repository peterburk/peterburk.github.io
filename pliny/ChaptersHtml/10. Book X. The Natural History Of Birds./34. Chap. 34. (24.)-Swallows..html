(24.)—SWALLOWS.</head><p>The swallow, the only bird that is carnivorous among thosewhich have not hooked talons, takes its departure also duringthe winter months; but it only goes to neighbouring countries,seeking sunny retreats there on the mountain sides; sometimes they have been found in such spots bare and quite unfledged. This bird, it is said, will not enter a house in Thebes,because that city has been captured so frequently; nor will itapproach the country of the Bizyæ, on account of the crimescommitted there by Tereus.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> Cæcina<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> of Volaterræ, a memberof the equestrian order, and the owner of several chariots, usedto have swallows caught, and then carried them with him toRome. Upon gaining a victory, he would send the newsby them to his friends; for after staining them the colour<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> ofthe party that had gained the day, he would let them go,immediately upon which they would make their way to thenests they had previously occupied. Fabius Pictor also relates,in his Annals, that when a Roman garrison was being besiegedby the Ligurians, a swallow which had been taken from itsyoung ones was brought to him, inorder that he might givethem notice, by the number of knots on a string tied to itsleg, on what day succour would arrive, and a sortie might bemade with advantage.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. iv. c. 18.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A friend of Augustus, sent by him with proposals to Antony, B.C. <date value="-41" authname="-41">41</date>.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The colour of the "factio," or "party" of charioteers.
