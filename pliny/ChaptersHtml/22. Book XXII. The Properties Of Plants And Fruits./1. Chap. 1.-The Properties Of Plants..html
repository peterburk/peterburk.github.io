And yet, how much is therestill left for us to describe, and how many discoveries of a stillmore astonishing nature! The greater part, in fact, of theplants there mentioned recommend themselves to us by theirtaste, their fragrance, or their beauty, and so invite us tomake repeated trials of their virtues: but, on the other hand.the properties of those which remain to be described, furnishus with abundant proof that nothing has been created by Naturewithout some purpose to fulfil, unrevealed to us though itmay be.</p></div2></body>
