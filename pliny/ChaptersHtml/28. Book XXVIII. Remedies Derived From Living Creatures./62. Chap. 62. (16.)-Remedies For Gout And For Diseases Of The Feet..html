<div2 type="chapter" n="62" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 62. (16.)â€”REMEDIES FOR GOUT AND FOR DISEASES OFTHE FEET.</head><p>For the cure of gout, bears' grease is employed, mixed inequal proportions with bull-suet and wax; some persons addto the composition, hypocisthis<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and nut-galls. Others, again,prefer he-goat suet, mixed with the dung of a she-goat andsaffron, or else with mustard, or sprigs of ivy pounded andused with perdicium,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> or with flowers of wild cucumber. Cowdung is also used, with lees of vinegar. Some persons speakhighly in praise of the dung of a calf which has not begun tograze, or else a bull's blood, without any other addition; a<hi rend="ital">fox,</hi> also, boiled alive till only the bones are left; a wolf boiledalive in oil to the consistency of a cerate; he-goat suet, withan equal proportion of helxine,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and one-third part of mustard; or ashes of goats' dung, mixed with axle-grease. Theysay, too, that for sciatica, it is an excellent plan to apply thisdung boiling<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> hot beneath the great toes; and that, for diseasesof the joints, it is highly efficacious to attach bears' gall orhares' feet to the part affected. Gout, they say, may be allayedby the patient always carrying about with him a hare's foot,cut off from the animal alive.</p><p>Bears' grease is a cure for chilblains and all kinds of chapsupon the feet; with the addition of alum, it is still more efficacious. The same results are produced by using goat-suet;a horse's teeth powdered; the gall of a wild boar or hog; orelse the lights of those animals, applied with their grease; andthis, too, where the soles are blistered, or the feet have beencrushed by a substance striking against them. In cases wherethe feet have been frozen, ashes of burnt hare's fur are used;and for contusions of the feet, the lights of that animal areapplied, sliced or reduced to ashes. Blisters occasioned by thesun are most effectually treated by using asses' fat, or elsebeef-suet, with oil of roses. Corns, chaps, and callosities ofthe feet are cured by the application of wild boars' dung orswine's dung, used fresh, and removed at the end of a couple<pb n="5353" />of days. The pastern-bones of these animals are also used, reduced to ashes; or else the lights of a wild boar, swine, or deer.When the feet have been galled by the shoes, they are rubbedwith the urine of an ass, applied with the mud formed by itupon the ground. Corns are treated with beef-suet and powdered frankincense; chilblains with burnt leather, that of anold shoe, in particular; and injuries produced by tight shoeswith ashes of goat-skin, tempered with oil.</p><p>The pains attendant upon varicose veins are mitigated byusing ashes of burnt calves' dung, boiled with lily roots and alittle honey: a composition which is equally good for all kindsof inflammations and sores that tend to suppurate. It is veryuseful, also, for gout and diseases of the joints, when it is thedung of a bull-calf that is used more particularly. For excoriations of the joints, the gall of a wild boar or swine is applied,in a warm linen cloth: the dung, also, of a calf that has notbegun to graze; or else goat-dung, boiled in vinegar with honey.Veal-suet rectifies malformed nails, as also goat-suet, mixed withsandarach. Warts are removed by applying ashes of burntcalves' dung in vinegar, or else the mud formed upon the groundby the urine of an ass.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxvi. c. 31.
