<div2 type="chapter" n="26" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 26.ÑNARD. THE TWELVE VARIETIES OF THE PLANT.</head><p>Of the leaf, which is that of the nard,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> it is only right tospeak somewhat more at length, as it holds the principal placeamong our unguents. The nard is a shrub with a heavy,thick root, but short, black, brittle, and yet unctuous as well;<pb n="3120" />it has a musty smell, too, very much like that of the cyperus,with a sharp, acrid taste, the leaves being small, and growingin tufts. The heads of the nard spread out into ears; henceit is that nard is so famous for its two-fold production, thespike or ear, and the leaf. There is another kind, again, thatgrows on the banks of the Ganges, but is altogether condemned, as being good for nothing; it bears the name ofoz¾nitis,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and emits a fetid odour. Nard is adulteratedwith a sort of plant called pseudo-nard,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> which is foundgrowing everywhere, and is known by its thick, broad leaf,and its sickly colour, which inclines to white. It is sophisticated, also, by being mixed with the root of the genuinenard, which adds very considerably to its weight. Gum isalso used for the same purpose, antimony, and cyperus; or,at least, the outer coat of the cyperus. Its genuineness is testedby its lightness, the redness of its colour, its sweet smell, andthe taste more particularly, which parches the mouth, andleaves a pleasant flavour behind it; the price of spikenard isone hundred denarii per pound.</p><p>Leaf<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> nard varies in price according to the size; for thatwhich is known by the name of hadrosph¾rum, consisting ofthe larger leaves, sells at forty denarii per pound; when theleaves are smaller, it is called mesosph¾rum, and is sold atsixty. But that which is considered the most valuable of all,is known as microsph¾rum, and consists of the very smallestof the leaves; it sells at seventy-five denarii per pound. Allthese varieties of nard have an agreeable odour, but it is mostpowerful when fresh. If the nard is old when gathered, thatwhich is of a black colour is considered the best.</p><p>In our part of the world, the Syrian<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> nard is held in the<pb n="3121" />next highest esteem next to this; then the Gallic;<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> and inthe third place, that of Crete,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> which by some persons iscalled "agrion," and by others "phu." This last has exactly theleaf of the olusatrum,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> with a stalk a cubit in length, knotted,of a whitish colour, inclining to purple, and a root that runssideways; it is covered, too, with long hair, and stronglyresembles the foot of a bird. Field nard is known by thename of baccar.<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> We shall have further occasion to mentionit when we come to speak of the flowers. All these kinds ofnard, however, are to be reckoned as herbs, with the exceptionof Indian nard. Of these, the Gallic kind is pulled up alongwith the root, and washed in wine; after which it is dried inthe shade, and wrapped up in paper, in small parcels. It isnot very different from the Indian nard, but is lighter thanthat of Syria; the price at which it sells is three denarii perpound. The only way of testing the leaves of all thesevarieties of nard, is to see that they are not brittle and parched,instead of being dried naturally and gradually. Togetherwith the nard that grows in Gaul, there always<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> springs upa herb, which is known by the name of hirculus, or the"little goat," on account of its offensive smell, it being verysimilar to that of the goat. This herb, too, is very much usedin the adulteration of nard, though it differs from it in thefact that it has no stem, and its leaves are smaller; the root,too, is not bitter, and is entirely destitute of smell.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is probable that the nard of the ancients, from which they extractedthe famous nard-oil, was not the same plant which we know as the Indiannard, or Andropogon nardus of Linn¾us. Indeed, it has been pretty conclusively established by Sir William Jones, in his "Asiatic Researches,"that the Valeriana Jatamansi is the plant from which they obtained the oil.Among the Hindoos, it is known as djat‰mansi, and by the Arabs underthe name of sombul, or "spike," from the fact of the base being surroundedwith ears or spikes, whence, probably, the Roman appellation. This species of valerian grows in the more distant and mountainous parts of India,Bootan and Nepaul, for instance.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From the Greek, <foreign lang="greek">o(/zaina,</foreign> "a putrid sore." FŽe suggests that thismay have been the Nardus hadrosph¾rum of the moderns.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">FŽe supposes that this is not lavender, as some have thought, but theAllium victorialis of modern naturalists, which is still mixed with the nardfrom the Andropogon. He doubts the possibility of its having been adulterated with substances of such a different nature as those mentioned hereby Pliny.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">FŽe is of opinion, that the Greek writers, from whom Pliny copiedthis passage, intended to speak of the ears of nard, or spikenard.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">According to Dioscorides, this appellation only means such nard as iscultivated in certain mountains of India which look toward Syria, andwhich, according to that author, was the best nard of all. Dalechamps andHardouin, however, ridicule this explanation of the term.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Generally supposed to be the Valeriana Celtica of modern naturalists.See B. xxi. c. 79.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably the Valeriana Italica of modern naturalists.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xix. c. 48.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Known in this country as fox-glove, our Lady's gloves, sage of Jerusalem, or clown's spikenard. See B. xxi. c. 16.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Not always, but very seldom, Brotier says. Clusius has established,from observation, that this plant is only a variety of the Valeriana Celtica.</p></body>
