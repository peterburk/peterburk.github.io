<div2 type="chapter" n="4" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 4.—THE NATURAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE EAGLE.</head><p>The first three and the fifth class of eagles employ in theconstruction of their aerie the stone aëtites,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> by some knownas "gangites;" which is employed also for many remedialpurposes, and is proof against the action of fire. This stonehas the quality also, in a manner, of being pregnant, for whenshaken, another stone is heard to rattle within, just as thoughit were enclosed in its womb; it has no medical properties,however, except immediately after it has been taken from thenest.</p><p>Eagles build among rocks and trees; they lay three eggs,and generally hatch but two young ones, though occasionallyas many as three have been seen. Being weary of the troubleof rearing both, they drive one of them from the nest: forjust at this time the providential foresight of Nature has deniedthem a sufficiency of food, thereby using due precaution thatthe young of all the other animals should not become theirprey. During this period, also, their talons become reversed,and their feathers grow white from continued hunger, so thatit is not to be wondered at that they take a dislike to their<pb n="2485" />young. The ossifrage, however, a kindred species, takes chargeof the young ones thus rejected, and rears them with its own;but the parent bird still pursues them with hostility, evenwhen grown up, and drives them away, as being its rivals inrapine. And indeed, under any circumstances, one pair ofeagles requires a very considerable space of ground to forageover, in order to find sufficient sustenance; for which reasonit is that they mark out by boundaries their respective allotments, and seek their prey in succession to one another. Theydo not immediately carry off their prey, but first deposit it onthe ground, and it is only after they have tested its weightthat they fly away with it.</p><p>They die, not of old age, nor yet of sickness, or of hunger;but the upper part of the beak grows to such an extent, andbecomes so curved, that they are unable to open it. Theytake the wing, and begin upon the labours of the chase atmid-day; sitting in idleness during the hours of the morning,until such time as the places<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> of public resort are filled withpeople. The feathers of the eagle, if mixed with those ofother birds, will consume them.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> It is said that this is theonly bird that has never been killed by lightning; hence it is,that usage has pronounced it to be the armour—Bearer of Jove.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or eagle-stone.
