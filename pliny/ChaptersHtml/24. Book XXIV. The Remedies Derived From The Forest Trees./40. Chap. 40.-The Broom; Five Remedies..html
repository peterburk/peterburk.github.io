I have my doubts whether thisis not the same plant that the Greek writers have called"sparton," and of which, in those parts of the world, as I havealready<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> stated, they are in the habit of making fishing-nets.I doubt also whether Homer<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> has alluded to this plant, whenhe speaks of the seams of the ships,Ñ"the sparta" comingasunder; for it is certain that in those times the spartum<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> ofSpain or Africa was not as yet in use, and that vessels madeof materials sown together, were united by the agency, not ofspartum, but of flax.<pb n="5029" /></p><p>The seed of the plant to which the Greeks now give thename of "sparton," grows in pods like those of the kidneybean. It is as strongly drastic<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> as hellebore, and is usuallytaken fasting, in doses of one drachma and a half, in fourcyathi of hydromel. The branches also, with the foliage, aremacerated for several days in vinegar, and are then beaten up,the infusion being recommended for sciatica, in doses of onecyathus. Some persons think it a better plan, however, tomake an infusion of them in sea-water, and to inject it as aclyster. The juice of them is used also as a friction for sciatica,with the addition of oil. Some medical men, too, make useof the seed for strangury. Broom, bruised with axle-grease, isa cure for diseases of the knees.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xvi. c. 69.

FŽe thinks that the plant under consideration inthis Chapter is the Spanish broom, Genista juncea of Lamarck, the Spartium junceum of Linn¾us, a different plant from the Spartum of B. xix.c. 7, the Stipa tenacissima of Linn¾us. He is of opinion also, that Homerin the passage referred to alludes, not to flax, but to the Genista juncea. Seethis question further discussed, in the additional Note at the end of B. xxvii.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">FŽe says that the blossoms and seed of the junciform genista andother kinds are of a purgative nature; indeed, one variety has been calledthe Genista purgans by Lamarck. None of them, however, are so potentin their effects as Pliny in the present passage would lead us to suppose.</p></body>
