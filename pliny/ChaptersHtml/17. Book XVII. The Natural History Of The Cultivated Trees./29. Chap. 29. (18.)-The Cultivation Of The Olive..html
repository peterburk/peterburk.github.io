(18.)â€”THE CULTIVATION OF THE OLIVE.</head><p>Cato<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> has treated so well of the precautions that are necessary in cultivating the olive, that we cannot do better thanemploy his own words on the subject. "Let the slips ofolive," says he, "which you are about to plant in the hole, bethree feet long, and be very careful in your treatment of them,so as not to injure the bark when you are smoothing or cuttingthem. Those that you are going to plant in the nursery,should be a foot in length; and you should plant them thefollowing way: let the spot be turned up with the mattock,<pb n="3487" />and the soil be well loosened. When you put the cutting in theground, press it down with the foot only. If there is anydifficulty in making it descend, drive it down with a mallet orthe handle of the dibble, but be careful not to break the barkin doing so. Take care, too, not to make a hole first with thedibble, for the slip will have the better chance of surviving theother way. When the slip is three years old, due care must betaken to observe the direction in which each side of the bark issituate. If you are planting in holes or furrows, you mustput in the cuttings by threes, but be careful to keep themseparate. Above ground, however, they should not be morethan four fingers distant from one another, and each of themmust have a bud or eye above ground. In taking up the olivefor transplanting, you must use the greatest caution, and seethat there is as much earth left about the roots as possible.When you have covered the roots well up, tread down theearth with the foot, so that nothing may injure the plant."</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">De Re Rust. 45.
