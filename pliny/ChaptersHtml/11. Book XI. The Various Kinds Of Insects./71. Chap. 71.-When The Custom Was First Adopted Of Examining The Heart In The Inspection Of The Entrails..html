<div2 type="chapter" n="71" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 71.—WHEN THE CUSTOM WAS FIRST ADOPTED OF EXAMININGTHE HEART IN THE INSPECTION OF THE ENTRAILS.</head><p>On an examination of the entrails, to find a certain fattypart on the top of the heart, is looked upon as a fortunatepresage. Still, however the heart has not always been considered as forming a part of the entrails for this purpose. Itwas under Lucius Postumnius Albinus, the King of the Sacrifices,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and after the 126th Olympiad, when King Pyrrhus hadquitted Italy, that the aruspices began to examine the heart,as part of the consecrated entrails. The first day that theDictator Cæsar appeared in public, clothed in purple, and sitting on a seat of gold, the heart was twice found wanting<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>when he sacrificed. From this circumstance has risen a greatquestion among those who discuss matters connected withdivination—whether it was possible for the victim to havelived without that organ, or whether it had lost it at the verymoment<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> of its death. It is asserted that the heart cannot be<pb n="3067" />burnt of those persons who die of the cardiac disease; and thesame is said of those who die by poison. At all events, thereis still in existence an oration pronounced by Vitellius,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> inwhich he accuses Piso of this crime, and employs this allegedfact as one of his proofs, openly asserting that the heart ofGermanicus Cæsar could not be burnt at the funeral pile, inconsequence of his having been poisoned. On the other hand,the peculiar nature<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> of the disease under which Germanicuswas labouring, was alleged in Piso's defence.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">" Rex Sacrorum." This was a priest elected from the patricians, onwhom the priestly duties devolved, which had been originally performedby the kings of Rome. He ranked above the Pontifex Maximus, but waspossessed of little or no political influence.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">No doubt there was trickery in this.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">No doubt there was trickery in this.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This was P.
