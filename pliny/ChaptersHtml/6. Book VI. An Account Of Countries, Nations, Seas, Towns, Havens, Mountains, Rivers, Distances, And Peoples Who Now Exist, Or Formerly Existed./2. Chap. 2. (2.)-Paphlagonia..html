In it are Mastya,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> a town founded by the<pb n="2004" />Milesians, and then Cromna,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> at which spot Cornelius Nepos alsoplaces the Heneti,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> from whom he would have us believe thatthe Veneti of Italy, who have a similar name, are descended.The city also of Sesamon, now called Amastris,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> MountCytorus,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> distant sixty-three miles from Tium, the towns ofCimolis<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> and Stephane,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> and the river Parthenius.<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> Thepromontory of Carambis,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> which extends a great distance intothe sea, is distant from the mouth of the Euxine three hundredand twenty-five miles, or, according to some writers, threehundred and fifty, being the same distance from the CimmerianBosporus, or, as some persons think, only three hundred andtwelve miles. There was formerly also a town of the samename, and another near it called Armene; we now find therethe colony of Sinope,<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> distant from Mount Cytorus one hundredand sixty-four miles. We then come to the river Evarchus,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span><pb n="2005" />and after that a people of the Cappadocians, the towns of Gaziura<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> and Gazelum,<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> the river Halys,<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> which runs from thefoot of Mount Taurus through Cataonia and Cappadocia, thetowns of Gangre<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> and Carusa,<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> the free town of Amisus,<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span>distant from Sinope one hundred and thirty miles, and a gulfof the same name, of such vast extent<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> as to make Asia assumethe form of a peninsula, the isthmus of which is only sometwo hundred<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> miles in breadth, or a little more, across to thegulf of Issus in Cilicia. In all this district there are, it issaid, only three races that can rightly be termed Greeks, theDorians, the Ionians, and the ®olians, all the rest being ofbarbarian origin.<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> To Amisus was joined the town of Eupatoria,<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span> founded by Mithridates: after his defeat they wereboth included under the name of Pompeiopolis.<pb n="2006" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Paphlagonia was bounded by Bithynia on the west, and by Pontus on the east, being separated from the last by the river Halys; on the south it was divided by the chain of Mount Olympus from Phrygia in the earlier times, from Galatia at a later period; and on the north it bordered on the Euxine.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In the Homeric catalogue we find Pyl¾menes leading the Paphlagonians as allies of the Trojans; from this Pyl¾menes the later princes ofPaphlagonia claimed their descent, and the country was sometimes fromthem called Pyl¾menia.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Suspected by Hardouin to have been the same as the Moson or Moston mentioned by Ptolemy as in Galatia.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is mentioned by Homer, Il. ii. 855, as situate on the coast of Paphlagonia.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Strabo also, in B. xii., says that these people afterwards established themselves in Thrace, and that gradually moving to the west, they finally settled in the Italian Venetia, which from them took its name. But in his Fourth Book he says that the Veneti of Italy owe their origin to the Gallic Veneti, who came from the neighbourhood known as the modernVannes.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This city, ninety stadia east of the river Parthenius, occupied a peninsula, and on each side of the isthmus was a harbour. The original city,as here mentioned, seems to have had the name of Sesamus or Sesamum,and it is spoken of by that name in Homer, Il. ii. 853, in conjunctionwith Cytorus. The territory of Amastris was famous for its growth of thebest box-wood, which grew on Mount Cytorus. The present Amasra orHanasserall occupies its site.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See the last Note.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Otherwise called "Cinolis." There is a place called Kinla or Kinoglu in the maps, about half-way between Kerempeh and Sinope, which is the Kinuli of Abulfeda, and probably the Cirolis or Cimolis of the Greek geographers.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The modern Estefan or Stefanos.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now known by the name of Bartin, a corruption of its ancient appellation.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It still retains its ancient appellation in its name of Cape Kerempeh: of the ancient town nothing is known.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called Sinope, or Sinoub. Some ruins of it are still to be seen. The modern town is but a poor place, and has probably greatly declined since the recent attack upon it by the Russian fleet. Diogenes, the Cynic philosopher, was a native of ancient Sinope.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The boundary, according to Stephanus Byzantinus, also of the nations of Paphlagonia and Cappadocia. As Parisot remarks, this is an error, arising from the circumstance of a small tribe bearing the name of Cappadocians, having settled on its banks, between whom and the Paphlagonians it served as a limit.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">On the river Iris. It was the ancient residence of the kings of Pontus, but in Strabo's time it was deserted. It has been suggested that the modern Azurnis occupies its site.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In the north-west of Pontus, in a fertile plain between the rivers Halys and Amisus. It is also called Gadilon by Strabo. D'Anville makes it the modern Aladgiam; while he calls Gaziura by the name of Guedes.</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called the Kisil Irmak, or Red River. It has been remarkedthat Pliny, in making this river to come down from Mount Taurus andflow at once from south to north, appears to confound the Halys with oneof its tributaries, now known as the Izchel Irmak.</p><p><span id="note_17"><a href="#ref_17">17. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Its site is now called Kiengareh, Kangreh, or Changeri. This was a town of Paphlagonia, to the south of Mount Olgasys, at a distance of thirty-five miles from Pompeiopolis.</p><p><span id="note_18"><a href="#ref_18">18. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A commercial place to the south of Sinope. Its site is the modern Gherseh on the coast.</p><p><span id="note_19"><a href="#ref_19">19. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called Eski Samsun; on the west side of the bay or gulf, anciently called Sinus Amisenus. According to Strabo, it was only 900 stadia from Sinope, or 112 1/2 Roman miles. The walls of the ancient city are to be seen on a promontory about a mile and a half from the modern town.</p><p><span id="note_20"><a href="#ref_20">20. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He means the numerous indentations which run southward into the coast, from the headland of Sinope to a distance of about one degree to the south.</p><p><span id="note_21"><a href="#ref_21">21. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">On examining the map, we shall find that the distance is at least 300 miles across to the gulf of Issus or Iskenderoon.</p><p><span id="note_22"><a href="#ref_22">22. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Not speaking the Greek language.</p><p><span id="note_23"><a href="#ref_23">23. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A part of it only was added to Eupatoria; and it was separated from the rest by a wall, and probably contained a different population from that of Amisus. This new quarter contained the residence of the king, Mithridates Eupator, who built Eupatoria.</p></body>
