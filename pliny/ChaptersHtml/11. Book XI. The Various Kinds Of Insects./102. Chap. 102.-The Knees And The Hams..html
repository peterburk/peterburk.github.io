Those quadrupeds which are oviparous, such as thecrocodile and the lizard, bend the knee of the fore-leg back-<pb n="3088" />wards, and that of the hind-leg forwards; their thighs areplaced on them obliquely, in a similar manner to a man'sthumb; which is the case also with the multipede insects, thehind-legs only excepted of such as leap. Birds, like quadru-peds, have the joints of the wings bending forwards, but thoseof the legs backwards.</p></div2></body>
