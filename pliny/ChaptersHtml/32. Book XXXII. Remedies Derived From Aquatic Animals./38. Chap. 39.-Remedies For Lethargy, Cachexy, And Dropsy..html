For cachectic patients, wherethe body is wasting with consumption, tethe¾<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> are consideredbeneficial, mixed with rue and honey. For the cure ofdropsy, dolphin's fat is melted and taken with wine, the repulsivetaste of it being neutralized by first touching thenostrils with unguent or some other odoriferous substance, orelse by plugging the nostrils in some way or other. The fleshof strombi, pounded and given in three hemin¾ of honiedwine and the same quantity of water, or, if there is fever,in hydromel, is very useful for dropsy: the same, too, withthe juice of river-crabs, administered with honey. Waterfrogs, too, are boiled with old wine and spelt,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and taken asfood, the liquor in which they have been boiled being drunkfrom the same vessel: or else the feet, head, and tail of atortoise are cut off, and the intestines removed, the rest ofthe flesh being seasoned in such a manner as to allow ofits being taken without loathing. River-crabs, too, eaten withtheir broth, are said to be very good for the cure of phthisis.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See Chapter 29 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See Chapters 30 and 31 of the present Book.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xviii. c. 19.</p></body>
