<div2 type="chapter" n="83" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 83. (58.)—PLACES IN WHICH CERTAIN ANIMALS ARE NOTTO BE FOUND.</head><p>It is a remarkable fact, that nature has not only assigneddifferent countries to different animals, but that even in thesame country, it has denied certain species to peculiar localities.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>In Italy the dormouse is found in one part only, the Messianforest.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> In Lycia the gazelle never passes beyond the mountains which border upon Syria;<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> nor does the wild ass in thatvicinity pass over those which divide Cappadocia from Cilicia.On the banks of the Hellespont, the stags never pass into astrange territory, and about Arginussa<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> they never go beyondMount Elaphus; those upon that mountain, too, have clovenears. In the island of Poroselene,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> the weasels will not somuch as cross a certain road. In Bœotia, the moles, which wereintroduced at Lebadea, fly from the very soil of that country,while in the neighbourhood, at Orchomenus, the very sameanimals tear up all the fields. We have seen coverlets forbeds made of the skins of these creatures, so that our sense ofreligion does not prevent us from employing these ominousanimals for the purposes of luxury. When hares have beenbrought to Ithaca, they die as soon as ever they touch theshore, and the same is the case with rabbits, on the shores ofthe island of Ebusus;<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> while they abound in the vicinity,<pb n="2353" />Spain namely, and the Balearic isles. In Cyrene, the frogswere formerly dumb, and this species still exists, althoughcroaking ones were carried over there from the continent.At the present day, even, the frogs in the island of Seriphosare dumb; but when they are carried to other places, theycroak; the same thing is also said to have taken place atSicandrus, a lake of Thessaly.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> In Italy, the bite of theshrew-mouse<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> is venomous; an animal which is not to be foundin any region beyond the Apennines. In whatever countryit exists, it always dies immediately if it goes across the rutmade by a wheel. Upon Olympus, a mountain of Macedonia, there are no wolves, nor yet in the isle of Crete.<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> Inthis island there are neither foxes, nor bears, nor, indeed, anykind of baneful animal,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> with the exception of the phalangium,a species of spider, of which I shall speak in its appropriateplace.<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> It is a thing still more remarkable, that in this islandthere are no stags, except in the district of Cydon;<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> the sameis the case with the wild boar, the woodcock,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> and the hedgehog. In Africa, there are neither wild boars, stags, deer, norbears.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle, Hist. Anim.
