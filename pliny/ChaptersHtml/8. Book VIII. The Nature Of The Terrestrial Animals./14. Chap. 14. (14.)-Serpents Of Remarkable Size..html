<div2 type="chapter" n="14" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 14. (14.)—SERPENTS OF REMARKABLE SIZE.</head><p>Megasthenes informs us, that in India, serpents grow tosuch an immense size, as to swallow stags and bulls;<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> whileMetrodorus says, that about the river Rhyndacus,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> in Pontus,they seize and swallow the birds that are flying above them,however high and however rapid their flight.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> It is a well-known fact, that during the Punic war, at the river Bagrada, a<pb n="2262" />serpent one hundred and twenty feet in length was taken by theRoman army under Regulus, being besieged, like a fortress, bymeans of balistæ and other engines of war.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> Its skin and jawswere preserved in a temple at Rome, down to the time of theNumantine war. The serpents which in Italy are known bythe name of boa, render these accounts far from incredible, forthey grow to such a vast size, that a child was found entirein the stomach of one of them, which was killed on the Vaticanian Hill during the reign of the Emperor Claudius.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> Theseare nourished, in the first instance, with the milk of the cow,and from this they take their name.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> As to the other animals,which have been of late repeatedly brought to Italy from allparts of the world, it is quite unnecessary to give any minuteaccount of their form.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is well known, that certain serpents have the jaws and fauces soconstructed, that they will allow of the passage of an animal more bulkythan themselves; they first crush its bones, and form it into a kind of pulp,and then pass it, without further change, into the stomach, where it isslowly dissolved by the gastric juices.—B.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Supposed to have been in Mysia, or Bithynia, considerably to the westof Pontus.—B.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This account is entirely without foundation. The same statement ismade by Ælian, Anim. Nat. B. ii. c. 21, who probably copied it from Metrodorus. There are stories of the power which serpents possess of fascinating birds by the eye, but they are not improbably without foundation.—B. There is little doubt, however, that some serpents have the power,by some means or other, of fascinating the birds which they make theirprey.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is referred to by many ancient writers; among others, by Livy,B. xviii.; Florus, B. ii. c. 2; Valerius Maximus, B. i. c. 8; and AulusGellius, B. vi. c. 3.—B.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">As Cuvier remarks, it is difficult to conceive what he means by theboa of Italy. At the present day, the longest Italian serpents are theÆsculapian serpent (a harmless animal), and the "Coluber quadrilineatus"of Linnæus, neither of which exceeds ten feet in length. The one herementioned, was probably, as Cuvier suggests, one of the genuine boa orpython species; but, as he says, where did it come from? and how did itget there?</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is doubtful whether any one ever witnessed a serpent sucking a cow,but it seems to have been generally believed, and it is therefore probable,that the name of the animal was derived from this circumstance.—B. Itis still believed of the common snake in some parts of this country. Thereading "primo" has been preferred to "trimo," that adopted by Sillig.</p></body>
