<div2 type="chapter" n="39" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 39.ÑREMEDIES FOR ULCEROUS SORES AND WOUNDS.</head><p>For the cure of ulcers, wool-grease is used, with ashes of<pb n="5459" />burnt barley and verdigrease, in equal quantities; a preparation which is good, too, for carcinomata and spreading sores.It cauterizes the flesh also around the margins of ulcers, andreduces and makes level fungous excrescences formed by sores.Ashes, too, of burnt sheep's dung, mixed with nitre, are of greatefficacy for the cure of carcinomata; as also those of lambs'thigh-bones, in cases more particularly where ulcers refuse tocicatrize. Very considerable, too, is the efficacy of lights,ram's lights in particular, which are of the greatest utility forreducing and making level the fleshy excrescences formed byulcerous sores. With sheep's dung, warmed beneath anearthen pan and kneaded, the swellings attendant upon woundsare reduced, and fistulous sores and epinyctis are cleansed andmade to heal.</p><p>But it is in the ashes of a burnt dog's head that thegreatest efficacy is found; as it quite equals spodium<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> inits property of cauterizing all kinds of fleshy excrescences,and causing sores to heal. Mouse-dung, too, is used as acautery, and weasels' dung, burnt to ashes. Pounded millepedes, mixed with turpentine and earth of Sinope,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> are usedfor penetrating carcinomata and fleshy indurations in deep-seated sores; and the same substances are remarkably usefulfor the treatment of ulcers threatened with maggots.</p><p>Indeed the several varieties of worms themselves are possessed of marvellously useful properties. The worms,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> forinstance, that breed in wood are curative of all kinds of ulcers:reduced to ashes, with an equal quantity of anise, and appliedwith oil, they heal cancerous sores. Earthworms are so remark-ably healing for wounds recently inflicted, that it is a verygeneral belief that by the end of seven days they will unitesinews even that have been cut as under: hence it is that it is re-commended to keep them preserved in honey. Ashes of burntearth-worms, in combination with tar or Simblian honey,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> cau-terize the indurated margins of ulcerous sores. Some persons dryearthworms in the sun, and apply them to wounds with vinegar,the application not being removed till the end of acouple of days.The earth also that adheres to snails is useful, similarly em-<pb n="5460" />ployed; snails, too, taken whole from the shell, are poundedand applied to fresh wounds, to heal them, and they arrest theprogress of cancerous sores.</p><p>There is an insect called "herpes"<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> by the Greeks, whichis particularly useful for the cure of all kinds of serpiginous<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>sores. Snails, beaten up, shells and all, are very good for thispurpose; and it is said that, with myrrh and frankincense,they will unite the sinews even when cut asunder. The fat,too, of a dragon,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> dried in the sun, is remarkably usefull, andso are the brains of a cock or capon for recent wounds. Bytaking with the food salt in which vipers have been preserved,ulcers are rendered more easy of treatment, it is said, and aremade to heal all the sooner. Antonius<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> the physician, afteroperating in vain upon ulcers, that were incurable with theknife, used to prescribe viper's flesh to be eaten by the patient,whereby a marvellously speedy cure was effected.</p><p>The locust called "troxallis,"<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> reduced to ashes and appliedwith honey, removes the indurated margins of ulcerous sores:ashes, also, of burnt pigeons' dung, with arsenic and honey,are very effectual in all cases where a cautery is required.The brains of a horned owl, applied with goose-grease, aremarvellously efficacious for uniting wounds, it is said. Forthe malignant ulcer known as "caco‘thes,"<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> the ashes of aram's thigh-bones are used, mixed with woman's milk, the soresbeing washed with linen cloths well rinsed. For the samepurpose, the bird known as the screech-owl<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> is boiled in oil,ewe-milk butter and honey being added to the preparation,when properly dissolved. An application of bees that havedied in the honey, acts emolliently upon the indurated marginsof ulcerous sores; and for the cure of elephantiasis, the bloodand ashes of a weasel are employed. Wounds and weals pro-duced by blows are effaced by an application of sheep-skinsfresh from the body.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxxiv. c. 34.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxxv. cc. 12, 13.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Cosses."</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Dioscorides speaks of this honey as the produce of Sicily.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The "creeper."
