<div2 type="chapter" n="47" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 47. (10.)—INSTANCES OF IMMENSE WEALTH. PERSONSWHO HAVE POSSESSED THE GREATEST SUMS OF MONEY.</head><p>The ancients had no number whereby to express a largersum than one hundred thousand; and hence it is that, atthe present day, we reckon by multiples of that number, as,for instance, ten times one hundred thousand, and so on.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> Forthese multiplications we are indebted to usury and the use ofcoined money; and hence, too, the expression "æs alienum,"or "another man's money," which we still use.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> In latertimes, again, the surname "Dives"<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> was given to some: onlybe it known to all, that the man who first received this surnamebecame a bankrupt and so bubbled his creditors.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> M.Crassus,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> a member of the same family, used to say that noman was rich, who could not maintain a legion upon his yearlyincome. He possessed in land two hundred millions<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> ofsesterces, being the richest Roman citizen next to Sylla. Norwas even this enough for him, but he must want to possess allthe gold of the Parthians too!<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> And yet, although he was thefirst to become memorable for his opulence—so pleasant is thetask of stigmatizing this insatiate cupidity—we have knownof many manumitted slaves, since his time, much morewealthy than he ever was; three for example, all at the same<pb n="6130" />time, in the reign of the Emperor Claudius, Pallas,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> Callistus,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>and Narcissus.<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span></p><p>But to omit all further mention of these men, as thoughthey were still<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> the rulers of the empire, let us turn to C.Cæcilius Claudius Isidorus, who, in the consulship of C.Asinius Gallus and C. Marcius Censorinus,<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> upon the sixthday before the calends of February, declared by his will, thatthough he had suffered great losses through the civil wars, hewas still able to leave behind him four thousand one hundredand sixteen slaves, three thousand six hundred pairs of oxen,and two hundred and fifty-seven thousand heads of other kindof cattle, besides, in ready money, sixty millions of sesterces.Upon his funeral, also, he ordered eleven hundred thousandsesterces to be expended.</p><p>And yet, supposing all these enormous riches to be addedtogether, how small a proportion will they bear to the wealthof Ptolemæus; the person who, according to Varro, whenPompeius was on his expedition in the countries adjoiningJudæa, entertained eight thousand horsemen at his own expense,and gave a repast to one thousand guests, setting beforeevery one of them a drinking-cup of gold, and changing thesevessels at every course! And then, again, how insignificantwould his wealth have been by the side of that of Pythiusthe Bithynian<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>—for I here make no mention of kings, be it<pb n="6131" />remarked. He it was who gave the celebrated plane-tree andvine of gold to King Darius, and who entertained at abanquet the troops of Xerxes, seven hundred and eighty-eightthousand men in all; with a promise of pay and cornfor the whole of them during the next five months, on conditionthat one at least of his five children, who had beendrawn for service, should be left to him as the solace of his oldage. And yet, let any one compare the wealth of Pythius tothat possessed by King Crœsus!</p><p>In the name of all that is unfortunate, what madness it isfor human nature to centre its desires upon a thing that haseither fallen to the lot of slaves, or else has reached no knownlimit in the aspirations even of kings!</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Twenty times one hundred thousand, &amp;c.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">As signifying a "debt owing to another."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"The Rich."</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This seems the best translation for "decoxisse creditoribus suis,"which literally means that he "boiled" or "melted away" his fortune fromhis creditors.

The first person mentioned in Roman history ashaving the cognomen "Dives," is P. Licinius Crassus, the personagementioned in B. xxi. c. 4.

He derived hiswealth from his gold mines in the neighbourhood of Celænæ in Phrygia,and would appear, in spite of Pliny's reservation, to have been little lessthan a king. His five sons accompanied Xerxes; but Pythius, alarmed byan eclipse of the sun, begged that the eldest might be left behind. Uponthis, Xerxes had the youth put to death, and his body cut in two, the armybeing ordered to march between the portions, which were placed on eitherside of the road. His other sons were all slain in battle, and Pythiuspassed the rest of his life in solitude.</p></body>
