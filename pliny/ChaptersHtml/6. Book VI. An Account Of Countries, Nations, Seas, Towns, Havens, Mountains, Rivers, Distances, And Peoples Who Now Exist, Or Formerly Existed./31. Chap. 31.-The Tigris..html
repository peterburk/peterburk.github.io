<div2 type="chapter" n="31" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 31.—THE TIGRIS.</head><p>There is, besides the above, another town in Mesopotamia,on the banks of the Tigris and near its confluence with theEuphrates, the name of which is Digba.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> (27.) But it will beas well now to give some particulars respecting the Tigrisitself. This river rises in the region of Greater Armenia,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>from a very remarkable source, situate on a plain. The nameof the spot is Elegosine,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and the stream, as soon as it beginsto flow, though with a slow current, has the name of Diglito.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>When its course becomes more rapid, it assumes the nameof Tigris,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> given to it on account of its swiftness, thatword signifying an arrow in the Median language. It thenflows into Lake Arethusa,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> the waters of which are able to<pb n="2076" />support all weighty substances thrown into them, and exhalenitrous vapours. This lake produces only one kind of fish,which, however, never enter the current of the river in itspassage through the lake: and in a similar manner, thefish of the Tigris will never swim out of its stream into thewaters of the lake. Distinguishable from the lake, both bythe rapidity and the colour of its waters, the tide of the river ishurried along; after it has passed through and arrived atMount Taurus, it disappears<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> in a cavern of that mountain,and passing beneath it, bursts forth on the other side;the spot bears the name of Zoroande.<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> That the waters oneither side of the mountain are the same, is evident from thefact, that bodies thrown in on the one side will reappear on theother. It then passes through another lake, called Thospites,and once more burying itself in the earth, reappears, afterrunning a distance of twenty-two miles, in the vicinity ofNymphæum.<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> Claudius Cæsar informs us that, in the districtof Arrene<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> it flows so near to the river Arsanias,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> that whentheir waters swell they meet and flow together, but without,however, intermingling. For those of the Arsani, as he says,being lighter, float on the surface of the Tigris for a distanceof nearly four miles, after which they separate, and the Arsanias flows into the Euphrates. The Tigris, after flowing throughArmenia and receiving the well-known rivers Parthenias andNicephorion, separates the Arabian Orei<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> from the Adiabeni,and then forms by its course, as previously mentioned, thecountry of Mesopotamia. After traversing the mountains ofthe Gordyæi,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> it passes round Apamea,<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> a town of Mesene, one<pb n="2077" />hundred and twenty-five miles on this side of Babylonian Seleucia, and then divides into two channels, one<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> of whichruns southward, and flowing through Mesene, runs towardsSeleucia, while the other takes a turn to the north and passesthrough the plains of the Cauchæ,<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> at the back of the district of Mesene. When the waters have reunited, the riverassumes the name of Pasitigris. After this, it receives theChoaspes,<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> which comes from Media; and then, as we havealready stated,<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> flowing between Seleucia and Ctesiphon, discharges itself into the Chaldæan Lakes, which it supplies for adistance of seventy miles. Escaping from them by a vastchannel, it passes the city of Charax to the right, and emptiesitself into the Persian Sea, being ten miles in width at themouth. Between the mouths of the two rivers Tigris and theEuphrates, the distance was formerly twenty-five, or, accordingto some writers, seven miles only, both of them being navigable to the sea. But the Orcheni and others who dwell onits banks, have long since dammed up the waters of theEuphrates for the purposes of irrigation, and it can only discharge itself into the sea by the aid of the Tigris.</p><p>The country on the banks of the Tigris is called Parapotamia;<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> we have already made mention of Mesene, one of itsdistricts. Dabithac<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> is a town there, adjoining to which is<pb n="2078" />the district of Chalonitis, with the city of Ctesiphon,<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> famous,not only for its palm-groves, but for its olives, fruits, and othershrubs. Mount Zagrus<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> reaches as far as this district, and extends from Armenia between the Medi and the Adiabeni,above Parætacene and Persis. Chalonitis<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span> is distant fromPersis three hundred and eighty miles; some writers saythat by the shortest route it is the same distance from Assyria and the Caspian Sea.</p><p>Between these peoples and Mesene is Sittacene, which isalso called Arbelitis<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span> and Palæstine. Its city of Sittace<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span> isof Greek origin; this and Sabdata<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span> lie to the east, and on thewest is Antiochia,<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span> between the two rivers Tigris and Tornadotus,<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span> as also Apamea,<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span> to which Antiochus<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span> gave this name,being that of his mother. The Tigris surrounds this city,which is also traversed by the waters of the Archoüs.<pb n="2079" /></p><p>Below<span id="ref_31"><a href="#note_31">[31]</a></span> this district is Susiane, in which is the city of Susa,<span id="ref_32"><a href="#note_32">[32]</a></span>the ancient residence of the kings of Persia, built by Darius,the son of Hystaspes; it is distant from Seleucia Babyloniafour hundred and fifty miles, and the same from Ecbatana ofthe Medi, by way of Mount Carbantus.<span id="ref_33"><a href="#note_33">[33]</a></span> Upon the northernchannel of the river Tigris is the town of Babytace,<span id="ref_34"><a href="#note_34">[34]</a></span> distantfrom Susa one hundred and thirty-five miles. Here, for theonly place in all the world, is gold held in abhorrence; thepeople collect it together and bury it in the earth, that it maybe of use to no one.<span id="ref_35"><a href="#note_35">[35]</a></span> On the east of Susiane are the Oxii, apredatory people, and forty independent savage tribes of theMizæi. Above these are the Mardi and the Saitæ, subject toParthia: they extend above the district of Elymais, which wehave already mentioned<span id="ref_36"><a href="#note_36">[36]</a></span> as joining up to the coast of Persis.Susa is distant two hundred and fifty miles from the PersianSea. Near the spot where the fleet of Alexander came up<span id="ref_37"><a href="#note_37">[37]</a></span> thePasitigris to Susa, there is a village situate on the ChaldæanLake, Aple by name, from which to Susa is a distance of sixtymiles and a half. Adjoining to the people of Susiane, on theeast, are the Cossiei;<span id="ref_38"><a href="#note_38">[38]</a></span> and above them, to the north, is Mesabatene, lying at the foot of Mount Cambalidus,<span id="ref_39"><a href="#note_39">[39]</a></span> a branch ofthe Caucasian chain: from this point the country of the Bactriis most accessible.</p><p>Susiane is separated from Elymais by the river Eulæus,which rises in Media, and, after concealing itself in theearth for a short distance, rises again and flows through Mesabatene. It then flows round the citadel of Susa<span id="ref_40"><a href="#note_40">[40]</a></span> and the<pb n="2080" />temple of Diana, which is held in the highest veneration byall these nations; the river itself being the object of manypompous ceremonials; the kings, indeed, will drink of noother water,<span id="ref_41"><a href="#note_41">[41]</a></span> and for that reason carry it with them on theirjournies to any considerable distance. This river receives thewaters of the Hedypnos,<span id="ref_42"><a href="#note_42">[42]</a></span> which passes Asylus, in Persis,and those of the Aduna, which rises in Susiane. Magoa<span id="ref_43"><a href="#note_43">[43]</a></span> isa town situate near it, and distant from Charax fifteen miles;some writers place this town at the very extremity of Susiane,and close to the deserts.</p><p>Below the Eulæus is Elymais,<span id="ref_44"><a href="#note_44">[44]</a></span> upon the coast adjoining toPersis, and extending from the river Orates<span id="ref_45"><a href="#note_45">[45]</a></span> to Charax, a distance of two hundred and forty miles. Its towns are Seleucia<span id="ref_46"><a href="#note_46">[46]</a></span>and Socrate,<span id="ref_47"><a href="#note_47">[47]</a></span> upon Mount Casyrus. The shore which lies infront of this district is, as we have already stated, rendered inaccessible by mud,<span id="ref_48"><a href="#note_48">[48]</a></span> the rivers Brixa and Ortacea bringingdown vast quantities of slime from the interior,—Elymaisitself being so marshy that it is impossible to reach Persisthat way, unless by going completely round: it is alsogreatly infested with serpents, which are brought down bythe waters of these rivers. That part of it which is the mostinaccessible of all, bears the name of Characene, fromCharax,<span id="ref_49"><a href="#note_49">[49]</a></span> the frontier city of the kingdoms of Arabia. Of<pb n="2081" />this place we will now make mention, after first stating theopinions of M. Agrippa in relation to this subject. Thatauthor informs us that Media, Parthia, and Persis, are boundedon the east by the Indus, on the west by the Tigris, on thenorth by Taurus and Caucasus, and on the south by the RedSea; that the length of these countries is thirteen hundred andtwenty miles, and the breadth eight hundred and forty; andthat, in addition to these, there is Mesopotamia, which, takenby itself, is bounded on the east by the Tigris, on the westby the Euphrates, on the north by the chain of Taurus, andon the south by the Persian Sea, being eight hundred miles inlength, and three hundred and sixty in breadth.</p><p>Charax is a city situate at the furthest extremity of theArabian Gulf, at which begins the more prominent portion ofArabia Felix:<span id="ref_50"><a href="#note_50">[50]</a></span> it is built on an artificial elevation, having theTigris on the right, and the Eulæus on the left, and lies ona piece of ground three miles in extent, just between the confluence of those streams. It was first founded by Alexanderthe Great, with colonists from the royal city of Durine, whichwas then destroyed, and such of his soldiers as were invalidedand left behind. By his order it was to be called Alexandria,and a borough called Pella, from his native place, was to bepeopled solely by Macedonians; the city, however, was destroyed by inundations of the rivers. Antiochus,<span id="ref_51"><a href="#note_51">[51]</a></span> the fifth kingof Syria, afterwards rebuilt this place and called it by hisown name; and on its being again destroyed, Pasines, the sonof Saggonadacus, and king of the neighbouring Arabians,whom Juba has incorrectly described as a satrap of king Antiochus, restored it, and raised embankments for its protection,calling it after himself. These embankments extended inlength a distance of nearly three miles, in breadth a little less.It stood at first at a distance of ten stadia from the shore, andeven had a harbour<span id="ref_52"><a href="#note_52">[52]</a></span> of its own. But according to Juba, it isfifty miles from the sea; and at the present day, the ambassadors from Arabia, and our own merchants who havevisited the place, say that it stands at a distance of one hundredand twenty miles from the sea-shore. Indeed, in no part of<pb n="2082" />the world have alluvial deposits been formed more rapidly bythe rivers, and to a greater extent than here; and it is onlya matter of surprise that the tides, which run to a considerabledistance beyond this city, do not carry them back again.At this place was born Dionysius,<span id="ref_53"><a href="#note_53">[53]</a></span> the most recent author ofa description of the world; he was sent by the late emperorAugustus to gather all necessary information in the East, whenhis eldest<span id="ref_54"><a href="#note_54">[54]</a></span> son was about to set out for Armenia to take thecommand against the Parthians and Arabians.</p><p>The fact has not escaped me, nor indeed have I forgotten,that at the beginning of this work<span id="ref_55"><a href="#note_55">[55]</a></span> I have remarked that eachauthor appeared to be most accurate in the description of his owncountry; still, while I am speaking of these parts of the world,I prefer to follow the discoveries made by the Roman arms, andthe description given by king Juba, in his work dedicated toCaius Cæsar above-mentioned, on the subject of the same expedition against Arabia.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Forbiger is of opinion that this is the same as the Didigua or Diduguaof Ptolemy.

The indistinctness of the ancientaccounts has caused it to be confused with the Eulæus, which flows nearlyparallel with it into the Tigris. It is pretty clear that they were notidentical. Pliny here states that they were different rivers, but makes themistake below, of saying that Susa was situate upon the Eulæus, instead ofthe Choaspes. These errors may be accounted for, it has been suggested,by the fact that there are two considerable rivers which unite at Bund-i-Kir, a little above Ahwaz, and form the ancient Pasitigris or modernKarun. It is supposed that the Karun represents the ancient Eulæus, andthe Kerkhah the Choaspes.</p><p><span id="note_18"><a href="#ref_18">18. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In c. 26 of the present Book.
