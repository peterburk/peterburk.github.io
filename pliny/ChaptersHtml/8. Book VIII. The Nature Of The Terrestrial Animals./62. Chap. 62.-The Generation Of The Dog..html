The young ones are born blind, and the greaterthe supply of nourishment from the mother's milk, the moreslowly do they acquire their sight; still, however, this nevertakes place later than the twentieth day, or earlier than theseventh. It is said by some writers, that if only one is born,it is able to see on the ninth day; and that if there are two,they begin to see on the tenth, every additional one causing thepower of seeing to come a day later. It is said, too, that thefemales which are produced by the mother in her first litter,are subject to the night-mare.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> The best dog of the litter isthe one which is last in obtaining its sight, or else the onewhich the mother carries first into her bed.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">These statements are probably, for the most part, from Aristotle,Hist.

Hardouin remarks on these words; "Flitting beforethe sight, and rushing upon each other, like the Ephialtes," and refers,for a farther explanation, to his commentary on the passage in B. xxv. c.10, where the subject is treated more at large. The Ephialtes is generallysupposed to have been what we term incubus or nightmare.—B.</p></body>
