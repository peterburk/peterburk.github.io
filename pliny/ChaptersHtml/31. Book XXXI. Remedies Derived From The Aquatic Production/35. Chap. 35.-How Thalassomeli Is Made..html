For this purpose, also, the water isbrought from out at sea, and the preparation is kept in anearthen vessel well pitched. It acts most efficiently as a purgative, and without in the least fatiguing the stomach; thetaste, too, and smell of it, are very agreeable.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Sea-water honey."</p></body>
