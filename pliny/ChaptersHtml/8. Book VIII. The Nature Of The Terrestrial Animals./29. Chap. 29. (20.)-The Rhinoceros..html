This too is another natural-born enemy of the elephant.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> It prepares itself for the combat by sharpening its horn against the rocks; and in fightingdirects it chiefly against the belly of its adversary, which itknows to be the softest part. The two animals are of equallength, but the legs of the rhinoceros are much the shorter:its skin is the colour of box-wood.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier says, that this was the single-horned rhinoceros of India.The commentators have been at a loss to reconcile this description withthe Epigram of Martial, Spect. Ep. xxii., where he speaks of the rhinoceros exhibited by Domitian, as having two horns. It has been provedthat this latter was of the two-horned species, by the medals of that emperor, now in existence. Martial, Spect. Ep. ix., seems also to have beenacquainted with the single-horned species. That with two horns is mentioned by Pausanias as the ®thiopian bull. We learn from modern naturalists, that the two-horned species is a native of the southern parts ofAfrica, while that with one horn is from Asia.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The other enemy is the dragon, as described in c. 11 and 12 of thepresent Book.ÑB.</p></body>
