<div2 type="chapter" n="1" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 1. (1.)â€”THE BOUNDARIES AND GULFS OF EUROPE FIRST SET FORTH IN A GENERAL WAY.</head><p>I shall first then speak of Europe, the foster-mother of thatpeople which has conquered all other nations, and itself byfar the most beauteous portion of the earth. Indeed, manypersons have, not without reason<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>, considered it, not as athird part only of the earth, but as equal to all the rest,looking upon the whole of our globe as divided into twoparts only, by a line drawn from the river Tanais to theStraits of Gades. The ocean, after pouring the waters of theAtlantic through the inlet which I have here described, and,in its eager progress, overwhelming all the lands which havehad to dread its approach, skirts with its winding course theshores of those parts which offer a more effectual resistance,hollowing out the coast of Europe especially into numerousbays, among which there are four Gulfs that are more particularly remarkable. The first of these begins at Calpe, whichI have previously mentioned, the most distant mountain ofSpain; and bends, describing an immense curve, as far asLocri and the Promontory of Bruttium<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This was the opinion of Herodotus, but it had been so strenuouslycombated by Polybius and other writers before the time of Pliny, that itis difficult to imagine how he should countenance it.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He probably alludes to Leucopetra, now called Capo dell' Armi.Locri Epizephyrii was a town of Bruttium, situate north of the promontory of Zephyrium, now called Capo di Bruzzano.</p></body>
