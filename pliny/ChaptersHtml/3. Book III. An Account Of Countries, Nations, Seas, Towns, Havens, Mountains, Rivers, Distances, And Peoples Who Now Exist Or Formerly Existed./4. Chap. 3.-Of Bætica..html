<div2 type="chapter" n="3" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 3.—OF BÆTICA.</head><p>Bætica, so called from the river which divides it in themiddle, excels all the other provinces in the richness of itscultivation and the peculiar fertility and beauty of its vegetation.</p><p>It consists of four jurisdictions, those of Gades<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>, of Corduba<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>, of Astigi<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>, and of Hispali<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>. The total number ofits towns is 175; of these nine are colonies<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>, and eight muni-<pb n="1155" />cipal towns<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>; twenty-nine have been long since presented withthe old Latin rights<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>; six are free towns<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>, three federate<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>,and 120 tributary.</p><p>In this district, the things that more especially deserve notice, or are more easily explained in the Latin tongue, are thefollowing, beginning at the river Ana, along the line of the seashore; the town of Onoba, surnamed Æstuaria<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>; the riversLuxia and Urium<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>, flowing through this territory betweenthe Ana and the Bætis; the Marian<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> Mountains; the riverBætis; the coast of Corum<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>, with its winding bay; opposite<pb n="1156" />to which is Gades, of which we shall have occasion to speakamong the islands<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>. Next comes the Promontory of Juno<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>,and the port of Bæsippo<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span>; the towns of Bœlo<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> and Mellaria<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span>,at which latter begin the Straits of the Atlantic; Carteia<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span>,called by the Greeks Tartessos<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span>; and the mountain of Calpe.</p><p>Along the coast of the inland sea<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> is the town of Barbesula<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span>with its river; also Salduba<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span>; the town of Suel<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span>; and thenMalaca<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span>, with its river, one of the federate towns. Next to thiscomes Mænoba<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span>, with its river; then Sexifirmum<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span>, surnamed<pb n="1157" />Julium; Selambina<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span>; Abdera<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span>; and Murci<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span>, which is at theboundary of Bætica. M. Agrippa supposed that all thiscoast was peopled by colonists of Punic origin. Beyond theAnas, and facing the Atlantic, is the country of the Bastuli<span id="ref_31"><a href="#note_31">[31]</a></span>and the Turditani. M. Varro informs us, that the Iberians,the Persians, the Phœnicians, the Celts, and the Carthaginians spread themselves over the whole of Spain; that thename "Lusitania" is derived from the games (<hi rend="ital">lusus</hi>) ofFather Bacchus, or the fury (<hi rend="ital">lyssa</hi><span id="ref_32"><a href="#note_32">[32]</a></span>) of his frantic attendants,and that Pan<span id="ref_33"><a href="#note_33">[33]</a></span> was the governor of the whole of it. But thetraditions respecting Hercules<span id="ref_34"><a href="#note_34">[34]</a></span> and Pyrene, as well as Saturn,I conceive to be fabulous in the highest degree.</p><p>The Bætis does not rise, as some writers have asserted,near the town of Mentisa<span id="ref_35"><a href="#note_35">[35]</a></span>, in the province of Tarraco, butin the Tugiensian Forest<span id="ref_36"><a href="#note_36">[36]</a></span>; and near it rises the river Tader<span id="ref_37"><a href="#note_37">[37]</a></span>,which waters the territory of Carthage<span id="ref_38"><a href="#note_38">[38]</a></span>. At Ilorcum<span id="ref_39"><a href="#note_39">[39]</a></span> it<pb n="1158" />turns away from the Funeral Pile<span id="ref_40"><a href="#note_40">[40]</a></span> of Scipio; then taking asweep to the left, it falls into the Atlantic Ocean, giving itsname to this province: at its source it is but small, thoughduring its course it receives many other streams, which it deprives as well of their waters as their renown. It first entersBætica in Ossigita-nia<span id="ref_41"><a href="#note_41">[41]</a></span>, and glides gently, with a smoothcurrent, past many towns situate on either side of its banks.</p><p>Between this river and the sea-shore the most celebratedplaces inland are Segida<span id="ref_42"><a href="#note_42">[42]</a></span>, also surnamed Augurina; Julia<span id="ref_43"><a href="#note_43">[43]</a></span>,called Fidentia; Urgao<span id="ref_44"><a href="#note_44">[44]</a></span> or Alba, Ebora<span id="ref_45"><a href="#note_45">[45]</a></span> or Cerealis, Iliberri<span id="ref_46"><a href="#note_46">[46]</a></span> or Liberini, Ilipula<span id="ref_47"><a href="#note_47">[47]</a></span> or Laus, Artigi<span id="ref_48"><a href="#note_48">[48]</a></span> or Julienses,Vesci<span id="ref_49"><a href="#note_49">[49]</a></span> or Faventia, Singili<span id="ref_50"><a href="#note_50">[50]</a></span>, Attegua<span id="ref_51"><a href="#note_51">[51]</a></span>, Arialdunum, AglaMinor<span id="ref_52"><a href="#note_52">[52]</a></span>, Bæbro<span id="ref_53"><a href="#note_53">[53]</a></span>, Castra Vinaria<span id="ref_54"><a href="#note_54">[54]</a></span>, Cisimbrium<span id="ref_55"><a href="#note_55">[55]</a></span>, Hippo<pb n="1159" />Nova or New Hippo<span id="ref_56"><a href="#note_56">[56]</a></span>, Ilurco<span id="ref_57"><a href="#note_57">[57]</a></span>, Osca<span id="ref_58"><a href="#note_58">[58]</a></span>, Escua<span id="ref_59"><a href="#note_59">[59]</a></span>, Sucubo<span id="ref_60"><a href="#note_60">[60]</a></span>, Nuditanum, Old Tuati<span id="ref_61"><a href="#note_61">[61]</a></span>; all which towns are in that part of Bastitania which extends towards the sea, but in the jurisdiction<span id="ref_62"><a href="#note_62">[62]</a></span> ofCorduba. In the neighbourhood of the river itself is Ossigi<span id="ref_63"><a href="#note_63">[63]</a></span>,also surnamed Laconicum, Iliturgi<span id="ref_64"><a href="#note_64">[64]</a></span> or Forum Julium, Ipasturgi<span id="ref_65"><a href="#note_65">[65]</a></span> or Triumphale, Setia, and, fourteen miles inland,Obulco<span id="ref_66"><a href="#note_66">[66]</a></span>, which is also called Pontificense.</p><p>Next to these comes Epora<span id="ref_67"><a href="#note_67">[67]</a></span>, a federate town, Sacili<span id="ref_68"><a href="#note_68">[68]</a></span>Martialium, and Onoba<span id="ref_69"><a href="#note_69">[69]</a></span>. On the right bank is Corduba,a Roman colony, surnamed Patricia<span id="ref_70"><a href="#note_70">[70]</a></span>; here the Bætis firstbecomes navigable. There are also the towns of Carbula<pb n="1160" />and Detunda<span id="ref_71"><a href="#note_71">[71]</a></span>, and the river Singulis<span id="ref_72"><a href="#note_72">[72]</a></span>, which falls into theBætis on the same side.</p><p>The towns in the jurisdiction of Hispalis are the following:Celti, Arua<span id="ref_73"><a href="#note_73">[73]</a></span>, Canama<span id="ref_74"><a href="#note_74">[74]</a></span>, Evia, Ilipa<span id="ref_75"><a href="#note_75">[75]</a></span>, surnamed Illa, and Italica<span id="ref_76"><a href="#note_76">[76]</a></span>. On the left of the river is the colony of Hispalis<span id="ref_77"><a href="#note_77">[77]</a></span> namedRomuliensis, and, on the opposite side<span id="ref_78"><a href="#note_78">[78]</a></span>, the town of Osset<span id="ref_79"><a href="#note_79">[79]</a></span>,surnamed Julia Constantia, Vergentum, or Juli Genius<span id="ref_80"><a href="#note_80">[80]</a></span>,Orippo, Caura<span id="ref_81"><a href="#note_81">[81]</a></span>, Siarum, and the river Menoba<span id="ref_82"><a href="#note_82">[82]</a></span>, whichenters the Bætis on its right bank. Between the æstuariesof the Bætis lie the towns of Nebrissa<span id="ref_83"><a href="#note_83">[83]</a></span>, surnamed Veneria,and of Colobona<span id="ref_84"><a href="#note_84">[84]</a></span>. The colonies are, Asta<span id="ref_85"><a href="#note_85">[85]</a></span>, which is alsocalled Regia, and, more inland, that of Asido<span id="ref_86"><a href="#note_86">[86]</a></span>, surnamedCæsariana.</p><p>The river Singulis, discharging itself into the Bætis at theplace already mentioned, washes the colony of Astigi<span id="ref_87"><a href="#note_87">[87]</a></span>, sur-<pb n="1161" />named Augusta Firma, at which place it becomes navigable.The other colonies in this jurisdiction which are exempt fromtribute are Tucci, surnamed Augusta Gemella<span id="ref_88"><a href="#note_88">[88]</a></span>, Itucci calledVirtus Julia<span id="ref_89"><a href="#note_89">[89]</a></span>, Attubi or Claritas Julia<span id="ref_90"><a href="#note_90">[90]</a></span>, Urso<span id="ref_91"><a href="#note_91">[91]</a></span> or Genua Urbanorum; and among them in former times Munda<span id="ref_92"><a href="#note_92">[92]</a></span>, which wastaken with the son of Pompey. The free towns are Old Astigi<span id="ref_93"><a href="#note_93">[93]</a></span> and Ostippo<span id="ref_94"><a href="#note_94">[94]</a></span>; the tributary towns are Callet, Callecula,Castra Gemina, the Lesser Ilipula, Merucra, Sacrana, Obulcula<span id="ref_95"><a href="#note_95">[95]</a></span>, and Oningis. As you move away from the sea-coast,near where the river Menoba is navigable, you find, at nogreat distance, the Alontigiceli and the Alostigi<span id="ref_96"><a href="#note_96">[96]</a></span>.</p><p>The country which extends from the Bætis to the riverAnas, beyond the districts already described, is called Bæturia, and is divided into two parts and the same number ofnations; the Celtici<span id="ref_97"><a href="#note_97">[97]</a></span>, who border upon Lusitania, in the ju-<pb n="1162" />risdiction of Hispalis, and the Turduli, who dwell on theverge<span id="ref_98"><a href="#note_98">[98]</a></span> of Lusitania and Tarraconensis, and are under theprotection of the laws of Corduba. It is evident that theCeltici have sprung from the Celtiberi, and have come fromLusitania, from their religious rites, their language, and thenames of their towns, which in Bætica are distinguished bythe following epithets<span id="ref_99"><a href="#note_99">[99]</a></span>, which have been given to them.Seria has received the surname of Fama Julia<span id="ref_100"><a href="#note_100">[100]</a></span>, Nertobriga that of Concordia Julia<span id="ref_101"><a href="#note_101">[101]</a></span>, Segida that of RestitutaJulia<span id="ref_102"><a href="#note_102">[102]</a></span>, and Contributa<span id="ref_103"><a href="#note_103">[103]</a></span> that of Julia. What is now Curigawas formerly Ucultuniacum, Constantia Julia<span id="ref_104"><a href="#note_104">[104]</a></span> was Laconimurgis, the present Fortunales were the Tereses<span id="ref_105"><a href="#note_105">[105]</a></span>, and theEmanici were the Callenses<span id="ref_106"><a href="#note_106">[106]</a></span>. Besides these, there are inCeltica the towns of Acinippo<span id="ref_107"><a href="#note_107">[107]</a></span>, Arunda<span id="ref_108"><a href="#note_108">[108]</a></span>, Aruci<span id="ref_109"><a href="#note_109">[109]</a></span>, Turobriga, Lastigi, Salpesa, Sæpone, and Serippo.</p><p>The other Bæturia, which we have mentioned, is inhabitedby the Turduli, and, in the jurisdiction of Corduba, has sometowns which are by no means inconsiderable; Arsa<span id="ref_110"><a href="#note_110">[110]</a></span>,<pb n="1163" />Mellaria<span id="ref_111"><a href="#note_111">[111]</a></span>, Mirobriga<span id="ref_112"><a href="#note_112">[112]</a></span>, and Sisapo<span id="ref_113"><a href="#note_113">[113]</a></span>, in the district ofOsintias.</p><p>To the jurisdiction of Gades belongs Regina, with Romancitizens; and Læpia, Ulia<span id="ref_114"><a href="#note_114">[114]</a></span>, Carisa<span id="ref_115"><a href="#note_115">[115]</a></span> surnamed Aurelia, Urgia<span id="ref_116"><a href="#note_116">[116]</a></span>or Castrum Julium, likewise called Cæsaris Salutariensis,all of which enjoy the Latian rights. The tributary townsare Besaro, Belippo<span id="ref_117"><a href="#note_117">[117]</a></span>, Barbesula, Lacippo, Bæsippo, Callet,Cappacum, Oleastro, Ituci, Brana, Lacibi, Saguntia<span id="ref_118"><a href="#note_118">[118]</a></span>, andAudorisæ.</p><p>M. Agrippa has also stated the whole length of this province to be 475 miles<span id="ref_119"><a href="#note_119">[119]</a></span>, and its breadth 257; but this was ata time when its boundaries extended to Carthage<span id="ref_120"><a href="#note_120">[120]</a></span>, a circumstance which has often caused great errors in calculations;which are generally the result either of changes effected in thelimits of provinces, or of the fact that in the reckoning of distances the length of the miles has been arbitrarily increased ordiminished. In some parts too the sea has been long makingencroachments upon the land, and in others again the shoreshave advanced; while the course of rivers in this place hasbecome more serpentine, in that more direct. And then,besides, some writers begin their measurements at one place,<pb n="1164" />and some at another, and so proceed in different directions;and hence the result is, that no two accounts agree.</p><p>(2.) At the present day the length of Bætica, from thetown of Castulo<span id="ref_121"><a href="#note_121">[121]</a></span>, on its frontier, to Gades is 250 miles, andfrom Murci, which lies on the sea-coast, twenty-five milesmore. The breadth, measured from the coast of Carteia, is234 miles. Who is there that can entertain the belief thatAgrippa, a man of such extraordinary diligence, and one whobestowed so much care on his subject, when he proposed toplace before the eyes of the world a survey of that world, couldbe guilty of such a mistake as this, and that too when secondedby the late emperor the divine Augustus ? For it was thatemperor who completed the Portico<span id="ref_122"><a href="#note_122">[122]</a></span> which had been begunby his sister, and in which the survey was to be kept, in conformity with the plan and descriptions of M. Agrippa.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The present Cadiz.
