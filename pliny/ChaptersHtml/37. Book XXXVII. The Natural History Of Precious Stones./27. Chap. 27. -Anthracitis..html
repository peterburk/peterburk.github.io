Some of these stones, they say, are surroundedwith a vein of white. Like those which we havementioned above, they have a fiery colour, but there is thispeculiarity in them, that when thrown into the fire they have allthe appearance of becoming quenched and deadened; while, onthe other hand, if they are drenched with water, they becomedoubly glowing.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. iv. c. 1.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Carbo." This word may mean either a "burning coal" or" charcoal,"hence the confusion that has arisen in identifying the mineralsubstance that is meant.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See Note 90, to Chapter 25.</p></body>
