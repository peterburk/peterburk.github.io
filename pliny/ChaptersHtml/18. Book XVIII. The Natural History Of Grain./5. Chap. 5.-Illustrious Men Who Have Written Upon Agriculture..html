For among those who<pb n="4010" />have written on this subject we find the names of kings even,Hiero, for instance, Attalus Philometor, and Archelaüs, as well asof generals, Xenophon, for example, and Mago the Carthaginian.Indeed, to this last writer did the Roman senate award suchhigh honours, that, after the capture of Carthage, when itbestowed the libraries of that city upon the petty kings ofAfrica, it gave orders, in his case only, that his thirty-twoBooks should be translated into the Latin language, and this,although M. Cato had already compiled his Book of Precepts;it took every care also to entrust the execution of this task tomen who were well versed in the Carthaginian tongue, amongwhom was pre-eminent D. Silanus, a member of one of themost illustrious families of Rome. I have already indicated,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>at the commencement of this work, the numerous learnedauthors and writers in verse, together with other illustriousmen, whose authority it is any intention to follow; but amongthe number I may here more particularly distinguish M. Yarro,who, at the advanced age of eighty-eight years, thought ithis duty to publish a treatise upon this subject.</p><p>(4.) Among the Romans the cultivation of the vine wasintroduced at a comparatively recent period, and at first, asindeed they were obliged to do, they paid their sole attentionto the culture of the fields. The various methods of cultivating the land will now be our subject; and they shall be treatedof by us in no ordinary or superficial manner, but in the samespirit in which we have hitherto written; enquiry shall bemade with every care first into the usages of ancient days, andthen into the discoveries of more recent times, our attentionbeing devoted alike to the primary causes of these operations,and the reasons upon which they are respectively based. Weshall make mention,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> too, of the various constellations, and ofthe several indications which, beyond all doubt, they afford tothe earth; and the more so, from the fact that those writerswho have hitherto treated of them with any degree of exact-ness, seem to have written their works for the use of any classof men but the agriculturist.<pb n="4011" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In the First Book, as originally written.
