"Ficedula" is the name by which it is called in autumn, but notafter that period; for then it is called "melancoryphus."<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> Inthe same manner, too, the erithacus<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> of the winter is the"phœnicurus" of the summer. The hoopoe also, accordingto the poet Æschylus, changes its form; it is a bird that feedsupon filth<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> of all kinds, and is remarkable for its twisted topknot, which it can contract or elevate at pleasure along the topof the head.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier supposes that this is one of the fly-catchers; the "Muscicapaatricapilla" of Linnæus, which changes in appearance entirely after thebreeding season.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The "black-head."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier thinks that this is the wall nightingale, the Motacilla phœnicurus of Linnæus, which is not seen in winter. On the other hand, theMotacilla rubecula of Linnæus, or red-throat, is only seen during thewinter, and being like the other bird, may have been taken for it, andnamed "phœnicurus."</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is not the case. Aristotle only says that it builds its nest ofhuman ordure; a story probably without any foundation, but still prevalentamong the French peasantry.</p></body>
