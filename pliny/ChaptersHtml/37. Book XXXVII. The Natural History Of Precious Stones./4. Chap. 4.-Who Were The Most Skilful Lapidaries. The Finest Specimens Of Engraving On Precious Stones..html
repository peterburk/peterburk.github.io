<div2 type="chapter" n="4" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 4.ÑWHO WERE THE MOST SKILFUL LAPIDARIES. THEFINEST SPECIMENS OF ENGRAVING ON PRECIOUS STONES.</head><p>The stone of the ring<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> which is now shown as that of Polycrates,is untouched and without engraving. In the time ofIsmenias, long<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> after his day, it would appear to have becomethe practice to engrave smaragdi even; a fact which is establishedby an edict of Alexander the Great, forbidding his portraitto be cut upon this stone by any other engraver thanPyrgoteles,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> who, no doubt, was the most famous adept in thisart. Since his time, Apollonides and Cronius have excelled init; as also Dioscurides,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> who engraved a very excellent likenessof the late Emperor Augustus upon a signet, which, ever since,the Roman emperors have used. The Dictator Sylla, it issaid, always made use of a seal<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> which represented the surrenderof Jugurtha. Authors inform us also, that the nativeof Intercatia,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> whose father challenged Scipio ®milianus,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>and was slain by him, was in the habit of using a signetwith a representation of this combat engraved upon it; a circumstancewhich gave rise to the well-known joke of StiloPr¾coninus,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> who naively enquired, what he would have doneif Scipio had been the person slain?</p><p>The late Emperor Augustus was in the habit, at first, ofusing the figure of a Sphinx<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> for his signet; having foundtwo of them, among the jewels of his mother, that were perfectlyalike. During the Civil Wars, his friends used to employone of these signets, in his absence, for sealing such lettersand edicts as the circumstances of the times required to beissued in his name; it being far from an unmeaning pleasantry<pb n="6390" />on the part of those who received these missives, that theSphinx always brought its enigmas<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> with it. The frog, too,on the seal of M¾cenas, was held in great terror, by reason ofthe monetary imposts which it announced. At a later period,with the view of avoiding the sarcasms relative to the Sphinx,Augustus made use of a signet with a figure upon it of Alexanderthe Great.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is said with reference to the one in the Temple of Concord,mentioned in Chapter 2.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">But see Exodus xxvii. 9, <hi rend="ital">et. seq.,</hi> where it is shown that the practiceexisted many hundreds of years before.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. vii. c. 38; where marble is the substance named.
