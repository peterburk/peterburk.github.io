<div2 type="chapter" n="48" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 48.—OCIMUM; THIRTY-FIVE REMEDIES.</head><p>Chrysippus has exclaimed as strongly, too, against ocimum<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>as he has against parsley, declaring that it is prejudicial to thestomach and the free discharge of the urine, and is injuriousto the sight; that it produces insanity, too, and lethargy, aswell as diseases of the liver; and that it is for this reason thatgoats refuse to touch it. Hence he comes to the conclusion,that the use of it ought to be avoided by man. Some personsgo so far as to say, that if beaten up, and then placed beneatha stone, a scorpion will breed there;<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and that if chewed, andthen placed in the sun, worms will breed in it. The people ofAfrica maintain, too, that if a person is stung by a scorpionthe same day on which he has eaten ocimum, his life cannotpossibly be saved. Even more than this, there are some whoassert, that if a handful of ocimum is beaten up with ten seaor river crabs, all the scorpions in the vicinity will be attractedto it. Diodotus, too, in his Book of Recipes,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> says, thatocimum, used as an article of food, breeds lice.</p><p>Succeeding ages, again, have warmly defended this plant; ithas been maintained, for instance, that goats do eat it, thatthe mind of no one who has eaten of it is at all affected, and,that mixed with wine, with the addition of a little vinegar, it isa cure for the stings of land scorpions, and the venom of thosefound in the sea. Experience has proved, too, that the smellof this plant in vinegar is good for fainting fits and lethargy,<pb n="4250" />as well as inflammations; that employed as a cooling liniment, with rose oil, myrtle oil, or vinegar, it is good for headache; and that applied topically with wine, it is beneficial fordefluxions of the eyes. It has been found also, that it is goodfor the stomach; that taken with vinegar, it dispels flatulenteructations; that applications of it arrest fluxes of the bowels;that it acts as a diuretic, and that in this way it is good forjaundice and dropsy, as well as cholera and looseness of thebowels.</p><p>Hence it is that Philistio has prescribed it even for cœliacaffections, and boiled, for dysentery. Some persons, too,though contrary to the opinion of Plistonicus, have given itin wine for tenesmus and spitting of blood, as also for obstructions of the viscera. It is employed, too, as a linimentfor the mamillæ, and has the effect of arresting the secretionof the milk. It is very good also for the ears of infants, whenapplied with goose-grease more particularly. The seed of it,beaten up, and inhaled into the nostrils, is provocative ofsneezing, and applied as a liniment to the head, of runningat the nostrils: taken in the food, too, with vinegar, it purgesthe uterus. Mixed with copperas<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> it removes warts. It acts,also, as an aphrodisiac, for which reason it is given to horsesand asses at the season for covering.</p><p>(13.) Wild ocimum has exactly the same properties in everyrespect, though in a more active degree. It is particularlygood, too, for the various affections produced by excessive vo-miting, and for abscesses of the womb. The root, mixed withwine, is extremely efficacious for bites inflicted by wildbeasts.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Ocimum basilicum of Linnæus, according to most commentators:though Fée is not of that opinion, it being originally from India, and neverfound in a wild state. From what Varro says, De Re Rust. B. i. c. 31,he thinks that it must be sought among the leguminous plants, the genusHedysarum, Lathyrus, or Medicago. He remarks also, that Pliny is themore to be censured for the absurdities contained in this Chapter, as thepreceding writers had only mentioned them to ridicule them.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. ix. c. 51.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"In Empericis."</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Atramento sutorio."</p></body>
