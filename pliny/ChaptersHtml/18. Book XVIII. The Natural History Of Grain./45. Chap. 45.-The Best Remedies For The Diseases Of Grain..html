<div2 type="chapter" n="45" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 45.—THE BEST REMEDIES FOR THE DISEASES OF GRAIN.</head><p>The best remedy for these maladies, so long as grain is inthe blade, is the weeding-hook, and, at the moment of sowing,ashes.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> As to those diseases which develop themselves in theseed and about the root, with due care precautions may be effectually employed against them. It is generally supposed thatif seed has been first steeped in wine,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> it will be less exposedto disease. Virgil<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> recommends that beans should be drenchedwith nitre and amurca of olives; and he says that if this isdone, they will be all the larger. Some persons, again, are ofopinion, that they will grow of increased size, if the seed issteeped for three days before it is sown in a solution of urineand water. If the ground, too, is hoed three times, a modiusof beans in the pod, they say, will yield not less than a modius<pb n="4058" />of shelled<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> beans. Other seeds, again, it is said, will beexempt from the attacks of maggots, if bruised cypress<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> leavesare mixed with them, or if they are sown just at the moon'sconjunction. Many persons, for the more effectual protectionof millet, recommend that a bramble-frog should be carried atnight round the field before the hoeing is done, and then buriedin an earthen vessel in the middle of it. If this is done, theysay, neither sparrows nor worms will attack the crop. Thefrog, however, must be disinterred before the millet is cut; forif this is neglected, the produce will be bitter. It is pretended,too, that all seeds which have been touched by the shouldersof a mole are remarkably productive.</p><p>Democritus recommends that all seeds before they are sownshould be steeped in the juice of the herb known as "aizoüm,"<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>which grows on tiles or shingles, and is known to us by theLatin name of "sedum" or "digitellum."<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> If blight pre-vails, or if worms are found adhering to the roots, it is a verycommon remedy to sprinkle the plants with pure amurca ofolives without salt, and then to hoe the ground. If, however,the crop should be beginning to joint, it should be stubbed atonce, for fear lest the weeds should gain the upper hand. Iknow for certain<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> that flights of starlings and sparrows, thosepests to millet and panic, are effectually driven away by meansof a certain herb, the name of which is unknown to me, beingburied at the four corners of the field: it is a wonderful thingto relate, but in such case not a single bird will enter it. Miceare kept away by the ashes of a weasel or a cat being steepedin water and then thrown upon the seed, or else by using thewater in which the body of a weasel or a cat has been boiled.The odour, however, of these animals makes itself perceivedin the bread even; for which reason it is generally thought abetter plan to steep the seed in ox-gall.<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> As for mildew,that greatest curse of all to corn, if branches of laurel are<pb n="4059" />fixed in the ground, it will pass away from the field into theleaves of the laurel. Over-luxuriance in corn is repressed bythe teeth of cattle,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> but only while it is in the blade; in whichcase, if depastured upon ever so often, no injury to it whenin the ear will be the result. If the ear, too, is once cut off,the grain, it is well known, will assume a larger<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> form, butwill be hollow within and worthless, and if sown, will cometo nothing.</p><p>At Babylon, however, they cut the blade twice, and thenlet the cattle pasture on it a third time, for otherwise it wouldrun to nothing but leaf. Even then, however, so fertile is thesoil, that it yields fifty, and, indeed, with care, as much as ahundred, fold. Nor is the cultivation of it attended with anydifficulty, the only object being to let the ground be underwater as long as possible, in order that the extreme richnessand exuberance of the soil may be modified. The Euphrates,however, and the Tigris do not deposit a slime, in the sameway that the Niles does in Egypt, nor does the soil producevegetation spontaneously; but still, so great is the fertility,that, although the seed is only trodden in with the foot, a cropsprings up spontaneously the following year. So great a dif-ferrous in soils as this, reminds me that I ought to take thisopportunity of specifying those which are the best adaptedfor the various kinds of grain.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This will only prevent the young plants from becoming a prey tosnails and slugs.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This plan is attended with no good results.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Georg. i. 193.
