(1.)â€”INTRODUCTION.</head><p>We have now set forth the various properties, medicinal orotherwise, as well of the cereals as of the other productionswhich lie upon<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> the surface of the earth, for the purpose eitherof serving us for food, or for the gratification of our senseswith their flowers or perfumes. In the trees, however,Pomona has entered the lists with them, and has impartedcertain medicinal properties to the fruits as they hang. Not content with protecting and nourishing, under the shadow of thetrees, the various plants which we have<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> already described,she would even appear to be indignant, as it were, at thethought that we should derive more succour from those productions which are further removed from the canopy of heaven,and which have only come into use in times comparatively recent. For she bids man bear in mind that it was the fruits ofthe trees which formed his first nourishment, and that it wasthese which first led him to look upwards towards the heavens:and not only this, but she reminds him, too, that even still itis quite possible for him to derive his aliment from the trees,without being indebted to grain for his subsistence.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In contradistinction to the fruits which hang from trees.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xvii. c. 18.</p></body>
