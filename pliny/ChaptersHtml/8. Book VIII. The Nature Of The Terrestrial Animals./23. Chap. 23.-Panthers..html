The lions of Syria alone are black.The spots of the panther are like small eyes, upon a whiteground. It is said that all quadrupeds are attracted in a mostwonderful manner by their odour,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> while they are terrifiedby the fierceness of their aspect; for which reason the creatureconceals its head, and then seizes upon the animals that areattracted to it by the sweetness of the odour. It is said bysome, that the panther has, on the shoulder, a spot which bearsthe form of the moon; and that, like it, it regularly increasesto full, and then diminishes to a crescent. At present, weapply the general names of varia<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and pard, (which last belongs to the males), to all the numerous species of this animal,which is very common in Africa and Syria.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> Some writersdistinguish the panther, as being remarkable for its whiteness:but as yet I have not observed any other difference betweenthem.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny, in B. xiii. c. 15, speaks of "tables of tiger and panther pattern," as articles of ornamental furniture among the Romans, named fromthe peculiar patterns of the veins in the citrus wood, of which they wereformed.—B.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This, though mentioned by Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. ix. c. 8, isprobably incorrect; and still more the addition made by Ælian, Anim. Nat.B. v. c. 40, that this odour is grateful to man. It has, however, inducedsome to conjecture, that the animal here described might be the civetbut the description given is inapplicable to that animal; nor, indeed, doesthe civet appear to have been known to the ancients. For further information, see the remarks of Cuvier, Ajasson, vol. vi. p. 420, and Lemaire,vol. iii. p. 386. Pliny, in B. xxi. c. 18, says that no animal, except thepanther, has any odour.—B.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Meaning the "spotted" or "parti-coloured" female.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Xenophon, in his Cynegetieon, says, that the pard is found on MountPangæus, in Macedonia; the truth of which is denied by Aristotle, whosays that it is not to be found in Europe.</p></body>
