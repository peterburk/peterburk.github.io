<div2 type="chapter" n="30" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 30.—MESOPOTAMIA.</head><p>The whole of Mesopotamia formerly belonged to the Assyrians, being covered with nothing but villages, with theexception of Babylonia<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and Ninus.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> The Macedonians<pb n="2071" />formed these communities into cities, being prompted theretoby the extraordinary fertility of the soil. Besides the citiesalready mentioned, it contains those of Seleucia,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> Laodicea,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>Artemita;<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> and in Arabia, the peoples known as theOrei<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> and the Mardani, besides Antiochia,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> founded by Nicanor, the governor of Mesopotamia, and called Arabis. Joining up to these in the interior is an Arabian people, calledthe Eldamani, and above them, upon the river Pallaconta, thetown of Bura, and the Arabian peoples known as the Salmani and the Masei. Up to the Gordyæi<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> join the Aloni,through whose territory runs the river Zerbis, which falls intothe Tigris; next are the Azones, the Silici, a mountaintribe, and the Orontes, to the west of whom lies the town ofGaugamela,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> as also Suë, situate upon the rocks. Beyondthese are the Silici, surnamed Classitæ, through whose district runs the river Lycus on its passage from Armenia, theAbsithris<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> running south-east, the town of Accobis, and then inthe plains the towns of Diospage, Polytelia,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> Stratonice, andAnthermis.<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> In the vicinity of the Euphrates is Nicephorion,of which we have<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> already stated that Alexander, struck with<pb n="2072" />the favourable situation of the spot, ordered it to be built. Wehave also similarly made mention<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> of Apamea on the Zeugma.Leaving that city and going eastward, we come to Caphrena,a fortified town, formerly seventy stadia in extent, and calledthe "Court of the Satraps." It was to this place that thetribute was conveyed; now it is reduced to a mere fortress.Thæbata is still in the same state as formerly: after whichcomes Oruros, which under Pompeius Magnus formed the extreme limit of the Roman Empire, distant from Zeugma twohundred and fifty miles. There are writers who say thatthe Euphrates was drawn off by an artificial channel by thegovernor Gobares, at the point where we have stated<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> that itbranches off,<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> in order that it might not commit damage in thecity of Babylonia, in consequence of the extreme rapidity ofits course. The Assyrians universally call this river by thename of Narmalcha,<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> which signifies the "royal river."At the point where its waters divide, there was in former timesa very large city, called Agranis, which the Persæ have de-stroyed.</p><p>Babylon, the capital of the nations of Chaldæa, long enjoyed the greatest celebrity of all cities throughout thewhole world: and it is from this place that the remainingparts of Mesopotamia and Assyria received the name of Babylonia. The circuit of its walls, which were two hundredfeet in height, was sixty miles. These walls were alsofifty feet in breadth, reckoning to every foot three fingers'breadth beyond the ordinary measure of our foot. Theriver Euphrates flowed through the city, with quays of marvellous workmanship erected on either side. The templethere<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> of Jupiter Belus<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> is still in existence; he was the first<pb n="2073" />inventor of the science of Astronomy. In all other respectsit has been reduced to a desert, having been drained of itspopulation in consequence of its vicinity to Seleucia,<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> foundedfor that purpose by Nicator, at a distance of ninety miles, onthe confluence of the Tigris and the canal that leads from theEuphrates. Seleucia, however, still bears the surname ofBabylonia: it is a free and independent city, and retains thefeatures of the Macedonian manners. It is said that thepopulation of this city amounts to six hundred thousand, andthat the outline of its walls resembles an eagle with expandedwings: its territory, they say, is the most fertile in all the East.The Parthi again, in its turn, founded Ctesiphon,<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> for thepurpose of drawing away the population of Seleucia, at a distance of nearly three miles, and in the district of Chalonitis;Ctesiphon is now the capital of all the Parthian kingdoms.Finding, however, that this city did not answer the intendedpurpose, king Vologesus<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> has of late years founded anothercity in its vicinity, Vologesocerta<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span> by name. Besides theabove, there are still the following towns in Mesopotamia: Hipparenum,<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span> rendered famous, like Babylon, by the learning of<pb n="2074" />the Chaldæi, and situate near the river Narraga,<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span> which fallsinto the Narroga, from which a city so called has taken itsname. The Persæ destroyed the walls of Hipparenum.Orchenus also, a third place of learning of the Chaldæi, issituate in the same district, towards the south; after whichcome the Notitæ, the Orothophanitæ, and the Grecichartæ.<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span>From Nearchus and Onesicritus we learn that the distance bywater from the Persian Sea to Babylon, up the Euphrates, isfour hundred and twelve miles; other authors, however, whohave written since their time, say that the distance to Seleucia is four hundred and forty miles: and Juba says thatthe distance from Babylon to Charax is one hundred andseventy-five. Some writers state that the Euphrates continues to flow with an undivided channel for a distance ofeighty-seven miles beyond Babylon, before its waters are diverted from their channel for the purposes of irrigation; andthat the whole length of its course is not less than twelvehundred miles. The circumstance that so many differentauthors have treated of this subject, accounts for all thesevariations, seeing that even the Persian writers themselves donot agree as to what is the length of their <hi rend="ital">schœni</hi> and <hi rend="ital">para-</hi><hi rend="ital">sangœ,</hi> each assigning to them a different length.</p><p>When the Euphrates ceases, by running in its channel, toafford protections<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span> to those who dwell on its banks, which it doeswhen it approaches the confines of Charax, the country is immediately infested by the Attali, a predatory people of Arabia,beyond whom are found the Scenite.<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span> The banks along thisriver are occupied by the Nomades of Arabia, as far as thedeserts of Syria, from which, as we have already stated,<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span> ittakes a turn to the south,<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span> and leaves the solitary deserts ofPalmyra. Seleucia is distant, by way of the Euphrates, fromthe beginning of Mesopotamia, eleven hundred and twenty-<pb n="2075" />five; from the Red Sea, by way of the Tigris, two hundred and twenty; and from Zeugma, seven hundred andtwenty-three, miles. Zeugma is distant from Seleucia<span id="ref_31"><a href="#note_31">[31]</a></span> inSyria, on the shores of our sea, one hundred and seventy-five<span id="ref_32"><a href="#note_32">[32]</a></span>miles. Such is the extent of the land that lies in these partsbetween the two seas.<span id="ref_33"><a href="#note_33">[33]</a></span> The length of the kingdom of Parthiais nine hundred and eighteen miles.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The great seat of empire of the Babylonio-Chaldæan kingdom. Iteither occupied the site, it is supposed, or stood in the immediate vicinityof the tower of Babel. In the reign of Labynedus, Nabonnetus, or Bel-shazzar, it was taken by Cyrus. In the reign of Augustus, a small partonly of Babylon was still inhabited, the remainder of the space within thewalls being under cultivation. The ruins of Babylon are found to commencea little south of the village of Mohawill, eight miles north of Hillah.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Nineveh.

Its site has been a matter of considerable discussion, but the most probable opinion is, that it stood on thewestern bank of the Tigris, to the north of its junction with the royalcanal (probably the river Chobar above mentioned), opposite to the mouthof the river Delas or Silla (now Diala), and to the spot where Ctesiphonwas afterwards built by the Parthians. It stood a little to the south ofthe modern city of Baghdad; thus commanding the navigation of theTigris and Euphrates, and the whole plain formed by those two rivers.</p><p><span id="note_21"><a href="#ref_21">21. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ammianus, like Pliny, has ascribed its foundation to the Parthiansunder Varanes, or Vardanes, of whom, however, nothing is known. Itstood in the south of Assyria, on the eastern or left bank of the Tigris.Strabo speaks of it as being the winter residence of the Parthian kings,who lived there at that season, owing to the mildness of the climate. Inmodern times the site of this place has been identified with that called bythe Arabs Al Madain, or the "two cities."</p><p><span id="note_22"><a href="#ref_22">22. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or Vologeses.
