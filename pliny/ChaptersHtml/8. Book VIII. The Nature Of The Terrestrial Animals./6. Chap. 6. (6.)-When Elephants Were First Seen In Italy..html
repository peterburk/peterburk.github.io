(6.)ÑWHEN ELEPHANTS WERE FIRST SEEN IN ITALY.</head><p>Elephants were seen in Italy, for the first time, in the warwith King Pyrrhus,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> in the year of the City 472; they werecalled "Lucanian oxen," because they were first seen in Lucania.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> Seven years after this period, they appeared at Romein a triumph.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> In the year 502 a great number of them werebrought to Rome, which had been taken by the pontiff Metellus, in his victory gained in Sicily over the Carthaginians;<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>they were one hundred and forty-two<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> in number, or, as somesay, one hundred and forty, and were conveyed to our shoresupon rafts, which were constructed on rows of hogsheads joinedtogether. Verrius informs us, that they fought in the Circus,<pb n="2252" />and that they were slain with javelins, for want of some bettermethod of disposing of them; as the people neither liked tokeep them nor yet to give them to the kings.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> L. Piso tellsus only that they were brought into the Circus; and for thepurpose of increasing the feeling of contempt towards them,they were driven all round the area of that place by workmen, who had nothing but spears blunted at the point. Theauthors who are of opinion that they were not killed, do not,however, inform us how they were afterwards disposed of.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In the Epitome of Livy, B. xiii., it is said, that Valerius Corvinuswas unsuccessful in his engagements with Pyrrhus, in consequence of theterror produced by the elephants.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Varro, De Ling.
