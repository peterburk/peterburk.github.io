Spiders, too, are especiallyhostile to bees; when they have gone so far as to build theirwebs within the hive, the death of the whole swarm is the result.The common and ignoble moth,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> too, that is to be seen flutteringabout a burning candle, is deadly to them, and that in moreways than one. It devours the wax, and leaves its ordurebehind it, from which the maggot known to us as the " teredo"is produced; besides which, wherever it goes, it drops thedown from off its wings, and thereby thickens the threads ofthe cobwebs. The teredo is also engendered in the wood ofthe hive, and then it proves especially destructive to the wax.Bees are the victims, also, of their own greediness, for whenthey glut themselves overmuch with the juices of the flowers, inthe spring season more particularly, they are troubled withflux and looseness. Olive oil is fatal<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> to not only bees, butall other insects as well, and more especially if they are placed<pb n="3023" />in the sun, after the head has been immersed in it. Sometimes, too, they themselves are the cause of their own destruction; as, for instance, when they see preparations beingmade for taking their honey, and immediately fall to devouring it with the greatest avidity. In other respects they areremarkable for their abstemiousness, and they will expelthose that are inclined to be prodigal and voracious, no less thanthose that are sluggish and idle. Their own honey even maybe productive of injury to them; for if they are smeared withit on the fore-part of the body, it is fatal to them. Such arethe enemies, so numerous are the accidents—and how small aportion of them have I here enumerated!—to which a creature that proves so bountiful to us is exposed. In the appropriate place<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> we will treat of the proper remedies; for thepresent the nature of them is our subject.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There are two kinds of hive-moth—the Phalæna tinea mellanella oflinnæus, and the Phalæna tortrix cereana.
