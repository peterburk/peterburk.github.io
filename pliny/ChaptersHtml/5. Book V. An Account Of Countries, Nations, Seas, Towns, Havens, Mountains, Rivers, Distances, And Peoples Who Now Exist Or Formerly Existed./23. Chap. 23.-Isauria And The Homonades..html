<div2 type="chapter" n="23" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 23.ÑISAURIA AND THE HOMONADES.</head><p>All the geographers have mentioned Pamphylia as joiningup to Cilicia, without taking any notice of the people ofIsauria<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>. Its cities are, in the interior, Isaura<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>, Clibanus,and Lalasis; it runs down towards the sea by the side ofAnemurium<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> already mentioned. In a similar manner also,all who have treated of this subject have been ignorant ofthe existence of the nation of the Homonades bordering uponIsauria, and their town of Homona<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> in the interior. Thereare forty-four other fortresses, which lie concealed amidrugged crags and valleys.<pb n="1451" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It bordered in the east on Lycaonia, in the north on Phrygia, in the west on Pisidia, and in the south on Cilicia and Pamphylia.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A well-fortified city at the foot of Mount Taurus. It was twice destroyed, first by its inhabitants when besieged by Perdiccas, and again by the Roman general Servilius Isauricus. Strabo says that Amyntas of Galatea built a new city in its vicinity out of the ruins of the old one. D'Anville and others have identified the site of Old Isauria with the modern Bei Sheher, and they are of opinion that Seidi Sheher occupies the site of. New Isaura, but Hamilton thinks that the ruins on a hill near the village of Olou Bounar mark the site of New Isaura. Of the two next places nothing seems to be known at the present day.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In the last Chapter.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In Pisidia, at the southern extremity of Lake Caralitis. Tacitus, Annals, iii. 48, says that this people possessed forty-four fortresses: whereas Strabo speaks of them as the most barbarous of all the Pisidian tribes, dwelling only in caves. They were conquered by the consul Quirinius in the time of Augustus.</p></body>
