They attribute to it also the property ofensuring success to petitions preferred to potentates, and toprayers even offered to the gods; and they regard it as aremedy for various diseases, and as an amulet preservativeagainst all noxious spells. Some give it the name of "Saturn'sblood."<pb n="5395" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. viii. c. 33.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Magi of the East, probably.</p></body>
