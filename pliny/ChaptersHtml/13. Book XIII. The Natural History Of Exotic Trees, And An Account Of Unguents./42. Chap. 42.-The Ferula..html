For, in fact, we distinguish the trees into several different kinds: it is the natureof some to have wood entirely in place of bark, or, in other<pb n="3205" />words, on the outside; while, in the interior, in place of wood,there is a fungous kind of pith, like that of the elder;others, again, are hollow within, like the reed. The ferulagrows in hot countries and in places beyond sea, the stalkbeing divided into knotted joints. There are two kinds of it;that which grows upwards to a great height the Greeks callby the name of "narthex,"<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> while the other, which neverrises far from the ground, is known as the "narthecya."<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>From the joints very large leaves shoot forth, the largest lyingnearest to the ground: in other respects it has the same nature as the anise, which it resembles also in its fruit. Thewood of no shrub is lighter than this; hence it is very easilycarried, and the stalks of it make good walking-sticks<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> forthe aged.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably the Ferula communis of Linnæus, the herb or shrubknown as ".fennel giant."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Ferula glauca of Linnæus.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Ferula nodiflora of Linnæus.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is still used for that purpose in the south of Europe. The Romanschoolmasters, as we learn from Juvenal, Martial, and others, employed itfor the chastisement of their scholars. Pliny is in error in reckoning itamong the trees, it really having no pretensions to be considered such.It is said to have received its name from "ferio," to "beat."</p></body>
