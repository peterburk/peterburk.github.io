The same is the case, too, with the refuse of the cur-rier's workshop, unless it is well diluted with water: manurewill scorch also, if laid on land too plentifully. It is generallyconsidered the proper proportion, to use three modii to every tenfeet square; this, however, the nature of the soil must decide.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Agriculturists, Fée says, are not agreed upon this question.</p></body>
