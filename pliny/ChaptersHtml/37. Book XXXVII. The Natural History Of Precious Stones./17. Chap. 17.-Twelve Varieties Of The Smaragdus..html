<div2 type="chapter" n="17" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 17.ÑTWELVE VARIETIES OF THE SMARAGDUS.</head><p>Of this stone there are no less than twelve different kinds;of which the finest is the Scythian<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> smaragdus, so called fromthe country where it is found. None of them has a deepercolour than this, or is more free from defects: indeed, in thesame degree that the smaragdus is superior to other preciousstones, the Scythian smaragdus is superior to the other varieties.Next in esteem to this, as also in locality, is the smaragdusof Bactriana.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> These stones are collected, it is said, in thefissures of rocks, when the Etesian<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> winds prevail; a periodat which the earth that covers them is removed, and the stonesare detected by their brightness, the sands being greatly agitatedby the action of the winds. These last, however, aremuch inferior, they say, to those of Scythia in size. The thirdrank is held by the stones of Egypt,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> which are extracted fromthe hills in the vicinity of Coptos, a city of Thebais.</p><p>All the other kinds are found in copper-mines, and hence itis that, of these varieties, the smaragdus of Cyprus holds thehighest rank. The merit of them consists in their clear colour,which has nothing thin or diluted in it, but presents a richand humid transparency, closely resembling the tints of thesea, in fact. Hence it is that these stones are at once diaphanousand shining, or, in other words, reflect their colours andallow the vision to penetrate within. They say that in thisisland, upon the tomb of a petty king named Hermias, nearthe fisheries<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> there, there was formerly a lion in marble, witheyes made of smaragdi; the brilliancy of which penetrated<pb n="6411" />the sea to such a degree, as to alarm the tunnies and put themto flight: a novel circumstance, which for a long time excitedwonder in the fishermen, till at last the stones in the statuewere changed for others.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ajasson is of opinion that the Dioptase, Siberian emerald, or Malachiteemerald is meant.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ajasson thinks that this may be the Dioptase or Achirite of ChineseBucharia; and that the merchant Achir Mahmed, from whom it takes itsname, was by no means the first to introduce it, or to circulate his wonderfulstories as to its formation.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. ii. cc. 47, 48, and B. xviii. c. 74.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Mount Zalora, in Upper Egypt, still produces emeralds, and was probablythe only locality of the <hi rend="ital">genuine</hi> stone that was known to the ancients.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Cetarias,"</p></body>
