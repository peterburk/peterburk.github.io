(52.)ÑSUPERFLUOUS LIMBS.</head><p>Supernumerary limbs, when they grow on animals, are ofno use, which is the case also with the sixth finger, when itgrows on man. It was thought proper in Egypt to rear ahuman monster, that had two additional eves in the back partof the head; it could not see with them, however.<pb n="3096" /></p></div2></body>
