It is then made up into balls, which are introducedwith the hand into the paunch, the result of which is, that thevigour and muscular strength of the animal is considerablyincreased. In some kinds of barley, the ears have two rowsof grains,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and in others more; in some cases, as many as six.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>The grain itself, too, presents certain differences, being longand thin, or else short or round, white, black,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> or, in someinstances, of a purple colour. This last kind is employed formaking polenta: the white is ill adapted for standing the severity of the weather. Barley is the softest of all the grains:it can only be sown in a dry, loose soil,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> but fertile withal.The chaff of barley ranks among the very best; indeed, forlitter there is none that can be compared with it. Of all grain,barley is the least exposed to accidents, as it is gathered beforethe time that mildew begins to attack wheat; for which reasonit is that the provident agriculturist sows only as much wheat<pb n="4031" />as may be required for food. The saying is, that "barley issown in a money-bag," because it so soon returns a profit.The most prolific kind of all is that which is got in at Carthage,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> in Spain, in the month of April. It is in the samemonth that it is sown in Celtiberia, and yet it yields two harvests in the same year. All kinds of barley are cut sooner thanother grain, and immediately after they are ripe; for the strawis extremely brittle, and the grain is enclosed in a husk of remarkable thinness. It is said, too, that a better polenta<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> ismade from it, if it is gathered before it is perfectly ripe.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Hordeum distichum of Linnæus.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hordeum hexastichum of Linnæus.
