<div2 type="chapter" n="27" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 27.—REMEDIES FOR EPILEPSY.</head><p>For the cure of epilepsy wool-grease is used, with a modicum of myrrh, a piece about the size of a hazel-nut being dissolved and taken after the bath, in two cyathi of wine: aram's testes, also, dried and pounded, and taken in doses ofhalf a denarius, in water, or in a semi-sextarius of asses'milk; the patient being forbidden wine five days before andafter using the remedy. Sheep's blood, too, is mightily praised,taken in drink; sheep's gall, also, and lambs' gall in particular,mixed with honey; the flesh of a sucking puppy, taken withwine and myrrh, the head and feet being first removed; thecallosities from a mule's legs, taken in three cyathi of oxymel;the ashes of a spotted lizard from beyond seas, taken in vinegar; the thin coat of a spotted lizard, which it casts like asnake, taken in drink—indeed some persons recommend thelizard itself; gutted with a reed and dried and taken in drink;while others, again, are for roasting it on a wooden spit andtaking it with the food.</p><p>It is worth while knowing how the winter slough of this<pb n="5451" />lizard is obtained when it casts it off, before it has had the opportunity of devouring<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> it; there being no creature, it is said, thatresorts in its spite to more cunning devices for the deception ofman; a circumstance owing to which, the name of "stellio"<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>his been borrowed as a name of reproach. The place to whichit retires in summer is carefully observed, being generally somespot beneath the projecting parts of doors or windows, or elsein vaults or tombs. In the early days of spring, cages madeof split reeds are placed before these spots; and the narrowerthe interstices the more delighted is the animal with them,it being all the better enabled thereby to disengage itself ofthe coat which adheres to its body and impedes its freedom ofaction: when, however, it has once quitted it, the construction of the cage prevents its return. There is nothing whatever preferred to this lizard as a remedy for epilepsy. Thebrains of a weasel are also considered very good, dried andtaken in drink; the liver, too, of that animal, or the testes,uterus, or paunch, dried and taken with coriander, in manneralready<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> mentioned; the ashes also of a burnt weasel; or awild weasel, eaten whole with the food. All these propertiesare equally attributed to the ferret. A green lizard is some-times eaten, dressed with seasonings to stimulate the appetite,the feet and head being first removed; the ashes, too, of burntsnails are used, as an ointment, with linseed, nettle-seed, andhoney.</p><p>The magicians think highly of a dragon's tail, attached tothe body, with a deer's sinews, in the skin of a gazelle; asalso the small grits found in the crops of young swallows,tied to the left arm of the patient; for swallows, it is said, givesmall stones to their young the moment they are hatched.If, at the commencement of the first paroxysm, an epilepticpatient eats the first of a swallow's brood that has beenhatched, he will experience a perfect cure: but at a laterperiod the disease is treated by using swallow's blood withfrankincense, or by eating the heart of the bird quite fresh.Nay, even more than this, a small stone taken from aswallow's nest will relieve the patient the moment it is applied, they say; worn, too, as an amulet, it will always act as<pb n="5452" />a preservative against the malady. A kite's liver, too, eatenby the patient, is highly vaunted; the slough also of a serpent; a vulture's liver, beaten up with the blood of the bird,and taken thrice seven days in drink; or the heart of a youngvulture, worn attached to the body.</p><p>And not only this, but the vulture itself is recommended asa food for the patient, and that, too, when it has been gluttedwith human flesh. Some recommend the breast of this birdto be taken in drink from a cup made of cerrus<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> wood, or thetestes of a dunghill cock to be taken in milk and water; thepatient abstaining from wine the five preceding days, and thetestes being dried for the purpose. There have been authorities found to recommend one-and-twenty red flies-and thosefound dead, too!-taken in drink, the number being reducedwhere the patient is of a feeble habit.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. viii. c. 49.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A cozener, cheat, or rogue.
