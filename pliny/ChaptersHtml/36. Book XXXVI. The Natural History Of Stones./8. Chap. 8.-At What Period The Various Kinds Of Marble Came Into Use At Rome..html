Catulus, was thefirst to have the lintels of his house made of Numidian marble,a thing for which he was greatly censured: he was consul inthe year of Rome, 676. This is the earliest instance that Ican find of the introduction of Numidian marble; not in theform of pillars, however, or of slabs, as was the case with themarble of Carystus, above-mentioned, but in blocks, and thattoo, for the comparatively ignoble purpose of making thethresholds of doors. Four years after this Lepidus, L. Luculluswas consul; the same person who gave its name, it isvery evident, to the Lucullan marble; for, taking a great fancyto it, he introduced it at Rome. While other kinds of marbleare valued for their spots or their colours, this marble is entirelyblack.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> It is found in the island of Melos,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and ispretty nearly the only marble that has taken its name fromthe person who first introduced it. Among these personages,Scaurus, in my opinion, was the first to build a theatre withwalls of marble: but whether they were only coated withslabs of marble or were made of solid blocks highly polished,such as we now see in the Temple of Jupiter Tonans,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> in theCapitol, I cannot exactly say: for, up to this period, I cannotfind any vestiges of the use of marble slabs in Italy.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The black marbles, Ajasson remarks, are comparatively rare. He isof opinion that the colour of the Lucullan marble was the <hi rend="ital">noir antique</hi> ofthe French, and says that it is to be found at Bergamo, Carrara, Prato inTuscany, and near Spa in Belgium.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Chios" is another reading.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Thundering Jupiter."
