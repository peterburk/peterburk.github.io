PERILEUCOS. PÆANITIS OR GÆANIS.</head><p>Panchrus<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> is a stone which displays nearly every colour.Pangonus<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> is no longer than the finger: the only thing thatprevents it from being taken for a crystal, is, its greater numberof angles. What kind of stone paneros<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> is, Metrodorus doesnot inform us; but he gives some lines, by no means withoutelegance, that were written upon this stone by Queen Timaris,and dedicated to Venus; from which we have reason to concludethat certain fecundating virtues were attributed to it. Bysome writers it is called panerastos.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> Of the stone called"pontica"<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> there are numerous varieties: one is stellated, andpresents either blood-red spots, or drops like gold, being reckonedin the number of the sacred stones. Another, in place ofstars, has streaks of the same colour, and a fourth presents allthe appearance of mountains and valleys.<pb n="6456" /></p><p>Phloginos,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> also called "chrysitis,"<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> strongly resemblesAttic ochre,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> and is found in Egypt. Phœnicitis<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> is a stoneso called from its resemblance to a date. Phycitis receives itsname from its resemblance to sea-weed.<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> Perileucos<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> is thename given to a gem, in which a white colour runs down fromthe margin of the stone to the base. Pæanitis,<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> by some called"gæanis,"<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> conceives, it is said, and is good for femalesat the time of parturition: this stone is found in Macedonia,near the monument<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> of Tiresias there, and has all the appearanceof congealed water.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Of all colours."
