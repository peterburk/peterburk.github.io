<div2 type="chapter" n="76" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 76.ÑSEVENTEEN REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE VIOLET.</head><p>There are both wild and cultivated violets.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> The purpleviolet is of a cooling nature: for inflammations they are applied to the stomach in the burning heats, and for pains in thehead they are applied to the forehead. Violets, in particular,are used for defluxions of the eyes, prolapsus of the fundamentand uterus, and suppurations. Worn in chaplets upon thehead, or even smelt at, they dispel the fumes of wine and headache; and, taken in water, they are a cure for quinsy. Thepurple violet, taken in water, is a remedy for epilcpsy, inchildren more particularly: violet seed is good for the stingsof scorpions.</p><p>On the other hand, the flower of the white violet opens suppurations, and the plant itself disperses them. Both the whiteand the yellow violet check the menstrual discharge, and actas diuretics. When fresh gathered, they have less virtue, andhence it is that they are mostly used dry, after being kept ayear. The yellow violet, taken in doses of half a cyathus tothree cyathi of water, promotes the eatamenia; and the rootsof it, applied with vinegar, assuage affections of the spleen, asalso the gout. Mixed with myrrh and saffron, they are goodfor inflammation of the eyes. The leaves, applied with honey,cleanse ulcerous sores of the head, and, combined with cerate,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>they are good for chaps of the fundament and other moist partsof the body. Employed with vinegar, they effect the cure ofabscesses.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See c. 14 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">An ointment made of wax and oil.</p></body>
