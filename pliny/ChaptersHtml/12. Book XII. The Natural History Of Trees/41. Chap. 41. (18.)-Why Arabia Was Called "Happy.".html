<div2 type="chapter" n="41" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 41. (18.)—WHY ARABIA WAS CALLED "HAPPY."</head><p>Arabia produces neither cinnamon nor cassia; and this isthe country styled "Happy" Arabia! False and ungratefuldoes she prove herself in the adoption of this surname, whichshe would imply to have been received from the gods above;whereas, in reality, she is indebted for it far more to the gods<pb n="3137" />below.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> It is the luxury which is displayed by man, even inthe paraphernalia of death, that has rendered Arabia thus"happy;" and which prompts him to burn with the deadwhat was originally understood to have been produced for theservice of the gods. Those who are likely to be the bestacquainted with the matter, assert that this country does notproduce, in a whole year, so large a quantity of perfumes aswas burnt by the Emperor Nero at the funeral obsequies ofhis wife Poppæa. And then let us only take into accountthe vast number of funerals that are celebrated throughout thewhole world each year, and the heaps of odours that arepiled up in honour of the bodies of the dead; the vast quantities, too, that are offered to the gods in single grains; and yet,when men were in the habit of offering up to them the saltedcake, they did not show themselves any the less propitious;nay, rather, as the facts themselves prove, they were evenmore favourable to us than they are now. But it is the sea ofArabia that has even a still greater right to be called "happy,"for it is this that furnishes us with pearls. At the very lowestcomputation, India, the Seres, and the Arabian Peninsula,withdraw from our empire one hundred millions of sestercesevery year—so dearly do we pay for our luxury and ourwomen. How large a portion, too, I should like to know, ofall these perfumes, really comes to the gods of heaven, and thedeities of the shades below?</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Because its perfumes were held in such high esteem, for burning onthe piles of the dead. This, of course, was done primarily to avoid theoffensive smell.</p></body>
