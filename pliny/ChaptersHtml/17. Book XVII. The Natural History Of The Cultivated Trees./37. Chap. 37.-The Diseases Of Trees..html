<div2 type="chapter" n="37" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 37.—THE DISEASES OF TREES.</head><p>Having now treated sufficiently at length of the planting<pb n="3518" />and cultivation of trees—(for we have already said enough ofthe palm<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and the cytisus,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> when speaking of the exotictrees)—we shall proceed, in order that nothing may be omitted,to describe other details relative to their nature, which are ofconsiderable importance, when taken in connection with allthat precedes. Trees, we find, are attacked by maladies;and, indeed, what created thing is there that is exempt fromthese evils? Still however, the affections of the forest trees,it is said, are not attended<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> with danger to them, and theonly damage they receive is from hail-storms while they arebudding and blossoming; with the exception, indeed, of beingnipped either by heat or cold blasts in unseasonable weather;for frost, when it comes at the proper times, as we have alreadystated,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> is serviceable to them. "Well but," it will be said,"is not the vine sometimes killed with cold?" No doubt it is,and this it is through which we detect inherent faults in thesoils, for it is only in a cold soil that the vine will die. Just inthe same way, too, in winter we approve of cold, so long asit is the cold of the weather, and not of the ground. It is notthe weakest trees, too, that are endangered in winter by frost,but the larger ones. When they are thus attacked, it is thesummit that dries away the first, from the circumstance thatthe sap becomes frozen before it is able to arrive there.</p><p>Some diseases of trees are common to them all, whileothers, again, are peculiar to individual kinds, Worms<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> arecommon to them all, and so, too, is sideration,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> with pains inthe limbs,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> which are productive of debility in the variousparts. Thus do we apply the names of the maladies that prevail among mankind to those with which the plants areafflicted. In the same way, too, we speak of their bodies beingmutilated, the eyes of the buds being burnt up, with manyother expressions of a similar nature. It is in accordancewith the same phraseology that we say that trees are afflictedwith hunger or indigestion, both of which result from the<pb n="3519" />comparative amount of sap that they contain; while some,again, are troubled with obesity, as in the case of all the resinous trees, which, when suffering from excessive fatness, arechanged into a torch-tree.<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> When the roots, too, begin towax fat, trees, like animals, are apt to perish from excess offatness. Sometimes, too, a pestilence<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> will prevail in certainclasses of trees, just as among men, we see maladies attack,at one time the slave class, and at another the common people,in cities or in the country, as the case may be.</p><p>Trees are more or less attacked by worms; but still, nearlyall are subject to them in some degree, and this the birds<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> areable to detect by the hollow sound produced on tapping atthe bark. These worms even have now begun to be lookedupon as delicacies<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> by epicures, and the large ones found inthe robur are held in high esteem; they are known to us bythe name of" cossis;" and are even fed with meal, in orderto fatten them! But it is the pear, the apple, and the fig<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>that are most subject to their attacks, the trees that are bitterand odoriferous enjoying a comparative exemption from them.Of those which infest the fig, some breed in the tree itself,while others, again, are produced by the worm known as thecerastes; they all, however, equally assume the form of thecerastes,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> and emit a small shrill noise. The service-tree isinfested, too, with a red hairy worm, which kills it; and themedlar, when old, is subject to a similar malady.</p><p>The disease known as sideration entirely depends upon theheavens; and hence we may class under this head, the ill<pb n="3520" />effects produced by hail-storms, carbunculation,<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> and thedamage caused by hoar-frosts. When the approach of springtempts the still tender shoots to make their appearance, andthey venture to burst forth, the malady attacks them, andscorches up the eyes of the buds, filled as they are withtheir milky juices: this is what upon flowers they call " charcoal"<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> blight. The consequences of hoar-frost to plants areeven more dangerous still, for when it has once settled, itremains there in a frozen form, and there is never any wind toremove it, seeing that it never prevails except in weather thatis perfectly calm and serene. Sideration, however, properlyso called, is a certain heat and dryness that prevails at therising of the<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> Dog-star, and owing to which grafts and youngtrees pine away and die, the fig and the vine more particularly. The olive, also, besides the worm, to which it is equallysubject with the fig, is attacked by the measles,<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> or as somethink fit to call it, the fungus or platter; it is a sort of blastproduced by the heat of the sun. Cato<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> says that the redmoss<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> is also deleterious to the olive. An excessive fertility,too, is very often injurious to the vine and the olive. Scab is amalady common to all trees. Eruptions,<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> too, and the attacksof a kind of snail that grows on the bark, are diseases peculiarto the fig, but not in all countries; for there are some maladiesthat are prevalent in certain localities only.</p><p>In the same way that man is subject to diseases of the sinews, so are the trees as well, and, like him, in two differentways. Either<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> the virulence of the disease manifests itself inthe feet, or, what is the same thing, the roots of the tree, orelse in the joints of the fingers, or, in other words, the extremities of the branches that are most distant from the trunk.The parts that are thus affected become dry and shrivel up:the Greeks have appropriate names<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> by which to distinguish<pb n="3521" />each of these affections. In either case the first symptoms arethat the tree is suffering from pain, and the parts affected become emaciated and brittle; then follows rapid consumptionand ultimately death; the juices being no longer able to enterthe diseased parts, or, at all events, not circulating in them.The fig is more particularly liable to this disease: but thewild fig is exempt from all that we have hitherto mentioned.Scab<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span> is produced by viscous dews which fall after the risingof the Vergiliæ; but if they happen to fall copiously, theydrench the tree, without making the bark rough. When thefig is thus attacked, the fruit falls off while green; and so, too,if there is too much rain. The fig suffers also from a superfluity of moisture in the roots.</p><p>In addition to worms and sideration, the vine is subject toa peculiar disease of its own, which attacks it in the joints,and is produced from one of the three following causes:—either the destruction of the buds by stormy weather, or elsethe fact, as remarked by Theophrastus, that the tree, whenpruned, has been cut with the incisions upwards,<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span> or has beeninjured from want of skill in the cultivator. All the injurythat is inflicted in these various ways is felt by the tree in thejoints more particularly. It must be considered also as aspecies of sideration, when the cold dews make the blossomsfall off, and when the grapes harden<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span> before they have attainedtheir proper size. Vines also become sickly when they areperished with cold, and the eyes are frost-bitten just after theyhave been pruned. Heat, too, out of season, is productive ofsimilar results: for everything is regulated according to a fixedorder and certain determinate movements. Some maladies,too, originate in errors committed by the vine-dresser; whenthey are tied too tight, for instance, as already mentioned,<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span> orwhen in trenching round them the digger has struck them anunlucky blow, or when in ploughing about them the roots havebeen strained through carelessness, or the bark has beenstripped from off the trunk: sometimes, too, contusions areproduced by the use of too blunt a pruning-knife. Throughall the causes thus enumerated the tree is rendered more sen-<pb n="3522" />sitive to either cold or heat, as every injurious influence fromwithout is apt to concentrate in the wounds thus made. Theapple, however, is the most delicate of them all, and moreparticularly the one that bears the sweetest fruit. In sometrees weakness induced by disease is productive of barrenness,and does not kill the tree; as in the pine<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span> for instance, or thepalm, when the top of the tree has been removed; for in suchcase the tree becomes barren, but does not die. Sometimes, too,the fruit itself is sickly, independently of the tree; for example,when there is a deficiency of rain, or of warmth, or of wind,at the periods at which they usually prevail, or when, on theother hand, they have prevailed in excess; for in such cases thefruit will either drop off or else deteriorate. But the worstthing of all that can befall the vine or the olive, is to be peltedwith heavy showers just when the tree is shedding its blossom,for then the fruit is sure to fall off<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span> as well.</p><p>Rain, too, is productive of the caterpillar, a noxious insectthat eats away the leaves, and, some of them, the blossoms aswell; and this in the olive even, as we find the case at Miletus;giving to the half-eaten tree a most loathsome appearance. Thispest is produced by the prevalence of a damp, languid heat;and if the sun should happen to shine after this with a moreintense heat and burn them up, this pest only gives place toanother<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span> just as bad, the aspect only of the evil being changed.</p><p>There is still one other affection that is peculiar to the oliveand the vine, known as the "cobweb," <span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span> the fruit being enveloped in a web, as it were, and so stifled. There are certainwinds, too, that are particularly blighting to the olive and thevine, as also to other fruits as well: and then besides, the fruitsthemselves, independently of the tree, are very much worm-eaten in some years, the apple, pear, medlar, and pomegranatefor instance. In the olive the presence of the worm may be<pb n="3523" />productive of a twofold result: if it grows beneath the skin,it will destroy the fruit, but if it is in the stone, it will onlygnaw it away, making the fruit all the larger. The prevalenceof showers after the rising of Arcturus<span id="ref_31"><a href="#note_31">[31]</a></span> prevents them frombreeding; but if the rains are accompanied with wind fromthe south, they will make their appearance in the ripe fruiteven, which are then very apt to fall. This happens moreparticularly in moist, watery localities; and even if they donot fall, the olives that are so affected are good for nothing.There is a kind of fly also that is very troublesome to somefruit, acorns and figs for instance: it would appear that theybreed from the juices<span id="ref_32"><a href="#note_32">[32]</a></span> secreted beneath the bark, which atthis period are sweet. These trees, too, are generally in adiseased state when this happens.</p><p>There are certain temporary and local influences which causeinstantaneous death to trees, but which cannot properly betermed diseases; such, for example, as consumption, blast, orthe noxious effects of some winds that are peculiar to certainlocalities; of this last nature are the Atabulus<span id="ref_33"><a href="#note_33">[33]</a></span> that prevailsin Apulia, and the Olympias<span id="ref_34"><a href="#note_34">[34]</a></span> of Eubœa. This wind, if ithappens to blow about the winter solstice, nips the tree withcold, and shrivels it up to such a degree that no warmth of thesun can ever revive it. Trees that are planted in valleys, andare situate near the banks of rivers, are especially liable tothese accidents, the vine more particularly, the olive, and thefig. When this has been the case, it may instantly be detectedthe moment the period for germination arrives, though, in theolive, somewhat later. With all of these trees, if the leavesfall off, it is a sign that they will recover; but if such is notthe case, just when you would suppose that they have escapeduninjured, they die. Sometimes, however, the leaves willbecome green again, after being dry and shrivelled. Othertrees, again, in the northern regions, Pontus and Phrygia, forexample, suffer greatly from cold or frost, in case they shouldcontinue for forty days after the winter solstice. In thesecountries, too, as well as in other parts, if a sharp frost or copious rains should happen to come on immediately after fructification, the fruit is killed in a very few days even.<pb n="3524" /></p><p>Injuries inflicted by the hand of man are productive also ofbad effects. Thus, for instance, pitch, oil, and grease,<span id="ref_35"><a href="#note_35">[35]</a></span> if applied to trees, and young ones more particularly, are highlydetrimental. They may be killed, also, by removing a circularpiece of the bark from around them, with the exception, indeed, of the cork-tree,<span id="ref_36"><a href="#note_36">[36]</a></span> which is rather benefitted than otherwise by the operation; for the bark as it gradually thickenstends to stifle and suffocate the tree: the andrachle,<span id="ref_37"><a href="#note_37">[37]</a></span> too, receives no injury from it, if care is taken not to cut the bodyof the tree. In addition to this, the cherry, the lime, and thevine shed their bark;<span id="ref_38"><a href="#note_38">[38]</a></span> not that portion of it, indeed, which isessential to life, and grows next the trunk, but the part thatis thrown off, in proportion as the other grows beneath. Insome trees the bark is naturally full of fissures, the plane forinstance: in the linden it will all but grow again when removed. Hence, in those trees the bark of which admits ofcicatrization, a mixture of clay and dung<span id="ref_39"><a href="#note_39">[39]</a></span> is employed by wayof remedy; and sometimes with success, in case excessive coldor heat does not immediately supervene. In some trees, again,by the adoption of these methods death is only retarded, therobur and the quercus,<span id="ref_40"><a href="#note_40">[40]</a></span> for example. The season of the yearhas also its peculiar influences; thus, if the bark is removedfrom the fir and the pine, while the sun is passing throughTaurus or Gemini, the period of their germination, they willinstantly die, while in winter they are able to withstand theinjurious effects of it much longer: the same is the case, too,with the holm-oak, the robur, and the quercus. In the treesabove mentioned, if it is only a narrow circular strip of barkthat is removed, no injurious effects will be perceptible; butin the case of the weaker trees, as well as those which grow ina thin soil, the same operation, if performed even on one sideonly, will be sure to kill them. The removal of the top,<span id="ref_41"><a href="#note_41">[41]</a></span> in<pb n="3525" />the pitch-tree, the cedar, and the cypress is productive of asimilar result; for if it is either cut off or destroyed by fire,the tree will not survive: the same is the case, too, if theyare bitten by the teeth of animals.</p><p>Varro<span id="ref_42"><a href="#note_42">[42]</a></span> informs us, too, as we have already stated,<span id="ref_43"><a href="#note_43">[43]</a></span> that theolive, if only licked by a she-goat, will be barren.<span id="ref_44"><a href="#note_44">[44]</a></span> Whenthus injured, some trees will die, while in others the fruit becomes deteriorated, the almond,<span id="ref_45"><a href="#note_45">[45]</a></span> for instance, the fruit of whichchanges from sweet to bitter. In other cases, again, the tree isimproved<span id="ref_46"><a href="#note_46">[46]</a></span> even—such, for instance, as the pear known in Chiosas the Phocian pear. We have already mentioned<span id="ref_47"><a href="#note_47">[47]</a></span> certaintrees, also, that are all the better for having the tops removed.Most trees perish when the trunk is split; but we must exceptthe vine, the apple, the fig, and the pomegranate. Others,again, will die if only a wound is inflicted: the fig, however,as well as all the resinous trees, is proof against such injury.It is far from surprising that, when the roots of a tree are cut,death should be the result; most of them perish, however,when, not all the roots, but only the larger ones, and thosewhich are more essential to life, have been severed.</p><p>Trees, too, will kill one another<span id="ref_48"><a href="#note_48">[48]</a></span> by their shade, or thedensity of their foliage, as also by the withdrawal of nourishment. Ivy,<span id="ref_49"><a href="#note_49">[49]</a></span> by clinging to a tree, will strangle<span id="ref_50"><a href="#note_50">[50]</a></span> it. Themistletoe, too, is far from beneficial, and the cytisus is killedby the plant to which the Greeks have given the name ofhalimon.<span id="ref_51"><a href="#note_51">[51]</a></span> It is the nature of some plants not to kill, but toinjure, by the odour they emit, or by the admixture of theirjuices; such is the influence exercised by the radish and thelaurel upon the vine.<span id="ref_52"><a href="#note_52">[52]</a></span> For the vine may reasonably be looked<pb n="3526" />upon as possessed of the sense of smell, and affected by odoursin a singular degree; hence, when it is near a noxious exhalation, it will turn away and withdraw from it. It was fromhis observation of this fact that Androcydes borrowed theradish<span id="ref_53"><a href="#note_53">[53]</a></span> as his antidote for drunkenness, recommending it tobe eaten on such occasions. The vine, too, abhors all coleworts and garden herbs, and the hazel<span id="ref_54"><a href="#note_54">[54]</a></span> as well; indeed it willbecome weak and ailing if they are not removed to a distancefrom it. Nitre, alum, warm sea-water, and the shells of beans<span id="ref_55"><a href="#note_55">[55]</a></span>and fitches act as poisons on the vine.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. xiii. c. 6.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. xiii. c. 47.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is the opinion of Theophrastus, Hist.
