The name given to these stalks is "cactos," and theyare not disliked as an article of food,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> even when old. Theplant, however, has one stem which grows upright, and isknown by the name of "pternix;" it has the same sweetflavour as the other parts, though it will not keep. The seedof it is covered with a kind of down, known as "pappus:"<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>when this is removed, as well as the rind<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> of the fruit, it istender, and like the pith of the palm: the name given to it is"ascalias."<pb n="4355" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is not the Cactus of modern botany, a plant mentioned in thesequel under the name of "Opuntia," but probably the Cinara cardun-cellus.
