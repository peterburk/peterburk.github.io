There are two kinds of it,the male and the female.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> The latter kind is the more approvedof, the male<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> stimmi being more uneven, rougher tothe touch, less ponderous, not so radiant, and more gritty.The female kind, on the other hand, is bright and friable, andseparates in laminæ, and not in globules.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He is speaking of Antimony.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From its whiteness.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Under the name of "female stimmi," Ajasson thinks that pure, ornative, antimony is meant, more particularly the lamelliform variety, remarkablefor its smoothness.
