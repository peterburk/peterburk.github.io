Still, however, this last distinctionwas introduced at a later period only, and we find itstated by writers that the public heralds<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> even were formerlyin the habit of wearing the tunic with the purple laticlave;the father of Lucius Ælius Stilo,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> for instance, from whomhis son received the cognomen of "Præconinus," in consequenceof his father's occupation as a herald. But the use ofrings, no doubt, was the distinguishing mark of a third andintermediate order, between the plebeians and the senators;and the title of "eques," originally derived from the possessionof a war-horse,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> is given at the present day as an indicationof a certain amount of income. This, however, is ofcomparatively recent introduction; for when the late EmperorAugustus made his regulations for the decuries,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> the greaterpart of the members thereof were persons who wore iron rings,and these bore the name, not of "equites," but of "judices,"<pb n="6083" />the former name being reserved solely for the members of thesquadrons<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> furnished with war-horses at the public charge.</p><p>Of these judices, too, there were at first but four<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> decuriesonly, and in each of these decuries there was hardly one thousandmen to be found, the provinces not having been hithertoadmitted to the office; an observance which is still in force atthe present day, no one newly admitted to the rights of citizenshipbeing allowed to perform the duties of judex as a memberof the decuries.</p><p>(2.) These decuries, too, were themselves distinguished byseveral denominations—" tribunes<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> of the treasury," "selecti,"<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>and "judices:" in addition to whom, there were the personsstyled the "nine hundred,"<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> chosen from all the decuries forthe purpose of keeping the voting-boxes at the comitia. Fromthe ambitious adoption, however, of some one of these names,great divisions ensued in this order, one person styling himselfa member of the nine hundred, another one of the selecti, anda third a tribune of the treasury.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The laticlave tunic.
