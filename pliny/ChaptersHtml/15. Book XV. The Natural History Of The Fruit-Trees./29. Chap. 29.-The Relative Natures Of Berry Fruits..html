First of all, among the grapes, we find considerabledifference in respect to their firmness, the thinness or thickness of the skin, and the stone inside the fruit, which in somevarieties is remarkably small, and in others even double innumber: these last producing but very little juice. Very different, again, are the berries of the ivy<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and the elder;<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> asalso those in the pomegranate,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> these being the only ones thatare of an angular shape. These last, also, have not a membrane for each individual grain, but one to cover them all incommon, and of a pale colour. All these fruits consist, too,of juice and flesh, and those more particularly which have butsmall seeds inside.</p><p>There are great varieties, too, among the berry<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> fruits;the berry of the olive being quite different from that of thelaurel, the berry of the lotus<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> from that of the cornel, andthat of the myrtle from the berry of the lentisk. The berry,however, of the aquifolium<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> and the thorn<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> is quite destituteof juice.</p><p>The cherry<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> occupies a middle place between the berry andthe acinus fruit: it is white at first, which is the case also<pb n="3322" />with nearly all the berries. From white, some of the berriespass to green, the olive and the laurel, for instance; while inthe mulberry, the cherry, and the cornel, the change is to red;and then in some to black, as with the mulberry, the cherry,and the olive, for instance.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xvi. c. 52.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxiv. c. 35.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xiii. c. 34.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Baccis."
