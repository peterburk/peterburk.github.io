It is at Gelduba,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> a fortress situate on thebanks of the Rhenus, that the finest are grown; from whichit would appear that they thrive best in a cold climate.There is a string running through the whole length of theskirret, and which is drawn out after it is boiled; but still,for all this, a considerable proportion of its natural pungency<pb n="4167" />is retained; indeed, when modified by the addition of honiedwine, this is even thought to impart to dishes an additionalrelish. The larger parsnip has also a similar sting inside, butonly when it is a year old. The proper time for sowing theskirret is in the months of February, March, April, August,September, and October.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Siser."
