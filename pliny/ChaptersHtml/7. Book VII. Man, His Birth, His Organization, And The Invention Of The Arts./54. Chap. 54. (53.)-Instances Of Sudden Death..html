(53.)—INSTANCES OF SUDDEN DEATH.</head><p>Among the things that are looked upon as more especiallysingular, though of frequent occurrence, is sudden death, a thingthat, in fact, is the greatest happiness of life, and, as we willshew, only a natural occurrence. Verrius has given many instances of it; we will limit ourselves by only making a selection. Besides Chilo, who has been already mentioned,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> Sophocles,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and Dionysius,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> the tyrant of Sicily, both of them, died<pb n="2214" />of joy, on learning that they had obtained the prize for tragedy.After the defeat at Cannæ, a mother died of joy, on seeing thather son had returned in safety, she having heard a false report of his death.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> Diodorus, the professor of logic,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> died ofmortification, because he could not immediately answer somequestion which had been put to him by Stilpo, by way ofjoke.</p><p>Two of the Cæsars,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> one of whom was at the time prætor,and the other had previously discharged that office, and wasthe father of the Dictator Cæsar, died without any apparentcause, in the morning, while putting on their shoes; the formerat Pisæ, the latter at Rome. Quintus Fabius Maximus diedduring his consulship, on the day before the calends of January,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>and in his place C. Rebilus got himself elected consul for only afew hours.<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> The same thing happened also to the senator,C. Volcatius Gurges; these were all of them so well, and insuch perfect health, that they were actually preparing to gofrom home. Q. Æmilius Lepidus,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> just as he was leaving hishouse, struck his great toe against the threshold of his chamberdoor. C. Aufustius, having gone from home, was proceedingto the senate-house, when he stumbled in the Comitium,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> andexpired. Their ambassador, who had just been pleading thecause of the Rhodians in the senate, to the admiration of every<pb n="2215" />one, suddenly expired at the door of the senate-house, just ashe was about to retire. Cn. Bæbius Tamphilus,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> who hadbeen prætor also, expired while he was enquiring of a boy<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>what time it was: Aulus Pompeius<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> died just after salutingthe gods in the Capitol; and M. Juventius Thalna,<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> the consul,while he was sacrificing. C. Servilius Pansa expired at thesecond hour of the day,<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> while he was standing in the Forum,near a shop there,<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> and leaning on the arm of his brother,Publius Pansa: the judge Bæbius, while he was giving anorder for an enlargement of bail:<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> M. Terentius Corax, whilehe was making an entry in his note-book in the Forum: onlylast year too, a member of the equestrian order at Rome,while whispering in the ear of a man of consular rank, beforethe ivory Apollo, in the Forum<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> of Augustus;<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> and, what ismore singular than all, C. Julius, the physician, while he wasapplying, with his probe,<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> some ointment to the eye of a patient. Aulus Manlius Torquatus, a man of consular rank, diedin the act of reaching a cake at dinner; L. Tuscius Valla, thephysician, while he was taking a draught of honeyed wine;<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span><pb n="2216" />Ap. Saufeius, while, on his return from the bath, after drinkingsome honeyed wine and water, he was swallowing an egg:P. Quinctius Scapula, while he was dining with AquiliusGallus: Decimus Saufeius, the scribe, while he was breakfasting at his house. Corn. Gallus,<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> who had filled the office ofPrætor, and Titus Haterius,<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span> a man of equestrian rank,died in the venereal act; and, a thing that was especially remarked by those of our day, two members of the equestrianorder expired in the embraces of the same actor of pantomimes,Mysticus by name, who was remarkable for his singularbeauty.</p><p>But the most perfect state, to all appearance, of securityfrom death, was that of which we have an account given bythe ancients, in the case of M. Ofilius Hilarus. He was anactor, and after having been very greatly applauded by thepeople, was giving, on his birthday, an entertainment. Duringdinner he called for a cup of warm drink; at the same time,looking at the masque which he had worn during the day,he placed upon it the chaplet,<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span> which he had taken from hisown head; and in that position he remained rigidly fixed,without moving, no one being aware of what had taken place,until the person who was reclining next to him reminded himthat the drink was getting cold; upon which he was found tobe dead.</p><p>These are instances of persons dying a happy death;<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span> but,<pb n="2217" />on the other hand, there are innumerable cases also of unfortunate ends. L. Domitius,<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span> a member of a most illustrious family,having been conquered at Massilia by Cæsar, and taken prisonerby him at Corfinium, being weary of life, took poison; but, immediately after, he used every possible exertion to prolong hislife. We find it stated in our Annals, that Felix, a charioteerof the red party,<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span> being placed on the funeral pile, some oneof the number of his admirers threw himself upon the pile; amost silly piece of conduct. Lest, however, this circumstancemight be attributed to the great excellence of the dead manin his art, and so redound to his glory, the other parties alldeclared that he had been overpowered by the strength of theperfumes. Not long ago, M. Lepidus, a man of very noblebirth, who died, as I have stated above,<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span> of chagrin caused byhis divorce, was hurled from the funeral pile by the violenceof the flames, and in consequence of the heat, could not be replaced upon it; in consequence of which, his naked body wasburnt with some other pieces of brushwood, in the vicinity ofthe pile.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In the twenty-third Chapter of the present Book.—B.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Val.

Theproportions were four measures of wine to one of honey; and various perfumes and spices were added. See B. xxii, c. 4.
