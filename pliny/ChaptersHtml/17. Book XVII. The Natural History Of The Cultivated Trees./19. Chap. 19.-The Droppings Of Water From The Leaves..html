<div2 type="chapter" n="19" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 19.—THE DROPPINGS OF WATER FROM THE LEAVES.</head><p>A very few words will suffice for the water that drops fromthe leaves of trees. In all those which are protected by afoliage so dense that the rain will not pass through, the dropsare of a noxious nature.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> In our enquiries, therefore, intothis subject it will be of the greatest consequence what willbe the nature developed by each tree in the soil in which weare intending to plant it. Declivities, taken by themselves,require smaller<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> intervals between the trees, and in localitiesthat are exposed to the wind it is beneficial to plant themcloser together. However, it is the olive that requires thelargest intervals to be left, and on this point it is the opinionof Cato,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> with reference to Italy, that the very smallest interval ought to be twenty-five feet, and the largest thirty:this, however, varies according to the nature of the site. Theolive is the largest<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> of all the trees in Bætica: and in Africa—if, indeed, we may believe the authors who say so—thereare many olive-trees that are known by the name of milliariæ,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span><pb n="3475" />being so called from the weight of oil that they produce eachyear. Hence it is that Mago has prescribed an interval between these trees of no less than seventy-five feet every way,or of forty-five at the very lowest, when the soil happens to bemeagre, hard, and exposed to the winds. There is no doubt,however, that Bætica reaps the most prolific harvests frombetween her olives.</p><p>It will be generally agreed that it is a most disgracefulpiece of ignorance to lop away the branches more than is absolutely necessary in trees of vigorous growth, and so precipitate old age; as also, on the other hand, what is generally tantamount to an avowal of unskilfulness on the part of thosewho have planted them, to have to cut them down altogether.Nothing can reflect greater disgrace upon agriculturists thanto have to undo what they have done, and it is therefore muchthe best to commit an error in leaving a superfluity of room.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is quite a fallacy. Even in the much more probable cases ofthe upas and mangineel, it is not the fact.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Theophrastus, De Causis, B. iii. c. 8, says, that trees that grow ondeclivities have shorter branches than those of the same kind growing onplains.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">De Re Rust. c. 16.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This assertion is doubtful; at the present day, in Andalusia, thepalm, the poplar, and many other trees are much larger than the olive.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Thousand pounders." This, as Fée remarks, is clearly an exaggeration.</p></body>
