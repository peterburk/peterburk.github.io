(11.)—THE COASTS OF ARABIA, SITUATE ON THE EGYPTIAN SEA.</head><p>Beyond the Pelusiac Mouth is Arabia<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>, which extends tothe Red Sea, and joins the Arabia known by the surname ofHappy<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>, so famous for its perfumes and its wealth. This<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>is called Arabia of the Catabanes<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, the Esbonitæ<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>, and theScenitæ<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>; it is remarkable for its sterility, except in the partswhere it joins up to Syria, and it has nothing remarkablein it except Mount Casius<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>. The Arabian nations of theCanchlæi<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> join these on the east, and, on the south theCedrei<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>, both of which peoples are adjoining to the Nabatæi<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>.The two gulfs of the Red Sea, where it borders upon<pb n="1423" />Egypt, are called the Heroöpolitic<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> and the Ælanitic<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>. Betweenthe two towns of Ælana<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> and Gaza<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> upon our sea<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>there is a distance of 150 miles. Agrippa says that Arsinoë<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span>,a town on the Red Sea, is, by way of the desert, 125 milesfrom Pelusium. How different the characteristics impressedby nature upon two places separated by so small a distance!</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Arabia Petræa; that part of Arabia which immediately joins up to Egypt.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Called Arabia Felix to the present day.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The part of Arabia which joins up to Egypt, Arabia Petræa namely.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Strabo places this people as far south as the mouth of the Red Sea, <hi rend="ital">i.e.</hi> on the east of the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb. Forster (in his 'Arabia,' vol. ii.) takes this name to be merely an inversion of Beni Kahtan, the great tribe which mainly peoples, at the present day, central and southern Arabia.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably the people of Esebon, the Heshbon of Scripture, spoken of by Jerome as being the city of Sihon, king of the Amorites.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The "tent-people," from the Greek <foreign lang="greek">skhnh\,</foreign> "a tent."

Forster identifies them with the Cauraitæ, or Cadraitæ of Arrian, and the Darræ of Ptolemy, tracing their origin to the Cedar or Kedar, the son of Ishmael, mentioned in Genesis xxv. 13, and represented by the modern Harb nation and the modern town of Kedeyre. See Psalm cxx. 5: "Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech, that I dwell in the tents of Kedar!"</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">An Arabian people, said to have descended from the eldest son of Ishmael, who had their original abodes in the north-western part of the Arabian peninsula, east and south-east of the Moabites and Edomites. Extending their territory, we find the Nabatæi of Greek and Roman history occupying nearly the whole of Arabia Petræa, along the northeast coast of the Red Sea, on both sides of the Ælanitic Gulf, and on the Idumæan mountains, where they had their capital, Petra, hewn out of the rock.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now the Bahr-el-Soueys, or Gulf of Suez.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Bahr-el-Akabah, or Gulf of Akabah.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Akabah, an Idumæan town of Arabia Petræa, situate at the head of the eastern gulf of the Red Sea, which was called after this town "Ælaniticus Sinus." It was annexed to the kingdom of Judah, with the other cities of Idumæa, by David, 2 Sam. viii. 14, and was one of the harbours on the Red Sea from which the ships of Solomon sailed for Ophir. See 1 Kings ix. 26 and 2 Chron. viii. 17. It was a place of commercial importance under the Romans and the head-quarters of the Tenth Legion. A fortress now occupies its site.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Its site is now known as Guzzah. It was the last city on the south-west frontier of Palestine, and from the earliest times was a strongly fortified place. It was taken from the Philistines by the Jews more than once, but as often retaken. It was also taken by Cyrus the Great and Alexander, and afterwards by Ptolemy Lagus, who destroyed it. It afterwards recovered, and was again destroyed by Alexander Jannæus, B.C. <date value="-96" authname="-96">96</date>, after which, it was rebuilt by Gabinius and ultimately united to the Roman province of Syria.
