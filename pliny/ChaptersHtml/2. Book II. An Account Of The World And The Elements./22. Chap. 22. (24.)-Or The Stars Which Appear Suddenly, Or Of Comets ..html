<div2 type="chapter" n="22" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 22. (24.)ÑOR THE STARS WHICH APPEAR SUDDENLY,OR OF COMETS<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>.</head><p>A few things still remain to be said concerning the world;for stars are suddenly formed in the heavens themselves; ofthese there are various kinds.</p><p>(25.) The Greeks name these stars <hi rend="ital">comets</hi><span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>; we name themCrinit¾, as if shaggy with bloody locks, and surrounded withbristles like hair. Those stars, which have a mane hangingdown from their lower part, like a long beard, are namedPogoni¾<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>. Those that are named Aconti¾<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> vibrate like a dartwith a very quick motion. It was one of this kind which theEmperor Titus described in his very excellent poem, ashaving been seen in his fifth consulship; and this was thelast of these bodies which has been observed. When theyare short and pointed they are named Xiphi¾<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>; these are the<pb n="1056" />pale kind; they shine like a sword and are without any rays;while we name those Discei<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>, which, being of an amber colour,in conformity with their name, emit a few rays from theirmargin only. A kind named Pitheus<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> exhibits the figure ofa cask, appearing convex and emitting a smoky light. Thekind named Cerastias<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> has the appearance of a horn; it islike the one which was visible when the Greeks fought atSalamis. Lampadias<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> is like a burning torch; Hippias<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> islike a horse's mane; it has a very rapid motion, like a circlerevolving on itself. There is also a white comet, with silverhair, so brilliant that it can scarcely be looked at, exhibiting,as it were, the aspect of the Deity in a human form. Thereare some also that are shaggy, having the appearance of afleece, surrounded by a kind of crown. There was one,where the appearance of a mane was changed into that of aspear; it happened in the 109th olympiad, in the 398th yearof the City<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>. The shortest time during which any one ofthem has been observed to be visible is 7 days, the longest180 days.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We may remark, that our author, for the most part, adopts theopinions of Aristotle respecting comets and meteors of all kinds, while hepays but little attention to those of his contemporary Seneca, which however, on some points, would appear to be more correct. See the remarksof Marcus in Ajasson, ii. 244. Under the title of comets he includes, notonly those bodies which are permanent and move in regular orbits, butsuch as are transient, and are produced from various causes, the nature ofwhich is not well understood. See Aristotle, Meteor. lib. i. cap. 6, 7,and Seneca, Nat. Qu¾st. lib. 7, and Manilius, i. 807 <hi rend="ital">et seq.</hi></p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">a <foreign lang="greek">ko/mh,</foreign> coma.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">a <foreign lang="greek">pwgwni/os,</foreign> barbatus.

Lemaire, i. 295.According to the most approved modern chronology, the middle of the109th olympiad corresponds to the 211th year of the City.</p></body>
