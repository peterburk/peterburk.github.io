<div2 type="chapter" n="33" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 33. (9.)—REMEDIES FURNISHED IN COMMON BY ANIMALSOF THE SAME CLASS, WHETHER WILD OR TAME. FIFTY-FOURMEDICINAL USES OF MILK, WITH OBSERVATIONS THEREON.</head><p>We will now return to our own part of the world, speaking,first of all, of certain remedies common to animals in general,but excellent in their nature; such as the use of milk, forexample. The most beneficial milk to every creature is themother's<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> milk. It is highly dangerous for nursing women to<pb n="5320" />conceive: children that are suckled by them are known amongus as "colostrati,"<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> their milk being thick, like cheese in appearance—the name "colostra,"<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> it should be remembered, isgiven to the first milk secreted after delivery, which assumes aspongy, coagulated form. The most nutritive milk, in allcases, is woman's milk, and next to that goats' milk, to whichis owing, probably, the fabulous story that Jupiter was suckledby a goat.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> The sweetest, next to woman's milk, is camels'milk; but the most efficacious, medicinally speaking, is asses'milk. It is in animals of the largest size and individualsof the greatest bulk, that the milk is secreted with the greatestfacility. Goats' milk agrees the best with the stomach, thatanimal browsing more than grazing. Cows' milk is consideredmore medicinal, while ewes' milk is sweeter and more nutritive, but not so well adapted to the stomach, it being moreoleaginous than any other.</p><p>Every kind of milk is more aqueous in spring than in summer, and the same in all cases where the animal has grazedupon a new pasture. The best milk of all is that which adheresto the finger nail, when placed there, and does not run from offit. Milk is most harmless when boiled, more particularly ifsea pebbles<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> have been boiled with it. Cows' milk is the mostrelaxing, and all kinds of milk are less apt to inflate whenboiled. Milk is used for all kinds of internal ulcerations,those of the kidneys, bladder, intestines, throat, and lungs inparticular; and externally, it is employed for itching sensationsupon the skin, and for purulent eruptions, it being taken fastingfor the purpose. We have already<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> stated, when speaking ofthe plants, how that in Arcadia cows' milk is administered forphthisis, consumption, and cachexy. Instances are cited, also,of persons who have been cured of gout in the hands and feet,by drinking asses' milk.</p><p>To these various kinds of' milk, medical men have addedanother, to which they have given the name of "schiston;"<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span><pb n="5321" />the following being the usual method of preparing it. Goats'milk, which is used in preference for the purpose, is boiled ina new earthen vessel, and stirred with branches of a fig-treenewly gathered, as many cyathi of honied wine being added toit as there are semisextarii of milk. When the mixture boils,care is taken to prevent it running over, by plunging into it asilver cyathus measure filled with cold water, none of the waterbeing allowed to escape. When taken off the fire, the constituent parts of it divide as it cools, and the whey is thus separatedfrom the milk. Some persons, again, take this whey, which isnow very strongly impregnated with wine, and, after boilingit down to one third, leave it to cool in the open air. Thebest way of taking it, is in doses of one semisextarius, at statedintervals, during five consecutive days; after taking it, ridingexercise should be used by the patient. This whey is admi-nistered in cases of epilepsy, melancholy, paralysis, leprosy,elephantiasis, and diseases of the joints.</p><p>Milk is employed as an injection where excoriations havebeen caused by the use of strong purgatives; in cases alsowhere dysentery is productive of chafing, it is similarly employed, boiled with sea pebbles or a ptisan of barley. Where,however, the intestines are excoriated, cows' milk or ewes'milk is the best. New milk is used as an injection for dysentery; and in an unboiled state, it is employed for affections ofthe colon and uterus, and for injuries inflicted by serpents. Itis also taken internally as an antidote to the venom of cantharides, the pine-caterpillar, the buprestis, and the salamander.Cows' milk is particularly recommended for persons who havetaken colchicum, hemlock, dorycnium,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> or the flesh of the seahare; and asses' milk, in cases where gypsum, white-lead,sulphur,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> or quick-silver, have been taken internally. Thislast is good too for constipation attendant upon fever, and isremarkably useful as a gargle for ulcerations of the throat. Itis taken, also, internally, by patients suffering from atrophy, forthe purpose of recruiting their exhausted strength; as also incases of fever unattended with head-ache. The ancients heldit as one of their grand secrets, to administer to children, beforetaking food, a semisextarius of asses' milk, or for want of that,goats' milk; a similar dose, too, was given to children troubled<pb n="5322" />with chafing of the rectum at stool. It is considered a sovereign remedy for hardness of breathing, to take cows' milkwhey, mixed with nasturtium. In cases of ophthalmia, too, theeyes are fomented with a mixture of one semisextarius ofmilk and four drachmæ of pounded sesame.</p><p>Goats' milk is a cure for diseases of the spleen; but in suchcase the goats must fast a couple of days, and be fed on ivyleaves the third; the patient, too, must drink the milk for threeconsecutive days, without taking any other nutriment. Milk,under other circumstances, is detrimental to persons sufferingfrom head-ache, liver complaints, diseases of the spleen, andaffections of the sinews; it is bad for fevers, also, vertigo—except, indeed, where it is required as a purgative—-oppression ofthe head, coughs, and ophthalmia. Sows' milk is extremely use-ful in cases of tenesmus, dysentery, and phthisis; authors havebeen found too, to assert that it is very wholesome for females.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Except, of course, when the mother is in a state of disease.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xi. c. 96.
