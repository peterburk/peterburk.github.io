In onemine, and that only, the one known as the mine of Albucrara,in Gallæcia,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> the proportion of silver is but one thirty-sixth:hence it is that the ore of this mine is so much more valuablethan that of others. Whenever the proportion of silver is one-fifth,the ore is known also by the name of "electrum;"<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> grains,too, of this metal are often found in the gold known as "canaliense."<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>An artificial<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> electrum, too, is made, by mixingsilver with gold. If the proportion of silver exceeds one-fifth,the metal offers no resistance on the anvil.</p><p>Electrum, too, was highly esteemed in ancient times, as welearn from the testimony of Homer, who represents<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> the palaceof Menelaüs as refulgent with gold and electrum, silver andivory. At Lindos, in the island of Rhodes, there is a templededicated to Minerva, in which there is a goblet of electrum,consecrated by Helena: history states also that it was mouldedafter the proportions of her bosom. One peculiar advantageof electrum is, its superior brilliancy to silver by lamp-light.Native electrum has also the property of detecting poisons;for in such case, semicircles, resembling the rainbow in appearance,will form upon the surface of the goblet, and emit acrackling noise, like that of flame, thus giving a twofold indicationof the presence of poison.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is almost, but not quite, universally the case.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In Spain.
