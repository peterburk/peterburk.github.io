<div2 type="chapter" n="30" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 30.ÑMOLAR STONES. PYRITES; SEVEN REMEDIES.</head><p>In no country are the molar stones<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> superior to those ofItaly; stones, be it remembered, and not fragments of rock:there are some provinces, too, where they are not to be foundat all. Some stones of this class are softer than others, andadmit of being smoothed with the whetstone, so as to presentall the appearance, at a distance, of ophites.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> There is nostone of a more durable nature than this; for in general, stone,like wood, suffers from the action, more or less, of rain, heat,and cold. Some kinds, again, become deteriorated by the actionof the moon, while others are apt to contract a rust in lapse oftime, or to change their white colour when steeped in oil.</p><p>(19.) Some persons give this molar stone the name of"pyrites,"<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> from the circumstance that it has a great affinityto fire;<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> but there is also another kind of pyrites, of a moreporous nature, and another,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> again, which resembles copper.This last, it is said, is found in the mines, near Acamas,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> in theIsle of Cyprus; one variety of it being of a silver, another of agolden, colour. There are various methods of melting thesestones, some persons fusing them twice, or three times even, inhoney, till all the liquid has evaporated; while others, again,calcine them upon hot coals, and, after treating them withhoney, wash them like copper.</p><p>The medicinal properties which these minerals possess are ofa calorific, desiccative, dispersive, and resolvent nature, and,<pb n="6360" />applied topically, they cause indurations to suppurate. Theyare employed also, in a crude state and pulverized, for thecure of scrofulous sores and boils. Some writers mentionanother kind of pyrites also. Those among them have thegreatest affinity to fire which we distinguish as "live"<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>pyrites. They are the most ponderous of all, and are foundremarkably useful for advance-guards when laying out encampments;for, on being struck with a nail or any other kind of stone,they emit a spark, which, received upon sulphur, dried fungus,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>or leaves, produces a fire almost sooner than it could be named.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Molares."
