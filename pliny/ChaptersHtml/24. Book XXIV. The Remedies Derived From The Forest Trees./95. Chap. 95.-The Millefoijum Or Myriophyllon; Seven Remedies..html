It grows in marshy localities, and is remarkably useful for the treatment of wounds.It is taken in vinegar for strangury, affections of the bladder,asthma, and falls with violence; it is extremely efficacious alsofor tooth-ache.</p><p>In Etruria, the same name is given to a small meadow-plant,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> provided with leaves at the sides, like hairs, and particularly useful for wounds. The people of that country saythat, applied with axle-grease, it will knit together and unitethe tendons of oxen, when they have been accidentally severedby the plough-share.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "ten thousand leaves."
