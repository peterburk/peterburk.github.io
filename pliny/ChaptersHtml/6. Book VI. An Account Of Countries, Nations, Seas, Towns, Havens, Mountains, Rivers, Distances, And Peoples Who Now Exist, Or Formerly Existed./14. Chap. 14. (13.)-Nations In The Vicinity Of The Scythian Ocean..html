<div2 type="chapter" n="14" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 14. (13.)—NATIONS IN THE VICINITY OF THE SCYTHIAN OCEAN.</head><p>Having now stated all that bears reference to the interiorof Asia, let us cross in imagination the Riphæan<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> Mountains,and traverse the shores of the ocean to the right. On threesides does this ocean wash the coasts of Asia, as the ScythianOcean on the north, the Eastern Ocean on the east, and theIndian Ocean on the south; and it is again divided intovarious names, derived from the numerous gulfs which itforms, and the nations which dwell upon its shores. A greatpart of Asia, however, which lies exposed to the north,through the noxious effects of those freezing climates, consists of nothing but vast deserts. From the extreme north northeast to the point<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> where the sun rises in the summer, it isthe country of the Scythians. Still further than them, andbeyond<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> the point where north north-east begins, some writershave placed the Hyperborei, who are said, indeed, by themajority to be a people of Europe.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> After passing this point,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span><pb n="2024" />the first place that is known is Lytarmis,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> a promontory ofCeltica, and next to it the river Carambucis,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> where the chainof the Riphæan Mountains terminates, and with it the extremerigour of the climate; here, too, we have heard of a certainpeople being situate, called the Arimphæi,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> a race not muchunlike the Hyperborei.<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> Their habitations are the groves, andthe berries their diet; long hair is held to be disgraceful by thewomen as well as the men, and they are mild in their manners.Hence it is that they are reported to be a sacred<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> race, andare never molested even by the savage tribes which borderupon them, and not only they, but such other persons as wellas may have fled to them for refuge. Beyond these wecome straight to the Scythians, the Cimmerii, the Cisianthi,the Georgi, and a nation of Amazons.<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>These last extendto the Caspian and Hyrcanian Sea.<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is difficult to say what chain of mountains, if indeed any in particular,he would designate by this name. Parisot remarks that these mountainswould seem to belong rather to the region of poetry and fable than of fact,and states that it is pretty clear that the Balkan chain, the districts inwhich the Danube takes its rise, the Alps, the Pyrenees, the Hercynianmountains, and even the chain of Taurus and Caucasus, have at differenttimes been described or mentioned under the name of Riphæan Mountains.It was evidently Pliny's belief that the great Northern or Scythian Oceanskirted the northern shores of Asia, a little above the latitude perhapsof the northern extremity of the Caspian. In B. iv. c. 26, we find himcrossing these, perhaps imaginary, mountains, and then proceeding to theleft, along, as he supposes, the extreme northern shores of Europe; herehe seems to start from the same point, but turns to the right, and proceedsalong the northern, eastern, and southern shores of Asia.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">North-east.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot"><hi rend="ital">I. e.</hi> more to the west.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. iv. c. 26.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The extremity of the supposed shores of the Hyperborei</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">D'Anville supposes that he means the headland called Cande-Noss orKanin-Noss, in the White Sea.
