<div2 type="chapter" n="57" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 57. (56.)—SHOWERS OF MILK, BLOOD, FLESH, IRON,WOOL, AND BAKED TILES<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>.</head><p>Besides these, we learn from certain monuments, that fromthe lower part of the atmosphere<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> it rained milk and blood,in the consulship of M'Acilius and C. Porcius, and frequentlyat other times<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>. This was the case with respect to flesh, inthe consulship of P. Volumnius and Servius Sulpicius, and itis said, that what was not devoured by the birds did not becomeputrid. It also rained iron among the Lucanians, theyear before Crassus was slain by the Parthians, as well as allthe Lucanian soldiers, of whom there was a great number inthis army. The substance which fell had very much the appearance ofsponge<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>; the augurs warned the people against<pb n="1088" />wounds that might come from above. In the consulship ofL. Paulus and C. Marcellus it rained wool, round the castleof Carissanum, near which place, a year after, T. Annius Milowas killed. It is recorded, among the transactions of thatyear, that when he was pleading his own cause, there was ashower of baked tiles.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There is strong evidence for the fact, that, at different times, varioussubstances have fallen from the atmosphere, sometimes apparently of mineral, and, at other times, of animal or vegetable origin. Some of theseare now referred to those peculiar bodies termed aërolites, the nature andsource of which are still doubtful, although their existence is no longerso. These bodies have, in other instances, been evidently discharged fromdistant volcanoes, but there are many cases where the substance could notbe supposed to have proceeded from a volcano, and where, in the presentstate of our knowledge, it appears impossible to offer an explanation oftheir nature, or the source whence they are derived. We may, however,conclude, that notwithstanding the actual occurrence of a few cases ofthis description, a great proportion of those enumerated by the ancientswere either entirely without foundation or much exaggerated. We meetwith several variations of what we may presume to have been aërolites inLivy; for example, xxiv. 10, xxx. 38, xli. 9, xliii. 13, and xliv. 18, amongmany others. As naturally may be expected, we have many narratives ofthis kind in Jul. Obsequens.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The same region from which lightning was supposed to proceed.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We have several relations of this kind in Livy, xxiv. 10, xxxix. 46 and56, xl. 19, and xliii. 13. The red snow which exists in certainalpine regions, and is found to depend upon the presence of the Uredonivalis, wasformerly attributed to showers of blood.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This occurrence may probably be referred to an aërolite, while thewool mentioned below, i.e. a light flocculent substance, was perhapsvolcanic.</p></body>
