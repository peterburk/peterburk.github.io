<div2 type="chapter" n="75" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 75.—THE DIFFERENT SHAPES OF SHEEP; THE MUSMON.</head><p>In the sheep, it is considered a proof of its being of a very<pb n="2339" />fair breed, when the legs are short, and the belly is coveredwith wool; when this part is bare, they used to be calledapicæ, and were looked upon as worthless.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> The tail of theSyrian sheep is a cubit in length,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and it is upon that partthat most of the wool is found. It is considered too early tocastrate lambs before they are five months old.(49.) There is in Spain, and more especially in Corsica, apeculiar kind of animal called the musmon,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> not very unlike asheep, but with a fleece which more resembles the hair of thegoat than the wool of the sheep. The ancients gave the nameof umbri<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> to the breed between this animal and the sheep.The head of the sheep is the weakest part of all, on whichaccount it is obliged, when it feeds, to turn away from thesun.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> The animals which are covered with wool are the moststupid of all.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> When they are afraid to enter any place, ifone is only dragged into it by the horns, all the rest willfollow. The longest duration of their life is ten years; but inÆthiopia it is thirteen. Goats live in that country elevenyears, but in other parts of the world mostly eight years only.Both of these animals require to be covered not more than fourtimes to ensure conception.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny probably took this from Varro, B. ii. c. 2. This term is derivedfrom <foreign lang="greek">pei/kw,</foreign> "to shear," with the negative prefix.—B.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The word "cubitales" alone is used, which might be supposed torefer only to the length of the tail; but Hardouin conceives that it mustalso apply to the breadth, and refers to Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c.28, and others, in proof of the great size which the tails of the Syriansheep attain, and which would not be indicated by merely saying that theyare a cubit long; this being little more than the ordinary length in othercountries.—B.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">According to Hardouin, this term, or some word nearly resembling it,was applied to mules or mongrels, as well as to individual animals of di-minutive size or less perfect form.—B. Called "moufflon" by the French.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The term "umbri" appears to have been applied to a mongrel or lessperfect animal; like "musmon," it is of uncertain derivation.—B.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">So also Varro, <hi rend="ital">ubi supra,</hi> and Columella, B. vii. c. 3.—B. See alsoB. xviii. c. 76.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This remark, and the others in the remainder of this Chapter, appearto be taken from Aristotle, list. Anim. B. ix. c. 3.—B.</p></body>
