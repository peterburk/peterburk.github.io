In the elm,too, the superfluous juices are drawn off, by piercing the treeabove ground to the pith when it is old, or when it is foundto suffer from an excess of nutriment. So, too, when the barkof the fig is turgid and swollen, the confined juices are discharged by means of light incisions made in a slanting direction; by the adoption of which method the fruit is preventedfrom falling off. When fruit-trees bud but bear no fruit, afissure is made in the root, and a stone inserted; the result ofwhich is, that they become productive.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> The same is donealso with the almond, a wedge of robur being employed forthe purpose. For the pear and the service tree a wedge oftorch-wood is used, and then covered over with ashes and earth.It is even found of use, too, to make circular incisions aroundthe roots of the vine and fig, when the vegetation is too luxuriant, and then to throw ashes over the roots. A late crop offigs is ensured, if the first fruit is taken off when green andlittle larger than a bean; for it is immediately succeeded byfresh, which ripens at a later period than usual. If the tops ofeach branch are removed from the fig, just as it is beginningto put forth leaves, its strength and productiveness are greatlyincreased. As to caprification, the effect of that is to ripen thefruit.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He alludes to the medical operation for the removal of carious bones,described by Celsus, B. viii. c. 3.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is still done by some persons; but it can be productive of nobeneficial result.</p></body>
