<div2 type="chapter" n="4" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 4.—THE ORIGIN OF THE PRESENTATION OF CROWNS.</head><p>In ancient times crowns<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> were presented to none but a<pb n="3343" />divinity, hence it is that Homer<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> awards them only to thegods of heaven and to the entire army; but never to an individual, however great his achievements in battle may havebeen. It is said, too, that Father Liber was the first of allwho placed a crown on his head, and that it was made of ivy.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>In succeeding times, those engaged in sacrifices in honour ofthe gods began to wear them, the victims being decked withwreaths as well. More recently, again, they were employedin the sacred games;<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and at the present day they are bestowed on such occasions, not upon the victor, indeed, butupon his country, which receives, it is proclaimed, this crown athis hands.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> Hence arose the usage of conferring wreaths uponwarriors when about to enjoy a triumph, for them to consecrate in the temples: after which it became the custom topresent them at our games. It would be a lengthy matter,and, indeed, foreign to the purpose of this work, to enter upona discussion who was the first Roman that received each kindof crown; in fact, they were acquainted with none but such aswere given as the reward of military prowess. It is a well-known fact, however, that this people has more varieties ofcrowns than those of all other nations put together.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Athenæus and Fabius Pictor say that Janus was the first wearer of acrown: Pherecydes says it was Saturn, Diodorus Siculus Jupiter, and LeoÆgyptiacus Isis, who wore one of wheat.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">II. xiii. 736.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See cc. 34 and 35 of the present Book.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Olympian, Pythian, Isthmian, and Nemæan games.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. vii. c. 27.</p></body>
