<div2 type="chapter" n="10" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 10. (10.)—THE MODE IN WHICH BEES WORK.</head><p>The manner in which bees carry on their work is as follows.In the day time a guard is stationed at the entrance of thehive, like the sentries in a camp. At night they take theirrest until the morning, when one of them awakes the rest witha humming noise, repeated twice or thrice, just as though it weresounding a trumpet. They then take their flight in a body,if the day is likely to turn out fine; for they have the gift offoreknowing wind and rain, and in such case will keep closewithin their dwellings. On the other hand, when the weather isfine—and this, too, they have the power of foreknowing—theswarm issues forth, and at once applies itself to its work, someloading their legs from the flowers, while others fill theirmouths with water, and charge the downy surface of theirbodies with drops of liquid. Those among them that areyoung<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> go forth to their labours, and collect the materialsalready mentioned, while those that are more aged stay withinthe hives and work. The bees whose business it is to carrythe flowers, with their fore feet load their thighs, which Naturehas made rough for the purpose, and with their trunks load<pb n="3009" />their fore feet: bending beneath their load, they then returnto the hive, where there are three or four bees ready to receivethem and aid in discharging their burdens. For, within thehive as well, they have their allotted duties to perform: someare engaged in building, others in smoothing, the combs, whileothers again are occupied in passing on the materials, andothers in preparing food<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> from the provision which has beenbrought; that there may be no unequal division, either in theirlabour, their food, or the distribution of their time, they do noteven feed separately.</p><p>Commencing at the vaulted roof of the hive, they beginthe construction of their cells, and, just as we do in the manufacture of a web, they construct their cells from top to bottom,taking care to leave two passages around each compartment,for the entrance of some and the exit of others. The combs,which are fastened to the hive in the upper part, and in aslight degree also at the sides, adhere to each other, and arethus suspended altogether. They do not touch the floor of thehive, and are either angular or round, according to its shape;sometimes, in fact, they are both angular and round at once,when two swarms are living in unison, but have dissimilarmodes of operation. They prop up the combs that are likelyto fall, by means of arched pillars, at intervals springing fromthe floor, so as to leave them a passage for the purpose ofeffecting repairs. The first three ranks of their cells are generally left empty when constructed, that there may be nothingexposed to view which may invite theft; and it is the lastones, more especially, that are filled with honey: henceit is that the combs are always taken out at the back of thehive.</p><p>The bees that are employed in carrying look out for a favourable breeze, and if a gale should happen to spring up, theypoise themselves in the air with little stones, by way of ballast; some writers, indeed, say that they place them upon theirshoulders. When the wind is contrary, they fly close to theground, taking care, however, to keep clear of the brambles.It is wonderful what strict watch is kept upon their work: allinstances of idleness are carefully remarked, the offenders are<pb n="3010" />chastised, and on a repetition of the fault, punished with death.Their sense of cleanliness, too, is quite extraordinary; everything is removed that might he in the way, and no filth isallowed to remain in the midst of their work. The ordureeven of those that are at work within, that they may not haveto retire to any distance, is all collected in one spot, and onstormy days, when they are obliged to cease their ordinarylabours, they employ themselves in carrying it out. Whenit grows towards evening, the buzzing in the hive becomesgradually less and less, until at last one of their number is tobe seen flying about the hive with the same loud hummingnoise with which they were aroused in the morning, thereby giving the signal, as it were, to retire to rest: in this, too,they imitate the usage of the camp. The moment the signalis heard, all is silent.</p><p>(11.) They first construct the dwellings of the commonalty,and then those of the king-bee. If they have reason to expectan abundant<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> season, they add abodes also for the drones:these are cells of a smaller size, though the drones themselvesare larger than the bees.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Huber has discovered that there are two kinds of bees of neutral sex,or, as he calls them, unprolific females, the workers, which go out, andthe nurses, which are smaller, and stay in the hive to tend the larvæ.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From the honey found in the corollæ of flowers.
