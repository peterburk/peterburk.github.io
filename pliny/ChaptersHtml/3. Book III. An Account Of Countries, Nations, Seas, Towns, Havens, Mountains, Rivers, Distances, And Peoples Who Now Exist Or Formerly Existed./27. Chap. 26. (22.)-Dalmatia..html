(22.)—DALMATIA.</head><p>Scardona, situate upon the river<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>, at a distance of twelvemiles from the sea, forms the boundary of Liburnia and thebeginning of Dalmatia. Next to this place comes the ancientcountry of the Autariatares and the fortress of Tariona, thePromontory of Diomedes<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>, or, as others call it, the peninsulaof Hyllis, 100 miles<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> in circuit. Then comes Tragurium, aplace with the rights of Roman citizens, and celebrated forits marble, Sicum, a place to which Claudius, the emperorlately deified, sent a colony of his veterans, and Salona<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, acolony, situate 112 miles from ladera. To this place resortfor legal purposes, having the laws dispensed according totheir divisions into decuries or tithings, the Dahmatæ, forming 342decuries, the Deurici 22, the Ditiones 239, theMazæi 269, and the Sardiates 52. In this region are Burnum<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>,Andetrium<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>, and Tribulium, fortresses ennobled bythe battles of the Roman people. To the same jurisdictionalso belong the Issæi<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>, the Colentini, the Separi, and the<pb n="1260" />Epetini, nations inhabiting the islands. After these comethe fortresses of Peguntium<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> and of Rataneum, with thecolony of Narona<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>, the seat of the third jurisdiction, distantfrom Salona eighty-two miles, and situate upon a river of thesame name, at a distance of twenty miles from the sea. M.Varro states that eighty-nine states used to resort thither, butnow nearly the only ones that are known are the Cerauni<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>with 24 decuries, the Daorizi with 17, the Dæsitiates with 103,the Docleatæ with 33, the Deretini with 14, the Deremistæwith 30, the Dindari with 33, the Glinditiones with 44, theMelcomani with 24, the Naresii with 102, the Scirtarii with72, the Siculotæ with 24, and the Vardæi, once the scourgesof Italy, with no more than 20 decuries. In addition tothese, this district was possessed by the Ozuæi, the Partheni,the Hemasini, the Arthitæ, and the Armistæ. The colonyof Epidaurum<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> is distant from the river Naron 100 miles.After Epidaurum come the following towns, with the rightsof Roman citizens:—Rhizinium<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>, Acruvium<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>, Butua,Olcinium, formerly called Colchinium, having been founded bythe Colchians; the river Drilo<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>, and, upon it, Scodra<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>, atown with the rights of Roman citizens, situate at a distanceof eighteen miles from the sea; besides in former times manyGreek towns and once powerful states, of which all remem-<pb n="1261" />brance is fast fading away. For in this region there wereformerly the Labeatæ, the Enderini<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span>, the Sasæi, theGrabæi<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span>,properly called Illyrii, the Taulantii<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span>, and the Pyrei. ThePromontory of Nymphæum on the sea-coast still retains itsname<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span>; and there is Lissum, a town enjoying the rights ofRoman citizens, at a distance from Epidaurum of 100 miles.</p><p>(23.) At Lissum begins the province of Macedonia<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span>, thenations of the Parthini<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span>, and behind them the Dassaretæ<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span>.The mountains of Candavia<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span> are seventy-eight miles fromDyrrhachium. On the coast lies Denda, a town with therights of Roman citizens, the colony of Epidamnum<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span>, which,on account of its inauspicious name, was by the Romanscalled Dyrrhachium, the river Aöus<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span>, by' some called Æas,and Apollonia<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span>, formerly a colony of the Corinthians, at adistance of four miles from the sea, in the vicinity of which<pb n="1262" />the celebrated Nymphæum<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span> is inhabited by the barbarousAmantes<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span> and Buliones. Upon the coast too is the town ofOricum<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span>, founded by the Colchians. At this spot beginsEpirus, with the Acroceraunian<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span> mountains, by which we havepreviously mentioned<span id="ref_31"><a href="#note_31">[31]</a></span> this Gulf of Europe as bounded.Oricum is distant from the Promontory of Salentinum inItaly eighty<span id="ref_32"><a href="#note_32">[32]</a></span> miles.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Titus or Kerka. Scardona still retains its name.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called the Cabo di San Nicolo.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This measurement would make it appear that the present Sabioncellois meant, but that it ought to come below, after Narona. He probablymeans the quasi peninsula upon which the town of Tragurium, now TrauVecchio, was situate; but its circumference is hardly fifty miles. So, ifSicum is the same as the modern Sebenico, it ought to have beenmentioned previously to Tragurium.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Spalatro, the retreat of Diocletian, was in the vicinity of Salona. Itsancient name was Spolatum, and at the village of Dioclea near it, thatemperor was born. On the ruins of the once important city of Salona,rose the modern Spalato or Spalatro.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Its site is unknown, though D'Anville thinks that it was probablythat of the modern Tain.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Clissa is supposed to occupy its site. Tribulium is probably themodern Ugliane.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The people of the island of Issa, now Lissa, off the coast ofLiburnia. It was originally peopled by a Parian or a Syracusancolony. Itwas famous for its wine, and the beaked ships "Lembi Issaici," renderedthe Romans good service in the war with Philip of Macedon.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The modern Almissa stands on its site; and on that of Rataneum,Mucarisca.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called Narenta; the river having the same name.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The localities of all these peoples are unknown.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or Epidaurus. It is not noticed in history till the civil war betweenPompey and Cæsar, when, having declared in favour of the latter, it wasbesieged by M. Octavius. The site of it is known as Ragusa Vecchia, orOld Ragusa, but in the Illyric language it is called Zaptal. Upon itsdestruction, its inhabitants moved to Rausium, the present Ragusa.There are no remains extant of the old town.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It still retains the name of Risine, upon the Golfo di Cattaro, theancient Sinus Rhizonicus.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In the former editions called "Ascrivium." The modern Cattaro issupposed to occupy its site. Butua is the modern Budua, and Olcinium,Dulcigno. It is probable that the derivation of the name of this lastplace, as suggested by Pliny, is only fanciful.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called Drin and Drino.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called Scutari or Scodar, the capital of the province called bythe Turks Sangiac de Scodar.</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">According to Hardouin, the modern Endero stands on the site oftheir capital.</p><p><span id="note_17"><a href="#ref_17">17. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Grabia, mentioned by Pouqueville, in his "Voyage de la Grece," seemsto retain the name of this tribe.</p><p><span id="note_18"><a href="#ref_18">18. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pouqueville is of opinion that they occupied the district now knownas Musaché.</p><p><span id="note_19"><a href="#ref_19">19. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Dalechamp thinks that the two words "Retinet nomen" do not belongto the text, but have crept in from being the gloss of some more recentcommentator. They certainly appear to be out of place. This promontoryis now called Cabo Rodoni.</p><p><span id="note_20"><a href="#ref_20">20. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The modern Albania.</p><p><span id="note_21"><a href="#ref_21">21. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pouqueville is of opinion that they inhabited the district about thepresent village of Presa, seven leagues N.E. of Durazzo.</p><p><span id="note_22"><a href="#ref_22">22. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From Ptolemy we learn that Lychnidus was their town; the site ofwhich, according to Pouqueville, is still pointed out at a spot about fourleagues south of Ochrida, on the eastern bank of the Lake of Ochrida.</p><p><span id="note_23"><a href="#ref_23">23. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called El Bassan; though Pouqueville says Tomoros or DeCaulonias. Commencing in Epirus, they separated Illyricum fromMacedonia. See Lucan's Pharsalia, B. vi. 1. 331.</p><p><span id="note_24"><a href="#ref_24">24. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Romans are said to have changed its Greek name Epidamnum,from an idea that it was inauspicious, as implying "damnum" or "ruin."It has been asserted that they gave it the name of Durrhachium orDyrrhachium, from "durum," rugged, on account of the ruggedness of itslocality. This however cannot be the case, as the word, like itspredecessor, is of Greek origin. Its unfortunate name, "Epidamnus,"is thesubject of several puns and witticisms in that most amusing perhaps of allthe plays of Plautus, the Menæchmi. It was of Corcyrean origin, andafter playing a distinguished part in the civil wars between Pompey andCæsar, was granted by Augustus to his veteran troops. The modernDurazzo stands on its site.</p><p><span id="note_25"><a href="#ref_25">25. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called the Voioussa.</p><p><span id="note_26"><a href="#ref_26">26. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The monastery of Pollina stands on its site. It was founded bythe Corinthians and Corcyreans. There are scarcely any vestiges of itremaining.</p><p><span id="note_27"><a href="#ref_27">27. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See further mention of this spot in B. ii. c. 110.</p><p><span id="note_28"><a href="#ref_28">28. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pouqueville states that the ruins of Amantia are to be seen near thevillage of Nivitza, on the right bank of the river Suchista. The remainsof Bullis, the chief town of the Buliones, according to the same traveller,are to be seen at a place called Gradista, four miles from the sea.</p><p><span id="note_29"><a href="#ref_29">29. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The same writer states that Oricum was situate on the present GulfDe la Vallona or d'Avlona, and that its port was the place now called bythe Greeks Porto Raguseo, and by the Turks Liman Padisha.</p><p><span id="note_30"><a href="#ref_30">30. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The "Heights of Thunder." They were so called from the frequentthunderstorms with which they were visited. The range howeverwas more properly called the "Ceraunii Montes," and the promontoryterminating it "Acroceraunii" or "Acroceraunia," meaning "the end ofthe Ceraunii." The range is now called the Mountains of Khimara, andthe promontory, Glossa, or in Italian, Linguetta, meaning "the Tongue."</p><p><span id="note_31"><a href="#ref_31">31. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In C. 15 of the present Book.</p><p><span id="note_32"><a href="#ref_32">32. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">About 70 English miles is the distance.</p></body>
