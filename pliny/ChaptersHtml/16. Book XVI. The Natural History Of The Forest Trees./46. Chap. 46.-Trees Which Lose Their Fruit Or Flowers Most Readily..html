<div2 type="chapter" n="46" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 46.—TREES WHICH LOSE THEIR FRUIT OR FLOWERS MOSTREADILY.</head><p>Young trees are unproductive<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> so long as they are growing.The fruits which fall most readily before they come to maturityare the date, the fig, the almond, the apple, the pear, and thepomegranate, which last tree is also very apt to lose its blossomthrough excessive dews and hoar frosts. For this reason it is,too, that the growers bend the branches of the pomegranate, lest,from being straight, they may receive and retain the moisturethat is so injurious to them. The pear and the almond,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> evenif it should not rain, but a south wind happen to blow or theweather become cloudy, are apt to lose their blossoms, and theirfirst fruit as well, if, after the blossom has fallen, there is acontinuance of such weather. But it is the willow that losesits seed the most speedily of all, long, indeed, before it is ripe;hence it is that Homer has given it the epithet of "fruit-losing."<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> Succeeding ages, however, have given to this terman interpretation conformable to their own wicked practices, itbeing a well-known fact that the seed of the willow has theeffect of producing barrenness in females.In this respect, however, Nature has employed her usualforesight, bestowing but little care upon the seed of a treewhich is produced so easily, and propagated by slips. Thereis, however, it is said, one variety of willow,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> the seed of whicharrives at maturity: it is found in the Isle of Crete, at thedescent from the grotto of Jupiter: the seed is unsightly andligneous, and in size about as large as a chick-pea.<pb n="3387" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This must not be taken to the letter; indeed, Fée thinks that theproper meaning is:—"Young trees do not produce fruit till they havearrived at a certain state of maturity." Trees mostly continue on theincrease till they die.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xvii. c. 2.

Od. x. 1. 510.It has been suggested, Pliny says, that the willow seed had this epithetfrom its effect in causing abortion; but he does not seem to share theopinion.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This cannot be a willow, Fée remarks; indeed, Theophrastus, E. iii.c. 5, speaks of a black poplar as growing there.</p></body>
