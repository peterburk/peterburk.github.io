<div2 type="chapter" n="16" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 16.ÑTHE HORNED OWL.</head><p>The birds of the night also have crooked talons, such as theowlet,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> the horned owl, and the screech-owl, for instance; thesight of all of which is defective in the day-time. The hornedowl is especially funereal, and is greatly abhorred in all auspicesof a public nature: it inhabits deserted places, and not onlydesolate spots, but those of a frightful and inaccessible nature:the monster of the night, its voice is heard, not with any tuneful note, but emitting a sort of shriek. Hence it is that it islooked upon as a direful omen to see it in a city, or even so muchas in the day-time. I know, however, for a fact, that it isnot portentous of evil when it settles on the top of a privatehouse. It cannot fly whither it wishes in a straight line, butis always carried along by a sidelong movement. A hornedowl entered the very sanctuary of the Capitol, in the consulship of Sextus Palpelius Hister and L. Pedanius; in consequence of which, Rome was purified on the nones<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> of Marchin that year.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Noetua, bubo, ulula." It is very doubtful what birds are meant bythese names. Cuvier has been at some pains to identify them, and concludes that the noctua, or glaux of Aristotle, is the Strix brachyotas ofLinn¾us, the "short-eared screech-owl;" the bubo, the Strix bubo ofLinn¾us, and the ulula, the Strix aluco of Linn¾us; our madgehowlet,grey or brown owl.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Seventh of March. The year of their consulship is not known.</p></body>
