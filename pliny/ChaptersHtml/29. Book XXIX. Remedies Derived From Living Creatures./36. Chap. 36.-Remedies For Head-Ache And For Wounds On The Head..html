<div2 type="chapter" n="36" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 36.â€”REMEDIES FOR HEAD-ACHE AND FOR WOUNDS ONTHE HEAD.</head><p>A good remedy for head-ache are the heads taken from thesnails which are found without<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> shells, and in an imperfectstate. In these heads there is found a hard stony substance,about as large as a common pebble: on being extracted from<pb n="5410" />the snail, it is attached to the patient, the smaller snails beingpounded and applied to the forehead. Wool-grease, too, isused for a similar purpose; the bones of a vulture's head, wornas an amulet; or the brains of that bird, mixed with oil andcedar resin, and applied to the head and introduced into thenostrils. The brains of a crow or owlet, are boiled and takenwith the food: or a cock is put into a coop, and kept withoutfood a day and a night, the patient submitting to a similarabstinence, and attaching to his head some feathers pluckedfrom the neck or the comb of the fowl. The ashes, too, of aweasel are applied in the form of a liniment; a twig is takenfrom a kite's nest, and laid beneath the patient's pillow; or amouse's skin is burnt, and the ashes applied with vinegar:sometimes, also, the small bone is extracted from the head ofa snail that has been found between two cart ruts, and afterbeing passed through a gold ring, with a piece of ivory, isattached to the patient in a piece of dog's skin; a remedywell known to most persons, and always used with success.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span></p><p>For fractures of the cranium, cobwebs are applied, with oiland vinegar; the application never coming away till a curehas been effected. Cobwebs are good, too, for stopping thebleeding of wounds<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> made in shaving. Discharges of bloodfrom the brain are arrested by applying the blood of a gooseor duck, or the grease of those birds with oil of roses. Thehead of a snail cut off with a reed, while feeding in themorning, at full moon more particularly, is attached to thehead in a linen cloth, with an old thrum, for the cure of headache; or else a liniment is made of it, and applied with whitewax to the forehead. Dogs' hairs are worn also, attached tothe forehead in a cloth.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He means slugs probably.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He does not appear to state this on hearsay only!</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cobwebs are still used for this purpose, as also the fur from articlesmade of beaver.
