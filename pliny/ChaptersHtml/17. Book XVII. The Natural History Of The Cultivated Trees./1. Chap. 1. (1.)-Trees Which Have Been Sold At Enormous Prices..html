<div2 type="chapter" n="1" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 1. (1.)—TREES WHICH HAVE BEEN SOLD AT ENORMOUSPRICES.</head><p>WE have described the trees which grow spontaneously onland and in the sea,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and it now remains for us to speak ofthose which owe their formation, properly speaking, rather thanbirth, to art and the inventive genius of man.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> Here, however, I cannot but express my surprise, that after the state ofpenury in which man lived, as already described,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> in primitivetimes, holding the trees of the forest in common with the wildbeasts, and disputing with them the possession of the fruitsthat fell, and with the fowls of the air that of the fruits as theyhung on the tree, luxury has now attached to them prices soenormous.</p><p>The most famous instance, in my opinion, of this excess, wasthat displayed by L. Crassus and Cneius Domitius Ahenobarbus. Crassus was one of the most celebrated of the Romanorators; his house was remarkable for its magnificence, thoughin some measure surpassed even by that of Q. Catulus,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>also upon the <placeName key="tgn,3000935" authname="tgn,3000935">Palatine Hill</placeName>; the same Catulus, who, in conjunction with C. Marius, defeated the Cimbri. But by farthe finest house of all that period, it was universally acknowledged, was that of C. Aquilius, a Roman of Equestrian rank,situate upon the Viminal Hill; a house, indeed, that conferreda greater degree of celebrity upon him than even his acquaintance with the civil law. This, however, did not preventCrassus being reproached with the magnificence of his. Crassus and Domitius, members, both of them, of the most illus-<pb n="3439" />trious families, after holding the consulship,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> were appointedjointly to the censorship, in the year from the building of theCity 662, a period of office that was fruitful in strife, thenatural result of their dissimilarity of character. On one occasion, Cneius Domitius, naturally a man of hasty temper, andinflamed besides by a hatred that rivalry only tends to stimulate, gravely rebuked Crassus for living, and he a Censor too,in a style of such magnificence, and in a house for which, ashe said, he himself would be ready to pay down ten millionsof sesterces. Crassus, a man who united to singular presenceof mind great readiness of wit, made answer that, deductingsix trees only, he would accept the offer; upon which Domitius replied, that upon those terms he would not give so muchas a single denarius for the purchase. "<hi rend="ital">Well</hi> then, Domitius," was the rejoinder of Crassus, "which of the two is itthat sets a bad example, and deserves the reproof of the censorship; I, who live like a plain man in a house that hascome to me by inheritance, or you, who estimate six treesat a value of ten millions of sesterces?"<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> These trees wereof the lotus<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> kind, and by the exuberance of their branchesafforded a most delightful shade. Cæcina Largus, one of thegrandees of Rome, and the owner of the house, used often topoint them out to me in my younger days; and, as I have already made mention<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> of the remarkable longevity of trees, Iwould here add, that they were in existence down to the period when the Emperor Nero set fire to the City, one hundredand eighty years after the time of Crassus; being still greenand with all the freshness of youth upon them, had not thatprince thought fit to hasten the death of the very trees even.</p><p>Let no one, however, imagine that the house of Crassus wasof no value in other respects, or that, from the rebuke of Domitius, there was nothing about it worthy of remark with theexception of these trees. There were to be seen erected in theatrium four columns of marble from Mount Hymettus,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> whichin his ædileship he had ordered to be brought over for the decoration of the stage;<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> and this at a time, too, when no public<pb n="3440" />buildings even as yet possessed any pillars made of that material. Of such recent date is the luxury and opulence whichwe now enjoy, and so much greater was the value which inthose days trees were supposed to confer upon a property!A pretty good proof of which, was the fact that Domitius even,with all his enmity, would not keep to the offer he had made,if the trees were not to be included in the bargain.</p><p>The trees have furnished surnames also to the ancients,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> such,for instance, as that of Fronditius to the warrior who swamacross the Volturnus with a wreath of leaves on his head, anddistinguished himself by his famous exploits in the war againstHannibal; and that of Stolo<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> to the Licinian family, such beingthe name given by us to the useless suckers that shoot fromtrees; the best method of clearing away these shoots wasdiscovered by the first Stolo, and hence his name. The ancientlaws also took the trees under their protection; and by theTwelve Tables it was enacted, that he who should wrongfullycut down trees belonging to another person, should pay twenty-five asses for each. Is it possible then to imagine that they,who estimated the fruit-trees at so low a rate as this, could everhave supposed that so exorbitant a value would be put upon thelotus as that which I have just mentioned? And no less mar-vellous, too, are the changes that have taken place in the valueof fruit; for at the present day we find the fruit alone of manyof the trees in the suburbs valued at no less a sum than twothousand sesterces; the profits derived from a single tree thusbeing more than those of a whole estate in former times. Itwas from motives of gain that the grafting of trees and thepropagation thereby of a spurious offspring was first devised,so that the growth of the fruits even might be a thing interdicted to the poor. We shall, therefore, now proceed tostate in what way it is that such vast revenues are derivedfrom these trees, and with that object shall set forth the trueand most approved methods of cultivation; not taking anynotice of the more common methods, or those which we findgenerally adopted, but considering only those points of doubtand uncertainty, in relation to which practical men are mostapt to find themselves at a loss: while, at the same time, to<pb n="3441" />affect any scrupulous exactness in cases where there is nonecessity for it, will be no part of our purpose. In the firstplace, however, we will consider in a general point of view,those influences of soil as well as weather which are exercisedupon all the trees in common.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He alludes to the various shrubs and trees, mentioned as growing inthe sea, B. xiii. c. 48; but which there is little doubt, in reality belong tothe class of fuci.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Fiunt verius quam nascuntur;" a distinction perpetuated in theadage, "Poeta nascitur, non fit."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He probably alludes to his remark in B. xvi. c. 1.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Q.
