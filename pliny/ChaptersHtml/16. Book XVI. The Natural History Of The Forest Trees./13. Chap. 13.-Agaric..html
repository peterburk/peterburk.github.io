<div2 type="chapter" n="13" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 13.ÑAGARIC.</head><p>It is in the Gallic provinces more particularly that the glandiferous trees produce agaric;<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> such being the name given toa white fungus which has a strong odour, and is very useful asan antidote. It grows upon the top of the tree, and givesout a brilliant light<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> at night: this, indeed, is the sign bywhich its presence is known, and by the aid of this light itmay be gathered during the night. The ¾gilops is the onlyone among the glandiferous trees that bears a kind of drycloth,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> covered with a white mossy shag, and this, not onlyattached to the bark, but hanging down from the branches aswell, a cubit even in length: this substance has a strong<pb n="3354" />odour, as we have already<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> stated, when speaking of theperfumes.</p><p>The cork is but a very small tree, and its acorn is of thevery worst<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> quality, and rarely to be found as well: thebark<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> is its only useful product, being remarkably thick, andif removed it will grow again. When straitened out, it hasbeen known to form planks as much as ten feet square. Thissubstance is employed more particularly attached as a buoyto the ropes<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> of ships' anchors and the drag-nets of fishermen.It is employed also for the bungs of casks and as a materialfor the winter shoes<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> of females; for which reason the Greeksnot inappropriately call them<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> "the bark of a tree."</p><p>There are some writers who speak of it as the female of theholm oak; and in the countries where the holm does notgrow, they substitute for it the wood of the cork-tree, moreparticularly in cartwrights' work, in the vicinity of Elis andLaced¾mon for instance. The cork-tree does not grow throughout the whole of Italy, and in no<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> part whatever of Gaul.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Not the white agaric, FŽe says, of modern pharmacy; but, as no kindof agaric is found in the oak, it does not seem possible to identify it. SeeB. xxv. c. 57.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is evident that no fungus would give out phosphoric light; but itmay have resulted from old wood in a state of decomposition.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is pretty clear that one of the lichens of the genus <hi rend="ital">usnea</hi> is herereferred to. Amadue, or German tinder, seems somewhat similar.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">B. xii. c. 50.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">On the contrary, FŽe says, the acorn of the Quercus suber is of a sweetand agreeable flavour, and is much sought as a food for pigs. The hamsof Bayonne are said to owe their high reputation to the acorns of the corktree.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The word "cork" is clearly derived from the Latin "cortex," "bark"See Beckmann's History of Inventions, V. i. p. 320, <hi rend="ital">et seq., Bolrn's Edition,</hi>for a very interesting account of this tree.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This passage, the meaning of which is so obvious, is discussed at somelength by Beckmann, Vol. i. pp. 321, 322.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is still employed for making soles which are impervious to the wet.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is doubtful whether this name was given to the shoes, or the females who wore them, and we have therefore preserved the doubt, in theambiguous "them." Beckmann also discusses this passage, p. 321. Heinforms us, p. 322, that the Roman ladies who wished to appear taller thanthey really were, were in the habit of putting plenty of cork under theirsoles.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">At the present day, it grows in the greatest abundance in France, theLandes more particularly.</p></body>
