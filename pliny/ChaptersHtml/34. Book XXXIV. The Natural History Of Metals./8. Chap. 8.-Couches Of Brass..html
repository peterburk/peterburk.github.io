Piso,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> that Cneius Manlius was the first whointroduced brazen banquetting-couches, buffets, and tableswith single feet,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> when he entered the City in triumph, in theyear of Rome 567, after his conquests in Asia. We alsolearn from Antias,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> that the heirs of L. Crassus, the orator,sold a number of banquetting-couches adorned with brass. The<pb n="6154" />tripods,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> which were called Delphian, because they weredevoted more particularly to receiving the offerings that werepresented to the Delphian Apollo, were usually made of brass:also the pendant lamps,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> so much admired, which were placedin the temples, or gave their light in the form of trees loadedwith fruit; such as the one, for instance, in the Temple of thePalatine Apollo,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> which Alexander the Great, at the sackingof Thebes, brought to Cyme,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> and dedicated to that god.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See end of B. ii.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Triclinia," "abaci," and "monopodia;" these appear to have beencouches for dining-tables, tables furnished with cupboards, and tablesstanding on a single foot. Livy, B. xxxix. c. 6, informs us, that CneiusManlius, in his triumphal procession, introduced into Rome various articlesof Asiatic luxury; "Lectos æratos, vestem stragulam preciosam, monopodia,et abacos." We are not to suppose that the whole of these articleswere made of brass, but that certain parts of them were formed of thismetal, or else were ornamented with brass.—B.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See end of B. ii.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Cortinas tripodum." These articles of furniture consisted of atable or slab, supported by three feet, which was employed, like our sideboards,for the display of plate, at the Roman entertainments.—B.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Lychnuchi pensiles," this term is applied by Suetonius, Julius,s. 37; we may conceive that they were similar to the modern chandeliers.—B</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This temple was dedicated by Augustus A.U.C. 726. The lamps in it,resembling trees laden with fruit, are mentioned by Victor in his descriptionof the Tenth Quarter of the City.—B.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. v. c. 32.</p></body>
