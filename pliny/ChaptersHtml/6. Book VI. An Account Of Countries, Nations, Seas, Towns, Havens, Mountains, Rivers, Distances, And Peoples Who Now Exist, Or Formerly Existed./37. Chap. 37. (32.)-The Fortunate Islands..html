<div2 type="chapter" n="37" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 37. (32.)—THE FORTUNATE ISLANDS.</head><p>There are some authors who think that beyond these are theFortunate Islands,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and some others; the number of whichSebosus gives, as well as the distances, informing us that Junonia<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> is an island seven hundred and fifty miles distant fromGades. He states also that Pluvialia<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and Capraria<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> are thesame distance from Junonia, to the west; and that in Pluvi-alia the only fresh water to be obtained is rain water. Hethen states that at a distance of two hundred and fifty milesfrom these, opposite the left of Mauritania, and situate in thedirection of the sun at the eighth hour, are the FortunateIslands,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> one of which, from its undulating surface, has thename of Invallis,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> and another that of Planasia,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> from the peculiarity<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> of its appearance. He states also that the circumference of Invallis is three hundred miles, and that trees growto a height of one hundred and fourteen feet.</p><p>Relative to the Fortunate Islands, Juba has ascertained thefollowing facts: that they are situate to the south in nearly adue westerly direction, and at a distance from the PurpleIslands of six hundred and twenty-five miles, the sailing beingmade for two hundred and fifty miles due west, and then threehundred and seventy-five towards the east.<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> He states thatthe first is called Ombrios,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> and that it presents no traces ofbuildings whatever; that among the mountains there is a lake,and some trees,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> which bear a strong resemblance to giant<pb n="2108" />fennel, and from which water is extracted; that drawn fromthose that are black is of a bitter taste, but that produced bythe white ones is agreeable and good for drinking. He statesalso that a second island has the name of Junonia, but thatit contains nothing beyond a small temple of stone: also thatin its vicinity there is another, but smaller, island<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> of thesame name, and then another called Capraria, which is infested by multitudes of huge lizards. According to the sameauthor, in sight of these islands is Ninguaria,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> which has received that name from its perpetual snows; this island aboundsalso in fogs. The one next to it is Canaria;<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> it contains vastmultitudes of dogs of very large size, two of which werebrought home to Juba: there are some traces of buildings to beseen here. While all these islands abound in fruit and birdsof every kind, this one produces in great numbers the date palmwhich bears the caryota, also pine nuts. Honey too aboundshere, and in the rivers papyrus, and the fish called silurus,<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>are found. These islands, however, are greatly annoyed bythe putrefying bodies of monsters, which are constantly thrownup by the sea.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or Islands of the Blessed—the modern Canaries.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Supposed to be the modern island of Fuerteventura.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Supposed to be that now called Ferro.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably the modern Gomera.
