<div2 type="chapter" n="18" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 18.—THE NATURE OF ODOURS.</head><p>All the odoriferous<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> substances, and consequently the plants,differ from one another in their colour, smell, and juices. Itis but rarely<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> that the taste of an odoriferous substance is not<pb n="4322" />bitter; while sweet substances, on the other hand, are butrarely odoriferous. Thus it is, too, that wine is more odoriferousthan must, and all the wild plants more so than the cultivatedones.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> Some flowers have a sweet smell at a distance,the edge of which is taken off when they come nearer; such isthe case with the violet, for instance. The rose, when freshgathered, has a more powerful smell at a distance, and dried,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>when brought nearer. All plants have a more penetratingodour, also, in spring<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> and in the morning; as the hour ofmidday approaches, the scent becomes gradually weakened.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>The flowers, too, of young plants are less odoriferous than thoseof old ones; but it is at mid-age<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> that the odour is mostpenetrating in them all.</p><p>The rose and the crocus<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> have a more powerful smell whengathered in fine weather, and all plants are more powerfullyscented in hot climates than in cold ones. In Egypt, however,the flowers are far from odoriferous, owing to the dews andexhalations with which the air is charged, in consequence ofthe extended surface of the river. Some plants have an agreeable,though at the same time extremely powerful smell; some,again, while green, have no<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> smell at all, owing to the excessof moisture, the buceros for example, which is the same as<pb n="4323" />fenugreek.<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> Not all flowers which have a penetrating odourare destitute of juices, the violet, the rose, and the crocus, forexample; those, on the other hand, which have a penetratingodour, but are destitute of juices, have all of them a very powerful smell, as we find the case with the two varieties<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> of thelily. The abrotonum<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> and the amaracus<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> have a pungentsmell. In some plants, it is the flower only that is sweet, theother parts being inodorous, the violet and the rose, for example.</p><p>Among the garden plants, the most odoriferous are the dryones, such as rue, mint, and parsley, as also those which growon dry soils. Some fruits become more odoriferous the olderthey are, the quince, for example, which has also a strongersmell when gathered than while upon the tree. Some plants,again, have no smell but when broken asunder, or when bruised,and others only when they are stripped of their bark. Certainvegetable substances, too, only give out a smell when subjectedto the action of fire, such as frankincense and myrrh, for example. All flowers are more bitter to the taste when bruisedthan when left untouched.<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> Some plants preserve their smella longer time when dried, the melilote, for example; others,again, make the place itself more odoriferous where they grow,the iris<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> for instance, which will even render the whole of atree odoriferous, the roots of which it may happen to havetouched. The hesperis<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> has a more powerful odour at night,a property to which it owes its name.</p><p>Among the animals, we find none that are odoriferous, unnless, indeed, we are inclined to put faith in what has been saidabout the panther.<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span><pb n="4324" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">All these statements as to the odours of various substances, are fromTheophrastus, De Causis, B. vi. c. 22.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He does <hi rend="ital">not</hi> say, however, that it is but rarely that a bitter substanceis not odoriferous; a sense in which Fée seems to have understood him, ashe says, "This assertion is not true in general, and there are numerousexceptions; for instance, quassia wood, which is inodorous and yetintensely bitter." The essential oil, he remarks, elaborated in thetissue of the corolla, is the ordinary source of the emanations ofthe flower.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Fée remarks that cultivation gives to plants a softer and more aqueousconsistency, which is consequently injurious to the developement of theessential oil.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Theophrastus, from whom this is borrowed, might have said withmore justice, Fée remarks, that certain roses have more odour when driedthan when fresh gathered. Such is the case, he says, with the Provencerose. Fresh roses, however, have a more pronounced smell, the nearerthey are to the olfactory organs.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is by no means invariably the case: in fact, the smell of mostodoriferous plants is most powerful in summer.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Because the essential oils evaporate more rapidly.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">With Littré, we adopt the reading "ætate," "mid-age," andnot "æstate," "midsummer," for although the assertion would be ingeneral correct, Pliny would contradict the statement just made, thatall plants have a more penetrating odour in spring. This reading issupported also by the text of Theophrastus.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or saffron.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is a just observation, but the instances might be greatly extended, as Fée says.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xviii. c. 39.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The white lily and the red lily. See c. 11 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">As to the Abrotonum, see B. xiii. c. 2, and c. 34 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See c. 35 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or in other words, the interior of the petals has a more bitter flavourthan that of the exterior surface.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny makes a mistake here, in copying from Theophrastus. De Causis,B. vi. c. 25. That author is speaking not of the flower, but of the rainbow, under the name of "iris." Pliny has himself made a similar statement as to the rainbow, in B. xii. c. 52, which he would appear here tohave forgotten.</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Cheiranthus tristis of Linnæus, or sad gilliflower, Fée thinks.</p><p><span id="note_17"><a href="#ref_17">17. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. viii. c. 23. Pliny did not know of the existence of themuskdeer, the Muschus moschiferus of Eastern Asia: and lie seems notto havethought of the civet, (if, indeed, it was known to him) the fox, the weasel,and the polecat, the exhalations from which have a peculiar smell. Thesame, too, with the urine of the panther and other animals of the genusFelis.</p></body>
