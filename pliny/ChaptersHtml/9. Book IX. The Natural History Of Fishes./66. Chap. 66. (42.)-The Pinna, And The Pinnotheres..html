(42.)ÑTHE PINNA, AND THE PINNOTHERES.</head><p>Belonging to the shell-fish tribe there is the pinna<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> also:it is found<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> in slimy spots, always lying upright, and never<pb n="2451" />without a companion, which some writers call the pinnotheres,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>and others, again, pinnophylax, being a small kind of shrimp,or else a parasitical crab. The pinna,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> which is destitute ofsight, opens its shell, and in so doing exposes its body withinto the attacks of the small fish, which immediately rush upon it,and finding that they can do so with impunity, become bolderand bolder, till at last they quite fill the shell. The pinnotheres, looking out for the opportunity, gives notice to thepinna at the critical moment by a gentle bite, upon whichthe other instantly closes its shell, and so kills whatever it hascaught there; after which, it divides the spoil with its companion.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or pina. The Pinna marina, Cuvier says, is a large bivalve shell-fish,which is remarkable for its fine silky hair, by means of which it fastensitself to the bottom of the sea.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The poet Oppian, Halieut. B. ii. 1. 186, relates the same story aboutthe pinna and its protector; which is also mentioned by Cicero, Plutarch,and Aristotle.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We have already had an account of one pinnotheres, in c. 51. Someof the editions, however, make a difference in the spelling of the name,and call the animal mentioned in the 51st Chapter, "pinnotheres," andthe one here spoken of, the "pinnoteres," the "guardian of the pinna;"from the Greek verb <foreign lang="greek">thre/w,</foreign> "to keep," or "guard." "Pinnophylax"has the same meaning.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier says, that in the shell of the pinna, as, in fact, of all the bivalves, there are often found little crabs, which are, as it were, imprisonedthere; and that it is this fact that has given rise to the story of the treatyof amity between these two animals, which appears in various authors, andis related in various forms, which only agree in being devoid of truth. Cuvier says that a careful distinction must be made between the pinnotheresof this Chapter, the one of which Aristotle makes mention, and that whichis mentioned by Pliny in c. 51, the hermit-crab of the moderns. Therecan, however, be but little doubt that they are different accounts of thesame animal.</p></body>
