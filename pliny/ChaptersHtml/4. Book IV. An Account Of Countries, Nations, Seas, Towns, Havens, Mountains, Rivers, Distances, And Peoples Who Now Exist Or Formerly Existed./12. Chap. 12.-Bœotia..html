The birth-placeof the Muses too is pointed out in the grove of Helicon.To this same Thebes also belong the forest of Cithæron<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>,<pb n="1291" />and the river Ismenus. Besides these, there are in Bœotiathe Fountains of Œdipodia, Psamathe, Dirce, Epicrane,Arethusa, Hippocrene<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>, Aganippe, and Gargaphie; and, besidesthe mountains already mentioned, Mycalesos, Hadylius,and Acontius. The remaining towns between Megara andThebes are Eleutheræ<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>, Haliartus<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>,Platææ<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>, Pheræ, Aspledon<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>, Hyle<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>, Thisbe<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>,Erythræ<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>, Glissas<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span>, and Copæ<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span>; nearthe river Cephisus, Larymna and Anchoa<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span>; as also Medeon,Phlygone, Acræphia<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span>, Coronea<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span>, andChæronea<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span>. Again,<pb n="1292" />on the coast and below Thebes, are Ocalea<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span>, Heleon, Scolos,Schœnos<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span>, Peteon<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span>, Hyriæ<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span>,Mycalesos<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span>, Iresion, Pteleon,Olyros, and Tanagra<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span>, the people of which are free; and,situate upon the very mouth of the Euripus<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span>, a strait formedby the opposite island of Eubœa, Aulis<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span>, so famous for itscapacious harbour. The Bœotians formerly had the nameof Hyantes.</p><p>After them come the Locrians, surnamed Epicnemidii<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span>,formerly called Leleges, through whose country the riverCephisus passes, in its course to the sea. Their towns areOpus<span id="ref_31"><a href="#note_31">[31]</a></span>; from which the Opuntian Gulf<span id="ref_32"><a href="#note_32">[32]</a></span> takes its name, andCynos. Daphnus<span id="ref_33"><a href="#note_33">[33]</a></span> is the only town of Phocis situate on thecoast. In the interior of Locris is Elatea<span id="ref_34"><a href="#note_34">[34]</a></span>, and on thebanks of the Cephisus, as we have previously stated<span id="ref_35"><a href="#note_35">[35]</a></span>, Lilæa,and, facing Delphi, Cnemis<span id="ref_36"><a href="#note_36">[36]</a></span> and Hyampolis<span id="ref_37"><a href="#note_37">[37]</a></span>.
