<div2 type="chapter" n="25" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 25. (21.)ÑLIBURNIA AND ILLYRICUM.</head><p>The nation of the Liburni adjoins the river Arsia<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>, and<pb n="1258" />extends as far as the river Titus. The Mentores, the Hymani<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>,the Enchele¾, the Buni, and the people whom Callimachuscalls the Peuceti¾, formerly formed part of it; but now thewhole in general are comprised under the one name ofIllyricum. But few of the names of these nations are worthyof mention, or indeed very easy of pronunciation. To thejurisdiction of Scardona<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> resort the Iapydes and fourteencities of the Liburni, of which it may not prove tedious if Imention the Lacinienses, the Stlupini, the Burnist¾, andthe Olbonenses. Belonging to the same jurisdiction thereare, in the enjoyment of Italian rights, the Alut¾<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, theFlanates<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>, from whom the Gulf takes its name, the Lopsi,and the Varvarini; the Assesiates, who are exempt fromtribute; and upon the islands, the Fertinates and the Curictt¾<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>.</p><p>Besides these, there are on the coast, after leavingNesactium, Alvona<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>, Flanona, Tarsatica, Senia,Lopsica, Ortopula,Vegium, Argyruntum, Corinium<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>, ®nona, the city ofPasinum, and the river Tedanius, at which Iapydia terminates. Theislands of this Gulf, with their towns, besidesthose above mentioned, are Absyrtium<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>, Arba<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>, Crexa, Gissa,<pb n="1259" />and Portunata. Again, on the mainland there is the colonyof Iadera<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>, distant from Pola 160 miles; then, at adistance of thirty miles, the island of Colentum<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>, and ofeighteen, the mouth of the river Titus.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From the river now called the Arsa to that called the Kerka.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hardouin thinks that "Ismeni" is the proper reading here; but allthe MSS. seem to be against him.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Mentioned in the next Chapter.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Their town was Aluus or Aloiis.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Their town was Flanona, which gave name to the Sinus Flanaticusor Golfo di Quarnero. The chief town of the Lopsi was Lopsica, andof the Varvarini, Varvaria.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The island of Fertina is supposed to have been the modern Berwitchor Parvich. Curicta is now called Karek or Veglia. The Illyrian snailsmentioned by our author, B. ix. c. 56, are very numerous here. CaiusAntonius, the brother of Marcus, acting under Julius C¾sar,was besieged here by Libo. See the interesting account inLucan's Pharsalia, B. iv. 1. 402Ð464.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The places on their sites are now called Albona, Fianona, Tersact orTersat near Fiume, Segna, Lopsico, Ortopia, and Veza.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Carin. ®nona is now called Nona, and the Tedanius is themodern Zermagna.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The whole of this group of islands were sometimes called the Absyrtides, from Absyrtus, the brother of Medea, who according to traditionwas slain there. See the last Chapter, p. 266.. Ovid, however, in his"Tristia," states that this took place at Tomi, on the Pontus Euxinus orBlack Sea, the place of his banishment.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Said by D'Anville to be now called Arbe, and Crexa to be the modernCherso.

The city of Zara or Zara Vecchiastands on its site.
