(13.)ÑMETHODS FOR ARRESTING H®MORRHAGE.</head><p>Bleeding at the nostrils is arrested by mutton suet takenfrom the caul, introduced into the nostrils; by draing uprennet, lamb's rennet in particular, mixed with water, into thenostrils, or by using it as an injection, a remedy which succeedseven where other remedies; have failed: by making up goosegrease into a bolus with an equall quantity of butter, andplugging the nostrils with it; or by using the earth thatadheres to snails, or else the snails themselves, extracted fromthe shell. Excessive discharges from the nostrils are arrestedalso by applying crushed snails, or cobwebs, to the forehead.For issues of blood from the brain, the blood or brains ofpoultry are used, as also pigeons' dung, thickened and keptfor the purpose. In cases where there is and immoderate flowof blood from a wound, an application of horse-dung, burntwith egg-shells, is marvellously good for stopping it.</p></div2></body>
