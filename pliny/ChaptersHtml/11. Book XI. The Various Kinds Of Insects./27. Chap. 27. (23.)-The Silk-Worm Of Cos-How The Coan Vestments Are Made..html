(23.)—THE SILK-WORM OF COS—HOW THE COANVESTMENTS ARE MADE.</head><p>The silk-worm, too, is said to be a native of the isle of Cos,where the vapours of the earth give new life to the flowersof the cypress, the terebinth, the ash, and the oak which havebeen beaten down by the showers. At first they assume theappearance of small butterflies with naked bodies, but soonafter, being unable to endure the cold, they throw out bristlyhairs, and assume quite a thick coat against the winter, byrubbing off the down that covers the leaves, by the aid ofthe roughness of their feet. This they compress into ballsby carding it with their claws, and then draw it out andhang it between the branches of the trees, making it fineby combing it out as it were: last of all, they take and roll itround their body, thus forming a nest in which they are enveloped. It is in this state that they are taken; after whichthey are placed in earthen vessels in a warm place, and fedupon bran. A peculiar sort of down soon shoots forth uponthe body, on being clothed with which they are sent to workupon another task. The cocoons<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> which they have begun toform are rendered soft and pliable by the aid of water, andare then drawn out into threads by means of a spindle made ofa reed. Nor, in fact, have the men even felt ashamed to makeuse<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> of garments formed of this material, in consequence of<pb n="3027" />their extreme lightness in summer: for, so greatly have manners degenerated in our day, that, so far from wearing a cuirass,a garment even is found to be too heavy. The produce of theAssyrian silk-worm, however, we have till now left to thewomen only.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Lanificia."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Early in the reign of Tiberius, as we learn from Tacitus, the senate enacted "ne vestis Serica viros fædaret"—' That men should not defilethemselves by wearing garments of silk," Ann.
