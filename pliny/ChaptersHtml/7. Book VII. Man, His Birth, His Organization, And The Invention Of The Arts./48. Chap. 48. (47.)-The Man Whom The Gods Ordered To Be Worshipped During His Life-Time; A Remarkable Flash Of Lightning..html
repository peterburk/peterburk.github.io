(47.)ÑTHE MAN WHOM THE GODS ORDERED TO BE WORSHIPPED DURING HIS LIFE-TIME; A REMARKABLE FLASH OF LIGHTNING.</head><p>While still surviving, and in full possession of his senses,by the command of the same oracle, and with the sanction ofJupiter, the supreme Father of the gods, Euthymus,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> thepugilist, who had always, with one exception, been victoriousin the Olympic games, was deified. He was a native of Locri,<pb n="2200" />in Italy. I find that Callimachus,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> considering it a morewonderful circumstance than any he had ever known, that thetwo statues which had been erected to him, one at Locri, andthe other at Olympia, were struck by lightning on the sameday, ordered sacrifices to be offered up to him, which wasaccordingly done, both during his life-time, and after hisdeath. Nothing, indeed, has appeared to me so remarkable,as this mark of approval given by the gods.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We have some account of Euthymus in Pausanias, B. vi., and in®ian, Var. Hist.
