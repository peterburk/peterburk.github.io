<div2 type="chapter" n="29" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 29. (15.)—NINETY-SIX ISLANDS OF THE GALLIC OCEAN.</head><p>In the Rhine itself, nearly 100 miles in length, is themost famous island<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> of the Batavi and the Canninefates, asalso other islands of the Frisii<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>, the Chauci, theFrisiabones<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>, the Sturii<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, and the Marsacii, which liebetween Helium<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> and Flevum<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>. These are the names of themouths<pb n="1350" />into which the Rhine divides itself, discharging its waters onthe north into the lakes there, and on the west into the riverMosa. At the middle mouth which lies between these two,the river, having but a very small channel, preserves its ownname.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This island appears to have been formed by the bifurcation of theRhine, the northern branch of which enters the sea at Katwyck, a fewmiles north of Leyden, by the Waal and the course of the Maas, after it hasreceived the Waal, and by the sea. The Waal or Vahalis seems to haveundergone considerable changes, and the place of its junction with theMaas may have varied. Pliny makes the island nearly 100 miles in length,which is about the distance from the fort of Schenkenschanz, where thefirst separation of the Rhine takes place, to the mouth of the Maas. Thename of Batavia was no doubt the genuine name, which is still preservedin Betuwe, the name of a district at the bifurcation of the Rhine and theWaal. The Canninefates, a people of the same race as the Batavi, alsooccupied the island, and as the Batavi seem to have been in the easternpart, it is supposed that the Canninefates occupied the western. Theywere subdued by Tiberius in the reign of Augustus.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Frisii or Frisones were one of the great tribes of north-westernGermany, properly belonging to the group of the Ingævones. They in-habited the country about Lake Flevo and other lakes, between the Rhineand the Ems, so as to be bounded on the south by the Bructeri, and onthe east by the Chauci. Tacitus distinguishes between the Frisii Majores and Minores, and it is supposed that the latter dwelt on the east ofthe canal of Drusus in the north of Holland, and the former between therivers Flevus and Amisia, that is, in the country which still bears thename of Friesland. The Chauci have been previously mentioned.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Frisiabones or Frisævones are again mentioned in C. 31 of thepresent Book as a people of Gaul. In what locality they dwelt has notbeen ascertained by historians.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Sturii are supposed to have inhabited the modern South Holland,while the Marsacii probably inhabited the island which the Meuse formsat its junction with the Rhine, at the modern Dortrecht in Zealand.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Supposed to be the site of the modern fortress of Briel, situate atthe mouth of the Meuse.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably the same as the modern Vlieland (thus partly retaining itsancient name), an island north of the Texel. The more ancient writersspeak of two main arms, into which the Rhine was divided on enteringthe territory of the Batavi, of which the one on the east continued to bearthe name of Rhenus, while that on the west into which the Masa, Maasor Meuse, flowed, was called Vahalis or Waal. After Drusus, B.C. <date value="-12" authname="--12">12</date>,had connected the Flevo Lacus or Zuvder-Zee with the Rhine by meansof a canal, in forming which he probably made use of the bed of theYssel, we find mention made of three mouths of the Rhine. Of thesethe names, as given by Pliny, are, on the west, Helium (the Yahalis ofother writers), in the centre Rhenus, and at the north Flevum; but ata later period we again find mention made of only two mouths.</p></body>
