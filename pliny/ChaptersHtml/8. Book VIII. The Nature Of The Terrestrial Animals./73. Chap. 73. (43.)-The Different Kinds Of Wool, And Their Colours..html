<div2 type="chapter" n="73" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 73. (43.)—THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF WOOL, AND THEIR COLOURS. <span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span></head><p>The most esteemed wool of all is that of Apulia, and thatwhich in Italy is called Grecian wool, in other countriesItalian. The fleeces of Miletus hold the third rank.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> TheApulian wool is shorter in the hair, and only owes its highcharacter to the cloaks<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> that are made of it. That whichcomes from the vicinity of Tarentum and Canusium is the mostcelebrated; and there is a wool from Laodicea, in Asia, of asimilar quality.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> There is no white wool superior to that ofthe countries bordering on the Padus,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> nor up to the presentday has any wool exceeded the price of one hundred sestercesper pound.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> The sheep are not shorn in all countries; in someplaces it is still the custom to pull off the wool.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> There arevarious colours of wool; so much so, indeed, that we wantterms to express them all. Several kinds, which are called<pb n="2334" />native,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> are found in Spain; Pollentia, in the vicinity of theAlps,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> produces black fleeces of the best quality; Asia, as wellas Bætica,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> the red fleeces, which are called Erythræan; thoseof Canusium are of a tawny colour;<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> and those of Tarentumhave their peculiar dark tint.<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> All kinds of wool, when notfreed from the grease,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> possess certain medicinal properties.The wool of Istria is much more like hair than wool, and isnot suitable for the fabrication of stuffs that have a long nap;<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>so too is that which Salacia,<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> in Lusitania, finds the most usefulfor making its chequered cloths. There is a similar wool, too,found about Piscenæ,<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> in the province of Narbonensis, as alsoin Egypt; a garment, when it has been worn for some time,is often embroidered with this wool, and will last for a considerable time.</p><p>The thick, flocky wool has been esteemed for the manufacture of carpets from the very earliest times; it is quiteclear, from what we read in Homer, that they were in use inhis time.<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> The Gauls embroider them in a different mannerfrom that which is practised by the Parthians.<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> Wool is<pb n="2335" />compressed also for making a felt,<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> which, if soaked in vinegar,<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span>is capable of resisting iron even; and, what is still more, afterhaving gone through the last process,<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> wool will even resistfire; the refuse, too, when taken out of the vat of the scourer,is used for making mattresses,<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> an invention, I fancy, of theGauls. At all events, it is by Gallic names that we distinguish the different sort of mattresses<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span> at the present day;but I am not well able to say at what period wool began to beemployed for this purpose. Our ancestors made use of straw<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span>for the purpose of sleeping upon, just as they do at presentwhen in camp. The gausapa<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span> has been brought into use inmy father's memory, and I myself recollect the amphimalla<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span>and the long shaggy apron<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span> being introduced; but at the present day, the laticlave tunic<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span> is beginning to be manufactured,in imitation of the gausapa.<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span> Black wool will take no colour.<pb n="2336" />I shall describe the mode of dyeing the other kinds of woolwhen speaking of the sea-purple,<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span> or of the nature of variousplants.<span id="ref_31"><a href="#note_31">[31]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The greatest part of this Chapter appears to be taken, with little variation, from Columella, B. vii. c. 2—4.—B.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Here Pliny differs from Columella, who remarks, B. vii. c. 2, "Ourpeople considered the Milesian, Calabrian, and Apulian wool as of excellent quality, and the Tarentine the best of all."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Pænula" was a check cloak, used chiefly by the Romans whentravelling, instead of the toga, as a protection against the cold and rain.It was used by women as well as men. It was long, and without sleeves,and with only an opening for the head. Women were forbidden by Alexander Severus to wear it in the city. It was made particularly of thewoolly substance known as gausapa.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The wool of Laodicea is celebrated by Strabo, B. xii.—B.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Columella, B. vii. c. 2, particularly notices the excellence of the woolof Altinum, situate near the mouth of the Padus or Po. The followingepigram of Martial, B. xiv. c. 155, may be presumed to convey the opinionof the respective merits of the different kinds of wool; it is entitled "Lanæalbæ:" "Velleribus primis Apulia; Parma secundis Nobilis; Altinumtertia laudat ovis." "Apulia is famed for its fleeces of the first quality,Parma for the second, while Altinum is praised for those of the third."—B.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">About twelve shillings sterling.—B.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Varro remarks, B. ii. c. 2, that the term "vellus." obviously from"vello," "to pluck," proves that the wool was anciently plucked from thesheep, before shearing had been invented.—B.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Quas nativas appellant." The term "nativa," as applied to thewool, has been supposed to refer to those fleeces that possess a naturalcolour, and do not require to be dyed.—B.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Martial, B. xiv. Ep. 157, calls the fleeces of Pollentia "lugentes,""mournful," from their black colour; they are also mentioned by Colu-mella, <hi rend="ital">ubi supra,</hi> and by Silius Italicus, B. viii. 1. 599.—B.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Martial, B. v. c. 37, describing the charms of a lady, says, "surpassing with her locks the fleece of the Bætic sheep," no doubt referringto the colour. In another Epigram, B. xii. E. 200, he speaks of the"aurea vellera," the "golden fleece" of Bætis.—B.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Martial has two Epigrams on the wool of Canusium, B. xiv. E. 127,and E. 129. In the former it is designated as "fusca," tawny; in thelatter, "rufa," red.—B.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Suæ pulliginis."—B.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The term here used, "succidus," is explained by Varro, B. ii. c. 11:"While the newly-clipped wool has the sweat in it, it is called ' succida.'"See B. xxix. c. 9.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Pexis vestibus." According to Hardouin, the "pexa vestis," wasworn by the rich, and had a long and prominent nap, in contradistinctionto the smooth or worn cloths. He refers to a passage in Horace, B. i. Ep. i.1. 95, and to one in Martial, B. ii. E. 58, which appear to sanction thisexplanation. See Lem. vol. iii. p. 524.—B.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. iv. c. 35.</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. iii. c. 5.

"And to throw on fair coverlets of purple, and to laycarpets upon them."</p><p><span id="note_18"><a href="#ref_18">18. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">These were probably much like what we call "Turkey" carpets.</p><p><span id="note_19"><a href="#ref_19">19. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The name given to this article, "lana coacta," "compressed wool,"correctly designates its texture. The manufacturers of it were called "lanarii coactores," and "lanarii coactiliarii."</p><p><span id="note_20"><a href="#ref_20">20. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"I have macerated unbleached flax in vinegar saturated with salt,and after compression have obtained a felt, with a power of resistance quitecomparable with that of the famous armour of Conrad of Montferrat;seeing that neither the point of a sword, nor even balls discharged fromfire-arms, were able to penetrate it." <hi rend="ital">Memoir on the substance called Plina,</hi><hi rend="ital">by Papadopoulo-Vretos, on the Mein. presented to the Royal Academy of In-</hi><hi rend="ital">scriptions and Belles Lettres, <date value="1845" authname="1845">1845</date> , as quoted by Littré.</hi></p><p><span id="note_21"><a href="#ref_21">21. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny probably conceived that by the removal of all the grease fromthe wool, or the "purgamentum," it became less combustible.—B.</p><p><span id="note_22"><a href="#ref_22">22. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Tomentum;" an Epigram of Martial, B. xiv.

The wealthier Romans hadit made of the finest wool, and mostly of a purple colour. It seems also tohave been sometimes made of linen, but still with a rough surface.</p><p><span id="note_26"><a href="#ref_26">26. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From <foreign lang="greek">a)mfi/malla,</foreign>"napped on both sides."
