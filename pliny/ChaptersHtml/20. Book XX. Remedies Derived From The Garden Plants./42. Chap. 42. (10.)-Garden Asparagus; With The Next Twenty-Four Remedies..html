With the addition of cummin, it dispelsflatulency of the stomach and colon; it sharpens the eyesightalso, acts as a mild aperient upon the stomach, and, boiled withwine, is good for pains in the chest and spine, and diseases ofthe intestines. For pains in the loins and kidneys asparagus-seed<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> is administered in doses of three oboli, taken with anequal proportion of cummin-seed. It acts as an aphrodisiac,and is an extremely useful diuretic, except that it has a tendency to ulcerate the bladder.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span></p><p>The root, also, pounded and taken in white wine, is highlyextolled by some writers, as having the effect of disengagingcalculi, and of soothing pains in the loins and kidneys;there are some persons, too, who administer this root withsweet wine for pains in the uterus. Boiled in vinegar theroot is very beneficial in cases of elephantiasis. It is said thatif a person is rubbed with asparagus beaten up in oil, he willnever be stung by bees.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Asparagus is recognized in modern times, as exercising a strong actionon the kidneys.
