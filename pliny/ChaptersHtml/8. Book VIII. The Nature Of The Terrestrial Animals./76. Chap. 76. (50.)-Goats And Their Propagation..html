<div2 type="chapter" n="76" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 76. (50.)—GOATS AND THEIR PROPAGATION.</head><p>The goat occasionally brings forth as many as four at abirth; but this is rarely the case.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> It is pregnant five months,<pb n="2340" />like the sheep. Goats become barren when very fat. Thereis little advantage to be derived from their bringing forthbefore their third year, or after the fourth, when they beginto grow old.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> They are capable of generating in the seventhmonth, and while they are still sucking. In both sexes thosethat have no horns are considered the most valuable.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> Asingle coupling in the day is not sufficient; the second and thefollowing ones are more effectual. They conceive in the monthof November, so as to bring forth in the month of March,when the buds are bursting; this is sometimes the case withthem when only one year old, and always with those of thesecond year; but the produce of those which are three yearsold is the most valuable.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> They continue to bring forth for aperiod of eight years. Cold produces abortion. When theireyes are surcharged, the female discharges the blood from theeye by pricking it with the point of a bulrush, and the malewith the thorn of a bramble.</p><p>Mutianus relates an instance of the intelligence of thisanimal, of which he himself was an eye-witness. Two goats,coming from opposite directions, met on a very narrow bridge,which would not admit of either of them turning round, andin consequence of its great length, they could not safely gobackwards, there being no sure footing on account of itsnarrowness, while at the same time an impetuous torrent wasrapidly rushing beneath; accordingly, one of the animals laydown flat, while the other walked over it.</p><p>Among the males, those are the most esteemed which haveflat noses and long hanging ears,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> the shoulders being covered<pb n="2341" />with very thick shaggy hair; the mark of the most valuableamong the females is the having two folds<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> hanging down thebody from under the neck. Some of these animals have nohorns; but where there are horns, the age of the animal isdenoted by the number of knots on them. Those that haveno horns give the most milk.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> According to Archelaus,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> theybreathe, not through the nose, but the ears,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> and they arenever entirely free from fever,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> from which circumstance it is,probably, that they are more animated than sheep, more ardent,and have stronger sexual passions. It is said also, that theyhave the power of seeing by night as well as in the day, forwhich reason those persons who are called Nyctalopes,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> recover the power of seeing in the evening, by eating the liverof the he-goat. In Cilicia, and in the vicinity of the Syrtes,the inhabitants shear the goat for the purpose of clothingthemselves.<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> It is said that the she-goats in the pastures willnever look at each other at sun-set, but lie with their backstowards one another,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> while at other times of the day they liefacing each other and in family groups. They all have long hairhanging down from the chin, which is called by us aruncus.<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>If any one of the flock is taken hold of and dragged by thishair, all the rest gaze on in stupid astonishment; and the same<pb n="2342" />happens when any one of them has eaten of a certain herb<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>Their bite is very destructive to trees, and they make theolive barren by licking it;<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> for which reason they are notsacrificed to Minerva.<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We have an account of the generation of the goat in Aristotle. Hist. Anim. B. vi. c. 19. Ælian, Anim. Nat. B. iii. c. 38, says that the goatsof Egypt sometimes produce five young ones at a birth.—B.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Columella, B. vii. c. 6, gives a somewhat different account; he says,"Before its sixth year it is old-so that when five years old, it is not suitable for coupling."—B.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">According to Columella, <hi rend="ital">ubi supra,</hi> "Because those with horns areusually troublesome, from their uncertainty of temper."—B.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There has been considerable difference of opinion respecting the reading of the original, whether the word "utiles," or "inutiles," was the onehere employed. Hardouin conceives it was the latter, and endeavours toreconcile the sense with this reading; Lemaire, vol. iii. pp. 538, 539. But,notwithstanding his high authority, there is still great doubt on the matter.—B.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Infractis," probably in contradistinction to erect ears. Columella,<hi rend="ital">ubi supra,</hi> terms them, "flaccidis et prægrandibus auribus"—"flaccid ears,and very large."—B.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Laciniæ;" Varro, B. ii. c. 3, describes them as "mammulas pensiles;" Columclla, <hi rend="ital">ubi supra,</hi> calls them "verruculas;" he, however, assignsthis appendage to the male goat.—B.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The word "mutilus" is employed, which Hardouin interprets, "having had the horns removed." But the same word is applied by Columella,B. vii. c. 6, to an animal naturally without horns.—B.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">On this reference to Archelaus, Dalechamps remarks that he is incorrect; but refers to Varro, <hi rend="ital">ubi supra,</hi> who ascribes this opinion to Archelaus;Lemaire, vol. iii. p. 540.—B.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. i. c. 9, refers to this opinion, as being erroneous; Ælian, Hist. Anim. B. i. c. 53, supposes that they breathe boththrough the nose and the ears.—B.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Varro, <hi rend="ital">ubi supra,</hi> remarks, "that no one in his senses speaks of a goatin health; for they are never without fever."</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Meaning those who cannot see at night, who have a weak sight, andtherefore require a strong light to distinguish objects. See also, as to theNyctalopes, B. xxviii. c. 47. The same remedy, the liver of the goat, isrecommended for its cure.—B. See also B. xxviii. c. 11.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 28, says that the inhabitants of Ciliciashear the goats in the same manner as the sheep.—B.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is mentioned by Aristotle, Hist.

Ovid, on the other hand, inthe Fasti, B. i. 1. 360, says that the goat was sacrificed to Bacchus, <hi rend="ital">because</hi>it gnawed the vine.</p></body>
