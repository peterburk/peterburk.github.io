<div2 type="chapter" n="26" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 26.—RADISHES.</head><p>Radishes are composed of an outer coat and a cartilaginoussubstance, and in many instances the rind is found to be thickerthan the bark of some trees. This plant is remarkable for itspungency, which increases in proportion to the thickness of therind: in some cases, too, the surface of it assumes a ligneousnature. Radishes are flatulent<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> to a remarkable degree, andare productive of eructations; hence it is that they are lookedupon as an aliment only fit for low-bred people,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and thismore particularly if coleworts are eaten directly after them.If, on the other hand, they are eaten with green olives, theeructations produced are not so frequent, and less offensive.In Egypt the radish is held in very high esteem, on accountof the abundance of oil<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> that is extracted from the seed. In-<pb n="4163" />deed, the people of that country sow this plant in preferenceto any other, whenever they can get the opportunity, the profitsderived from it being larger than those obtained from the cultivation of corn, and the imposts levied upon it considerably less:there is no grain known that yields a larger quantity of oil.</p><p>The Greeks have distinguished the radish<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> into three different kinds, according to the characteristic features of theleaves, there being the crisped leaf, the smooth leaf, and thewild radish, the leaf of which is smooth, but shorter than thatof the others; it is round also, grows in great abundance, andspreads like a shrub. The taste of this last variety is acrid,and it acts medicinally as a strong purgative. In the first kind,again, there are certain differences, determined by the seed, forin some varieties the seed is of an inferior quality, and in othersremarkably small: these defects, however, are only found toexist in the kind that has the crisped leaf.</p><p>Our own people, again, have found other varieties of theradish: there is the Algidan<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> radish, long and transparent, socalled from the place of its growth: another, similar to therape in form, is known as the Syrian radish; it is prettynearly the mildest and the most tender of them all, and is wellable to bear the winter. The very best of all, however, is theone that has been brought from Syria, very recently it wouldseem, as we do not find it mentioned by any of our writers:it lasts the whole of the winter through. In addition to thesekinds, there is another, a wild variety, known by the Greeks as"agrion,"<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> and to the people of Pontus as "armon," whileothers, again, call it "leuce,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> and our people "armoracia;"<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>it has more leaves, however, than root.</p><p>In testing the quality of the radish, it is the stem more par-<pb n="4164" />ticularly, that is looked at; in those which are acrid to thetaste, for instance, it is rounder and thicker than in the others,and grooved with long channels, while the leaves are more unsightly to the eye, being angular and covered with prickles.</p><p>The radish requires to be sown in a loose, humid soil, has agreat aversion to manure, and is content with a dressing solelyof chaff: so fond is it of the cold, that in Germany it is knownto grow as large as an infant in size.<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> For the spring crop,it is sown immediately after the ides of February;<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> and thenagain about the time of the Vulcanalia,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> this last crop beinglooked upon as the best: many persons, however, sow radishesin March, April, and September. When the plant begins togrow to any size, it is considered a good plan to cover up theleaves successively, and to earth up the root as well; for thepart of it which appears above ground is apt to become hardand pithy. Aristomachus recommends the leaves to be takenoff in winter, and the roots to be well moulded up, to preventthe water from accumulating about them; and he says, thatby using these precautions, they will be all the finer in summer.Some authors have mentioned a plan of making a hole with adibble, and covering it at the bottom with a layer of chaff, sixfingers in depth; upon this layer the seed is put, and thencovered over with manure and earth; the result of which is,according to their statement, that radishes are obtained full aslarge as the hole so made. It is salt, however, that conducesmore particularly to their nutriment, and hence it is that they areoften watered with brine; in Egypt, too, the growers sprinklenitre<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> over them, the roots being remarkable for their mildnessThe salt, too, has the similar effect of removing all their pungency, and when thus treated, they become very similar intheir qualities to radishes that have been boiled: for whenboiled they become sweet and mild, and eat, in fact, just liketurnips.<pb n="4165" /></p><p>Medical men recommend raw radishes to be eaten fasting,with salt, for the purpose<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> of collecting the crude humours ofthe viscera; and in this way they prepare them for the actionof emetics. It is said, too, that the juices of this plant areabsolutely necessary for the cure of certain diseases of thediaphragm; for it has been found by experiment, in Egypt,that the phthiriasis<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> which attaches itself to the internal partsof the heart, cannot possibly be eradicated by any other remedy,the kings of that country having ordered the bodies of thedead to be opened and examined, for the purpose of enquiringinto certain diseases.</p><p>Such, too, is the frivolity of the Greeks, that, in the templeof Apollo at Delphi, it is said, the radish is so greatly preferred to all other articles of diet, as to be represented there ingold, the beet in silver, and the rape in lead.—You might bevery sure that Manius Curius was not a native of that country,the general whom, as we find stated in our Annals, the ambassadors of the Samnites found busy roasting rape at the fire,when they came to offer him the gold which he so indignantlyrefused. Moschion, too, a Greek author, has written a volumeon the subject of the radish. These vegetables are considereda very useful article of food during the winter; but they are atall times very injurious to the teeth, as they are apt to wearthem away; at all events, they give a polish to ivory. Thereis a great antipathy between the radish<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> and the vine; whichlast will shrink from the radish, if sown in its vicinity.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This property extends to most of the Cruciferæ.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Cibus illiberalis."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The variety Oleifera of the Raphanus sativus is still cultivated extensively in Egypt and Nubia for the extraction of the oil.

It is worthy of remark, too, that the Colza oil, somuch used in France and Belgium for burning in lamps, is expressed fromthe seed of the Brassica oleracea, a species of cabbage.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Raphanus sativus of Linnæus.
