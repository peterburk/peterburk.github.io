They arrest bleeding, also, more<pb n="6212" />particularly from wounds inflicted with iron; and they act asa check upon female discharges. They are applied, too, fordiseases of the spleen, and they arrest h¾morrhoidal swellingsand serpiginous ulcers. They are useful also for affections ofthe eyelids, gradually applied in the form of a fine powder.But their chief recommendation is, their great utility in theform of a hygremplastrum<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> or wet plaster, for cleansingwounds and fistulous sores, consuming all kinds of callosities,and making new flesh on bones that are denuded. The followingare the ingredients: of pitch, six oboli, of Cimolian chalk,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>six drachm¾, two drachm¾ of pounded copper, the same quantityof scales of iron, six drachm¾ of wax, and one sextarius of oil.To these is added some cerate, when it is wanted to cleanseor fill up wounds.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The scaly excrescences beaten from iron in the forges, Hardouin says.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From the Greek <foreign lang="greek">u(/gron plastro\n</foreign>.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxxv. c. 57.ÑB.</p></body>
