<div2 type="chapter" n="41" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 41.—THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF IRON, AND THE MODE OFTEMPERING IT.</head><p>Iron ores are to be found almost everywhere; for they exist<pb n="6207" />even in the Italian island of Ilva,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> being easily distinguishedby the ferruginous colour of the earth. The method of workingthe ore is the same as that employed in the case of copper. InCappadocia, however, it is peculiarly questionable whether thismetal is a present due to the water or to the earth; because,when the latter has been saturated with the water of a certainriver, it yields, and then only, an iron that may be obtainedby smelting.</p><p>There are numerous varieties of iron ore; the chief causesof which arise from differences in the soil and in the climate.Some earths produce a metal that is soft, and nearly akin tolead; others an iron that is brittle and coppery, the use of whichmust be particularly avoided in making wheels or nails, theformer kind being better for these purposes. There is anotherkind, again, which is only esteemed when cut into short lengths,and is used for making hobnails;<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and another which ismore particularly liable to rust. All these varieties are knownby the name of "strictura,"<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> an appellation which is not usedwith reference to the other metals, and is derived from the steelthat is used for giving an edge.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> There is a great difference,<pb n="6208" />too, in the smelting; some kinds producing knurrs of metal,which are especially adapted for hardening into steel, or else,prepared in another manner, for making thick anvils or headsof hammers. But the main difference results from the quality ofthe water into which the red-hot metal is plunged from time totime. The water, which is in some places better for this purposethan in others, has quite ennobled some localities for theexcellence of their iron, Bilbilis,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> for example, and Turiasso<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>in Spain, and Comum<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> in Italy; and this, although there areno iron mines in these spots.</p><p>But of all the different kinds of iron, the palm of excellenceis awarded to that which is made by the Seres,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>who send it tous with their tissues and skins;<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> next to which, in quality, isthe Parthian<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> iron. Indeed, none of the other kinds of iron aremade of the pure hard metal, a softer alloy being welded withthem all. In our part of the world, a vein of ore is occasionallyfound to yield a metal of this high quality, as in Noricum<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> forinstance; but, in other cases, it derives its value from themode of working it, as at Sulmo,<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> for example, a result owingto the nature of its water, as already stated. It is to be observedalso, that in giving an edge to iron, there is a great differencebetween oil-whetstones and water-whetstones,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> the useof oil producing a much finer edge. It is a remarkable fact,that when the ore is fused, the metal becomes liquefied like<pb n="6209" />water, and afterwards acquires a spongy, brittle texture. It isthe practice to quench smaller articles made of iron with oil,lest by being hardened in water they should be rendered brittle.Human blood revenges itself upon iron; for if the metal has beenonce touched by this blood it is much more apt to become rusty.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Isle of Elba, which has been celebrated for the extent and therichness of its iron mines both by the ancients and the moderns.—B.Ajasson remarks that it appears to be a solid rock composed of peroxideof iron.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">" Clavis caligariis."

Beckmann has the following remarksin reference to this passage:—"In my opinion, this was the namegiven to pieces of steel completely manufactured and brought to that statewhich rendered them fit for commerce. At present steel comes fromBiscay in cakes, from other places in bars, and both these were formerlycalled 'stricturæ,' because they were employed chiefly for giving sharpnessto instruments, or tools, that is, for steeling them. In speaking of othermetals, Pliny says that the finished productions at the works were not called'stricturæ' (the case, for example, with copper), though sharpness couldbe given to instruments with other metals also. The words of Pliny justquoted are read different ways, and still remain obscure. I conjecturethat he meant to say, that some steel-works produced things which wereentirely of steel, and that others were employed only in steeling—'addensandas incudes malleorumve rostra.' I shall here remark that these'stricturæ ferri' remind us of the ' striges auri,' (see B. xxxiii. c. 19),such being the name given to native pieces of gold, which, without beingsmelted, were used in commerce."—Hist.

The iron was probably formed into thin, long bars, in thickness resembling a steel used for sharpening.
