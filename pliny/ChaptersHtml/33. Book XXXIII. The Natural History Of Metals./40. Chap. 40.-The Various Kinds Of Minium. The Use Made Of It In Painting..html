<div2 type="chapter" n="40" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 40.—THE VARIOUS KINDS OF MINIUM. THE USE MADE OFIT IN PAINTING.</head><p>According to Juba minium is also a production of Carmania,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>and Timagenes says that it is found in Æthiopia. But fromneither of those regions is it imported to Rome, nor, indeed,<pb n="6122" />from hardly any other quarter but Spain ; that of most notecoming from Sisapo,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> a territory of Bætica, the mine of miniumthere forming a part of the revennes of the Romanpeople. Indeed there is nothing guarded with a more constantcircumspection; for it is not allowable to reduce and refinethe ore upon the spot, it being brought to Rome in a crudestate and under seal, to the amount of about two thousandpounds per annum. At Rome, the process of washing is performed,and, in the sale of it, the price is regulated by statute;it not being allowed to exceed<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> seventy sesterces per pound.There are numerous ways, however, of adulterating it, a sourceof considerable plunder to the company.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span></p><p>For there is, in fact, another kind<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> of minium, found in mostsilver-mines as well as lead-mines, and prepared by the calcinationof certain stones that are found mixed with the metallicvein—not the minerals, however, to the fluid humours ofwhich we have given<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> the name of quicksilver; for if those aresubjected to the action of fire they will yield silver—but anotherkind of stone<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> that is found with them. These barren<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> stones,too, may be recognized by their uniform leaden colour, and itis only when in the furnace that they turn red. After beingduly calcined they are pulverized, and thus form a minium ofsecond-rate quality, known to but very few, and far inferiorto the produce of the native sand that we have mentioned.<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>It is with this substance, then, as also with syricum, thatthe genuine minium is adulterated in the manufactories of thecompany. How syricum is prepared we shall describe in theappropriate place.<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> One motive, however, for giving an under-coatof syricum to minium, is the evident saving of expensethat results therefrom. Minium, too, in another way affords avery convenient opportunity to painters for pilfering, by wash-<pb n="6123" />ing their brushes,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> filled with the colouring matter, every nowand then. The minium of course falls to the bottom, and isthus so much gained by the thief.</p><p>Genuine minium ought to have the brilliant colour of thekermes berry;<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> but when that of inferior quality is used forwalls, the brightness of it is sure to be tarnished by themoisture, and this too, although the substance itself is a sortof metallic mildew. In the mines of Sisapo, the veins arecomposed exclusively of the sandy particles of minium, withoutthe intermixture of any silver whatever; the practice beingto melt it like gold. Minium is assayed by the agency of goldin a state of incandescence: if it has been adulterated, it willturn black, but if genuine, it retains its colour. I find itstated also that minium is adulterated with line; the propermode of detecting which, is similarly to employ a sheet of redhot iron, if there should happen to be no gold at hand.</p><p>To objects painted with minium the action of the sun andmoon is highly injurious. The proper method of avoidingthis inconvenience, is to dry the wall, and then to apply, witha hair brush, hot Punic wax, melted with oil; after which,the varnish must be heated, with an application of gall-nuts,burnt to a red heat, till it quite perspires. This done, it mustbe smoothed down with rollers<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> made of wax, and then polishedwith clean linen cloths, like marble, when made to shine.Persons employed in the manufactories in preparing miniumprotect the face with masks of loose bladder-skin, in order toavoid inhaling the dust, which is highly pernicious; the coveringbeing at the same time sufficiently transparent to admit ofbeing seen through.</p><p>Minium is employed also for writing<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> in books; and theletters made with it being more distinct, even on gold or marble,it is used for the inscriptions upon tombs.<pb n="6124" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. vi. cc. 27, 28, 32.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. iii. c. 3, Vol. I. p. 163.
