<div2 type="chapter" n="75" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 75. (73.)—WHEN AND WHERE THERE ARE NOSHADOWS.</head><p>It is likewise said, that in the town of Syene, which is5000 stadia south of Alexandria<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>, there is no shadow at noon,on the day of the solstice; and that a well, which was sunkfor the purpose of the experiment, is illuminated by the sunin every part. Hence it appears that the sun, in this place,is vertical, and Onesicritus informs us that this is the case,about the same time, in India, at the river Hypasis<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>. It iswell known, that at Berenice, a city of the Troglodytæ, and4820 stadia beyond that city, in the same country, at thetown of Ptolemais, which was built on the Red Sea, whenthe elephant was first hunted, this same thing takes placefor forty-five days before the solstice and for an equal lengthof time after it, and that during these ninety days the shadowsare turned towards the south<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>. Again, at Meroë, an islandin the Nile and the metropolis of the Æthiopians, which is5000 stadia<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> from Syene, there are no shadows at two periodsof the year, viz. when the sun is in the 18th degree of Taurusand in the 14th of Leo<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>. The Oretes, a people of India, havea mountain named Maleus<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>, near which the shadows in sum-<pb n="1108" />mer fall towards the south and in winter towards the north.The seven stars of the Great Bear are visible there for fifteennights only. In India also, in the celebrated sea-port Patale<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>, thesun rises to the right hand and the shadows falltowards the south. While Alexander was staving there itwas observed, that the seven northern stars were seen onlyduring the early part of the night<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>. Onesicritus, one of hisgenerals, informs us in his work, that in those places in Indiawhere there are no shadows, the seven stars are not visible<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>;these places, he says, are called "Ascia<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>," and the people theredo not reckon the time by hours<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This would be about 625 miles. Strabo, ii. 114, and Lucan, ii. 587,give the same distance, which is probably nearly correct. Syene is,however, a little to the north of the tropic.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This remark is not correct, as no part of this river is between thetropics. For an account of Onesicritus see Lemaire, i. 203, 204.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"In meridiem umbras jaci." M. Ajasson translates this passage, "lesombres tombent pendant quatre-vingt-dix jours sur le point central duméridien." ii. 165. But I conceive that Holland's version is more correct, "for 90 days' space all the shadows are cast into the south." i. 36.The remarks of M. Alexandre are to the same effect; ".....ut bis solemin zenitho haberet (Ptolemais), Malii mensis et Augusti initio; intereavero, solem e septemtrione haberet." Lemaire, i. 393.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">About 625 miles.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">These days correspond to the 8th of May and the 4th of Augustrespectively.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There is considerable uncertainty respecting the identity of this mountain; our author refers to it in a subsequent part of his work, where it issaid to be in the country of the Monedes and Suari; vi. 22.
