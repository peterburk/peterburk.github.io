It was in this island thatbrass first obtained celebrity for the manufacture of the feetand supports of dining-couches. After some time it cameto be employed for the statues of the gods, and the effigies ofmen and other animated beings.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Delian brass is mentioned by Cicero, in his oration "Pro RoscioAmerino," s. 46, and in his Fourth oration "In Verrem," s. 1.—B.
