<div2 type="chapter" n="67" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 67. (67.)—WHETHER THE OCEAN SURROUNDS THEEARTH.</head><p>The whole of the western ocean is now navigated, from Gadesand the Pillars of Hercules, round Spain and Gaul. Thegreater part of the northern ocean has also been navigated,under the auspices of the Emperor Augustus, his fleet havingbeen carried round Germany to the promontory of the Cimbri<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>;from which spot they descried an immense sea, or became acquaintedwith it by report, which extends to the country ofthe Scythians, and the districts that are chilled by excessivemoisture<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>. On this account it is not at all probable, thatthe ocean should be deficient in a region where moisture somuch abounds. In like manner, towards the east, from theIndian sea, all that part which lies in the same latitude<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>, andwhich bends round towards the Caspian<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, has been exploredby the Macedonian arms, in the reigns of Seleucus and Antiochus,who wished it to be named after themselves, theSeleucian or Antiochian Sea. About the Caspian, too,many partsof the shores of the ocean have been explored, so that nearlythe whole of the north has been sailed over in one directionor another. Nor can our argument be much affected by thepoint that has been so much discussed, respecting the PalusMæotis, whether it be a bay of the same ocean<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>, as is, Iunderstand, the opinion of some persons, or whether it be theoverflowing of a narrow channel connected with a differentocean<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>. On the other side of Gades, proceeding fromthe same western point, a great part of the southern ocean,<pb n="1099" />along Mauritania, has now been navigated. Indeed thegreater part of this region, as well as of the east, as far as theArabian Gulf, was surveyed in consequence of Alexander'svictories. When Caius Cæsar, the son of Augustus<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>, had theconduct of affairs in that country, it is said that they found theremains of Spanish vessels which had been wrecked there.While the power of Carthage was at its height, Hanno published anaccount of a voyage which he made from Gades tothe extremity of Arabia<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>; Himilco was also sent, about thesame time, to explore the remote parts of Europe. Besides,we learn from Corn. Nepos, that one Eudoxus, a contemporaryof his<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>, when he was flying from king Lathyrus, set out fromthe Arabian Gulf, and was carried as far as Gades<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>. And longbefore him, Cælius Antipater<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> informs us, that he had seena person who had sailed from Spain to Æthiopia for the purposes oftrade. The same Cornelius Nepos, when speaking ofthe northern circumnavigation, tells us that Q. Metellus Celer,the colleague of L. Afranius in the consulship, but then aproconsul in Gaul<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>, had a present made to him by the kingof the Suevi, of certain Indians, who sailing from India forthe purpose of commerce, had been driven by tempests intoGermany<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>. Thus it appears, that the seas which flow com-<pb n="1100" />pletely round the globe, and divide it, as it were, into twoparts<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>, exclude us from one part of it, as there is no way opento it on either side. And as the contemplation of thesethings is adapted to detect the vanity of mortals, it seemsincumbent on me to display, and lay open to our eyes, thewhole of it, whatever it be, in which there is nothing whichcan satisfy the desires of certain individuals.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The voyage which is here alluded to was probably that performedby Drusus; it is mentioned by Dio, lib. iv., Suetonius, Claud. § 1, Vel.Paterculus, ii. 106, and by Tacitus, Germ. § 34.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">What is here spoken of we may presume to have been that part ofthe German Ocean which lies to the N.W. of Denmark; the term Scythian was applied by the ancients in so very general a way, as not toafford any indication of the exact district so designated.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Sub eodem sidere;" "which lies under the same star."</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The ancients conceived the Caspian to be a gulf, connected withthe northern ocean.
