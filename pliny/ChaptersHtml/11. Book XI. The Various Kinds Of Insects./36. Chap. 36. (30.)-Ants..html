<div2 type="chapter" n="36" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 36. (30.)ÑANTS.</head><p>The greater part of the insects produce a maggot. Ants alsoproduce one in spring, which is similar to an egg,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and they<pb n="3038" />work in common, like bees; but whereas the last make their food,the former only store<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> it away. If a person only compares theburdens which the ants carry with the size of their bodies, hemust confess that there is no animal which, in proportion, ispossessed of a greater degree of strength. These burdens theycarry with the mouth, but when it is too large to admit ofthat, they turn their backs to it, and push it onwards withtheir feet, while they use their utmost energies with their shoulders. These insects, also, have a political community amongthemselves, and are possessed of both memory and foresight.They gnaw each grain before they lay it by, for fear lest itshould shoot while under ground; those grains, again, whichare too large for admission, they divide at the entrance of theirholes; and those which have become soaked by the rain, theybring out and dry.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> They work, too, by night, during thefull moon; but when there is no moon, they cease working.And then, too, in their labours, what ardour they display,what wondrous carefulness! Because they collect their storesfrom different quarters, in ignorance of the proceedings of oneanother, they have certain days set apart for holding a kind ofmarket, on which they meet together and take stock.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> What vastthrongs are then to be seen hurrying together, what anxiousenquiries appear to be made, and what earnest parleys<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> aregoing on among them as they meet! We see even the verystones worn away by their footsteps, and roads beaten downby being the scene of their labours. Let no one be in doubt,then, how much assiduity and application, even in the veryhumblest of objects, can upon every occasion effect! Ants arethe only living beings, besides man, that bestow burial on thedead. In Sicily there are no winged ants to be found.</p><p>(31.) The horns of an Indian ant, suspended in the temple<pb n="3039" />of Hercules, at Erythr¾,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> have been looked upon as quitemiraculous for their size. This ant excavates gold from holes,in a country in the north of India, the inhabitants of which areknown as the Dard¾. It has the colour of a cat, and is insize as large as an Egyptian wolf.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> This gold, which it extracts in the winter, is taken by the Indians during the heatsof summer, while the ants are compelled, by the excessivewarmth, to hide themselves in their holes. Still, however,on being aroused by catching the scent of the Indians, theysally forth, and frequently tear them to pieces, though provided with the swiftest camels for the purpose of flight; sogreat is their fleetness, combined with their ferocity and theirpassion for gold!</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">What are commonly called ants' eggs, are in reality their larv¾ andnymph¾. Enveloped in a sort of tunic, these last, Cuvier says, are likegrains of corn, and from this probably has arisen the story that they lay up grains against the winter, a period through which in reality they donot eat.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">They stow away bits of meat and detached portions of fruit, to nourishtheir larv¾ with their juices.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is in reality their larv¾ that they thus bring out to dry. Theworking ants, or neutrals, are the ones on which these labours devolve;the males and females are winged, the working ants are without wings.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Ad recognitionem mutuam."</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Some modern writers express an opinion that when they meet, theyconverse and encourage one another by the medium of touch and smell.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. v. c. 31.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">M. de Veltheim thinks that by this is really meant the Canis corsac,the small fox of India, but that by some mistake it was represented bytravellers as an ant. It is not improbable, Cuvier says, that some quadruped, in making holes in the ground, may have occasionally thrown up somegrains of the precious metal. The story is derived from the narrativesof Clearchus and Megasthenes. Another interpretation of this story hasalso been suggested. We find from some remarks of Mr. Wilson, in the<hi rend="ital">Transactions of the Asiatic Society,</hi> on the Mahabharata, a Sanscrit poem,that various tribes on the mountains Meru and Mandara (supposed to liebetween Hindostan and Tibet) used to sell grains of gold, which theycalled <hi rend="ital">paippilaka,</hi> or "ant-gold," which, they said, was thrown up by ants,in Sanscrit called <hi rend="ital">pippilaka.</hi> In travelling westward, this story, in itself,no doubt, untrue, may very probably have been magnified to its presentdimensions.</p></body>
