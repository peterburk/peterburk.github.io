(41.)—THE INSTINCTS OF BIRDS—THE CARDUELIS,THE TAURUS, THE ANTHUS.</head><p>The farm-yard fowls have also a certain notion of religion;upon laying an egg they shudder all over, and then shake theirfeathers; after which they turn round and purify<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> themselves,or else hallow<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> themselves and their eggs with some stalk orother. (42.) The carduelis,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> which is the very smallest birdof any, will do what it is bid, not only with the voice but withthe feet as well, and with the beak, which serves it instead ofhands. There is one bird, found in the territory of Arelate, thatimitates the lowing of oxen, from which circumstance it hasreceived the name of "taurus."<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> In other respects it is ofsmall size. Another bird, called the "anthus,"<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> imitates theneighing of the horse; upon being driven from the pasture bythe approach of the horses, it will mimic their voices-and thisis the method it takes of revenging itself.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">By nestling in the dust.
