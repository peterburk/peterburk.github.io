<div2 type="chapter" n="39" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 39. (7.)—THE VARIOUS KINDS OF SALT; THE METHODS OFPREPARING IT, AND THE REMEDIES DERIVED FROM IT. TWOHUNDRED AND FOUR OBSERVATIONS THERE UPON.</head><p>All salt is either native or artificial;<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> both kinds beingformed in various ways, but produced from one of these twocauses, the condensation or the desiccation, of a liquid.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> TheLake of Tarentum is dried up by the heat of the summer sun,and the whole of its waters, which are at no time very deep,not higher than the knee in fact, are changed into once massof salt. The same, too, with a lake in Sicily, Cocanicus byname, and another in the vicinity of Gela. But in the case ofthese two last, it is only the sides<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> that are thus dried up:whereas in Phrygia, in Cappadocia, and at Aspendus, wherethe same phænomena are observable, the water is dried up toa much larger extent, to the very middle of the lake, in fact.There is also another marvellous<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> circumstance connected withthis last—however much salt is taken out of it in the day, itsplace is supplied again during the night. Every kind of lake-salt is found in grains, and not in the form of blocks.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span></p><p>Sea-water, again, spontaneously produces another kind ofsalt, from the foam which it leaves on shore at high-watern-ark, or adhering to rocks; this being, in all cases, condensedby the action of the sun, and that<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> salt being the most pun-gent of the two which is found upon the rocks.</p><p>There are also three different kinds of native salt. In Bac-triana there arc two vast lakes;<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> one of them situate on the side<pb n="5501" />of Scythia, the other on that of Ariana, both of which throwup vast quantities of salt.<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> So, too, at Citium, in Cyprus; and,in the vicinity of Memphis, they extract salt from the lakeand dry it in the sun. The surface-waters of some rivers, also,condense<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> in the form of salt, the rest of the stream flowingbeneath, as though under a crust of ice; such as the runningwaters near the Caspian Gates<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> for instance, which are knownas the "Rivers of Salt." The same is the case, too, in the vicinity of the Mardi and of the people of Armenia. In Bactriana,also, the rivers Ochus<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> and Oxus carry down from the mountains on their banks, fragments of salt. There are also inAfrica some lakes, the waters of which are turbid, that areproductive of salt. Some hot springs, too, produce salt-thoseat Pagasæ for example. Such, then, are the various kinds ofsalt produced spontaneously by water.</p><p>There are certain mountains, also, formed of native salt; thatof Oromenus, in India, for example, where it is cut out likeblocks from a quarry, and is continually reproduced, bringingin a larger revenue to the sovereigns of those countries thanthat arising from their gold and pearls. In some instancesit is dug out of the earth, being formed there, evidently, bythe condensation of the moisture, as in Cappadocia for example,where it is cut in sheets, like those of mirror-stone.<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> Theblocks of it are very heavy, the name commonly given to thembeing "mica."<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> At Gerrhæ,<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> a city of Arabia, the rampartsand houses are constructed of blocks of salt, which are soldered together by being moistened with water. King Ptole-mæs discovered salt also in the vicinity of Pelusium, whenhe encamped there; a circumstance which induced other persons to seek and discover it in the scorched tracts that liebetween Egypt and Arabia, beneath the sand. In the same<pb n="5502" />manner, too, it has been found in the thirsting deserts ofAfrica, as far as the oracle of Hammon,<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> a locality in whichthe salt increases at night with the increase of the moon.</p><p>The districts of Cyrenaica are ennobled, too, by the productionof hammoniacum,<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> a salt so called from the fact of its beingfound beneath the sands<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> there. It is similar in colour to thealum known as "schiston,"<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> and consists of long pieces, by nomeans transparent, and of an unpleasant flavour, but highlyuseful in medicine; that being held in the highest esteem,which is the clearest and divides into straight<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> flakes. Thereis one remarkable fact mentioned in connexion with it: so longas it lies under ground in its bed<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> it is extremely light, but themoment it is exposed to the light, it is hardly credible to whatan extent its weight is increased. The reason for this is evident:<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> the humid vapours of the excavations bear the massesupwards, as water does, and so aid the workmen. It is adulterated with the Sicilian salt which we have mentioned as beingfound in Lake Cocanicus, as also with that of Cyprus, whichis marvellously like it. At Egelasta,<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> in Nearer Spain, thereis a salt, hewn from the bed in almost transparent blocks, andto which for this long time past most medical men, it is said,have given the preference over all other salt. Every spot in<pb n="5503" />which salt<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span> is found is naturally barren, and produces nothing.Such are the particulars, in general, which have been ascertained with reference to native salt.</p><p>Of artificial salt there are several kinds; the common salt,and the most abundant, being made from sea-water drainedinto salt-pans, and accompanied with streams of fresh water;but it is rain more particularly, and, above all things, the sun,that aids in its formation; indeed without this last it wouldnever dry. In the neighbourhood of Utica, in Africa, they buildup masses of salt, like hills in appearance; and when these havebeen hardened by the action of the sun and moon, no moisturewill ever melt them, and iron can hardly divide them. InCrete, however, salt is made without the aid of fresh water,and merely by introducing sea-water into the salt-pans. Onthe shores of Egypt, salt is formed by the overflow of the seaupon the land, already prepared for its reception, in my opinion,by the emanations of the river Nilus. It is made here, also,from the water<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span> of certain wells, discharged into salt-pans. AtBabylon, the result of the first condensation is a bituminous<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span>liquid, like oil, which is used for burning in lamps; when thisis skimmed off, the salt is found beneath. In Cappadocia,also, both well and spring-water are introduced into the saltpans. In Chaonia there is a spring, from the water of which,when boiled<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span> and left to cool, there is an inert salt obtained,not so white as ordinary salt. In the Gallic provinces andin Germany, it is the practice to pour salt-water upon burningwood.<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Sal fit." This expression is not correct, there being no such thingas <hi rend="ital">made</hi> salt. It is only collected from a state of suspension or dissolution.Pliny, however, includes under the name "sal" many substances, whichin reality are <hi rend="ital">not</hi> salt. His "hammoniacum" for instance if identicalwith hydrochlorate of ammonia, can with justice be said to <hi rend="ital">made,</hi> beingformed artificially from other substances.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Catco humere vel siccato." These two terms in reality imply thesame process, by the medium of evaporation; the former perfect, the latterimperfect.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The evaporation not being sufficiently strong to dry up the deeper parts.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There is in reality nothing wonderful in this, considering' that mostlakes are constantly fed with the streams of rivers, which carry mineral sailsalong with them, and that the work of evaporation is always going on.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Glæbas."</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Because it is necessarily purer than that found upon the sand.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The description is not sufficiently clear to enable us to identify theselakes with certainty. Ajasson,, thinks that one of them may be the Lakeof Badakandir in the Khanat of Bokhara; and the other the lake that liesbetween Ankhio and Akeha, in the west of the territory of Balkh, and nearthe Usbek Tartars.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Sale exæstuant."</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In consequence of the intense heat.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">All these regions, Ajasson remarks, are covered with salt. An immense desert of salt extends to the north-east of Irak-Adjemi, and to thenorth of Kerman, between Tabaristan, western Khoraclu, and Khohistan.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Identified by Ajasson with the Herat and the Djihioun. He thinksthat it is of some of the small affluents of this last that Pliny speaks.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Lapis specularis."</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A "crumb" properly, in the Latin language.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. vi. c. 32.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">More commonly known as Jupiter Hammon.</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xii. c. 49, and B. xxiv. c. 28, for an account of gum resin am-moniac, a produce of the same locality. The substance here spoken of isconsidered by Beckmann to be nothing but common salt in an impure state.See his <hi rend="ital">Hist. Inv.</hi> Vol. II. pp. 398–9, where this passage is discussed atconsiderable length. Ajasson, on the other hand, considers it to be Hydrochlorate of ammonia, the Sal ammoniac of commerce. According to someaccounts, it was originally made in the vicinity of the Temple of JupiterHammon, by burning camels' dung.</p><p><span id="note_17"><a href="#ref_17">17. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Called <foreign lang="greek">a)/mmos,</foreign> in Greek.</p><p><span id="note_18"><a href="#ref_18">18. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxxv. c. 52.</p><p><span id="note_19"><a href="#ref_19">19. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Sal ammoniac crystallizes in octahedrons.</p><p><span id="note_20"><a href="#ref_20">20. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Intra specus suos." On this passage, Beckmann says, "From whatis said by Pliny it may with certainty be concluded that this salt was dugup from pits or mines in Africa.——Many kinds of rock-salt, taken fromthe mines of Wieliczka, experience the same change in the air; so thatblocks which a labourer can easily carry in the mine, can scarcely be liftedby him after being for some time exposed to the air. The cause here isundoubtedly the same as that which makes many kinds of artificial salt tobecome most and to acquire more weight."—Vol. II. p. 399, <hi rend="ital">Bohn's Ed.</hi></p><p><span id="note_21"><a href="#ref_21">21. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">According to modern notions, his reason is anything but <hi rend="ital">evident.</hi></p><p><span id="note_22"><a href="#ref_22">22. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In Celtiberia. He alludes to the mountain of salt at Cardona, nearMontserrat in Catalonia.</p><p><span id="note_23"><a href="#ref_23">23. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Speaking generally, this is true; but soils which contain it in smallquantities as fruitful.</p><p><span id="note_24"><a href="#ref_24">24. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A simile method is still employed, Ajasson says, at the salt-mines nearInnspruck in the Tyrol.</p><p><span id="note_25"><a href="#ref_25">25. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Native bitumen; always to be found in greater or less quantities, insaliferous earns.</p><p><span id="note_26"><a href="#ref_26">26. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The process of artificial evaporation.</p><p><span id="note_27"><a href="#ref_27">27. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This would produce an impure alkaline salt. According to Townson,this practice sll prevails in Transylvania and Moldavia.</p></body>
