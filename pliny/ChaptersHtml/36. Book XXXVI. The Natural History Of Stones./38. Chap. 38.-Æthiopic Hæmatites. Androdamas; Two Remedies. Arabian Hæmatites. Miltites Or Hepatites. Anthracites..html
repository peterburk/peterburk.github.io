<div2 type="chapter" n="38" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 38.—ÆTHIOPIC HÆMATITES. ANDRODAMAS; TWO REMEDIES.ARABIAN HÆMATITES. MILTITES OR HEPATITES. ANTHRACITES.</head><p>Sotacus, one of the most ancient writers, says, that there arefive kinds of hæmatites, in addition to the magnet<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> so called.He gives the preference among them to that of Æthiopia,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> avery useful ingredient in ophthalmic preparations and the compositionswhich he calls "panchresta,"<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and good for the cure ofburns. The second, he says, is called "androdamas,"<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> of ablack<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> colour, remarkable for its weight and hardness, to whichit owes its name, in fact, and found in Africa more particularly.It attracts silver, he says, copper, and iron, and is tested witha touchstone made of basanites.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> It yields a liquid the colourof blood, and is an excellent remedy for diseases of the liver.The third kind that he mentions is the hæmatites<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> of Arabia, amineral of equal hardness, and which with difficulty yields,upon the water-whetstone, a liquid sometimes approaching thetint of saffron. The fourth<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> kind, he says, is known as "hepa-<pb n="6364" />tites,"<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> while raw, and as "miltites"<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> when calcined; a substancegood for burns, and more efficacious than rubrica<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> for allthe purposes for which that mineral is employed. The fifth<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>variety is schistos; a substance which, taken internally, arrestshæmorrhoidal discharges. Upon the same authority, it is recommendedto take any kind of hæmatites, fasting, in doses ofthree drachmæ, triturated in oil, for affections of the blood.<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span></p><p>The same author mentions also a kind of schistos which has noaffinity to hæmatites, and to which he gives the name of "anthracites,"<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>It is a native of Africa, he says, and is of ablack colour. When rubbed upon a water-whetstone, it yieldsa black colour on the side which has adhered to the earth, and,on the opposite side, a saffron tint. He states also that it is auseful ingredient in ophthalmic preparations.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Mentioned in Chapter 25 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Mentioned also in Chapter 25.

Ajassonthinks that it includes compact or massive red oxide of iron, and scaly rediron, or red iron froth, which leaves red marks upon the fingers.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See Chapter 11 of this Book. Its alleged attraction of silver andcopper is fabulous, no doubt.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is probably the Limonite, or Hydrous peroxide of iron, mentionedin the preceding Chapter. See Note 70 above.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Identified by Ajasson with Red ochre, or Reddle, a red peroxide ofiron, used for red crayons in drawing.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Liver-stone."
