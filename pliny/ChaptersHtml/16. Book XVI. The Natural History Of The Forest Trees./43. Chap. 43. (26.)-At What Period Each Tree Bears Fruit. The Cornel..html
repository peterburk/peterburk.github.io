<div2 type="chapter" n="43" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 43. (26.)ÑAT WHAT PERIOD EACH TREE BEARS FRUIT.THE CORNEL.</head><p>Upon some trees the fruit does not follow immediately uponthe fall of the blossom. The cornel<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> about the summer solstice puts forth a fruit that is white at first, and after thatthe colour of blood. The female<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> of this tree, after autumn,bears a sour berry, which no animal will touch; its wood,too, is spongy and quite useless, while, on the other hand, thatof the male tree is one of the very strongest and hardest<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> woodsknown: so great a difference do we find in trees belonging tothe same species. The terebinth, the maple, and the ash produce their seed at harvest-time, while the nut-trees, the apple,and the pear, with the exception of the winter or the moreearly kinds, bear fruit in autumn. The glandiferous treesbear at a still later period, the setting of the Vergili¾,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> withthe exception of the ¾sculus,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> which bears in the autumn only;while some kinds of the apple and the pear, and the cork-tree,bear fruit at the beginning of winter.</p><p>The fir puts forth blossoms of a saffron colour about thesummer solstice, and the seed is ripe just after the setting ofthe Vergili¾. The pine and the pitch-tree germinate aboutfifteen days before the fir, but their seed is not ripe till afterthe setting of the Vergili¾.<pb n="3385" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Cornus mas of botanists; probably the Frutex sanguineus mentioned in c. 30.
