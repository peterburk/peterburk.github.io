<div2 type="chapter" n="38" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 38.—SUET.</head><p>Corresponding with the grease of the swine, is the suet<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> thatis found in the ruminating animals, a substance employed inother ways, but no less efficacious in its properties. The proper mode of preparing it, in all cases, is to take out the veinsand to rinse it in sea or salt-water, after which it is beaten upin a mortar, with a sprinkling of sea-water in it. This done,it is boiled in several waters, until, in fact, it has lost all smell,and is then bleached by continual exposure to the sun; that ofthe most esteemed quality being the fat which grows about thekidneys. In case stale suet is required for any medicinal purpose, it is recommended to melt it first, and then to wash it incold water several times; after which, it must again be meltedwith a sprinkling of the most aromatic wine that can be pro-<pb n="5327" />cured, it being then boiled again and again, until the ranksmell has totally disappeared.</p><p>Many persons recommend that the fat of bulls, lions, panthers, and camels, in particular, should be thus prepared. Asto the various uses to which these substances are applied, weshall mention them on the appropriate occasions.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Sebum"—Suet or tallow.</p></body>
