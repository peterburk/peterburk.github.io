<div2 type="chapter" n="19" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 19.—AN ACCOUNT OF THE MOST CELEBRATED WORKS INBRASS, AND OF THE ARTISTS, 366 IN NUMBER.</head><p>An almost innumerable multitude of artists have been renderedfamous by their statues and figures of smaller size.Before all others is Phidias,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> the Athenian, who executed theJupiter at Olympia, in ivory and gold,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> but who also madefigures in brass as well. He flourished in the eighty-thirdOlympiad, about the year of our City, 300. To the same agebelong also his rivals Alcamenes,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> Critias,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> Nesiotes,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> andHegias.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> Afterwards, in the eighty-seventh Olympiad, therewere Agelades,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> Callon,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> and Gorgias the Laconian. In theninetieth Olympiad there were Polycletus,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> Phradmon,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>Myron,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> Pythagoras,<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> Scopas,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> and Perellus.<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> Of these,Polycletus had for pupils, Argius,<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> Asopodorus, Alexis,Aristides,<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> Phrynon, Dinon, Athenodorus,<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> and Demeas<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> the<pb n="6169" />Clitorian: Lycius,<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> too, was the pupil of Myron. In theninety-fifth Olympiad flourished Naucsydes,<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> Dinomenes,<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span>Canachus,<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> and Patroclus.<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span> In the hundred and secondOlympiad there were Polycles,<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span> Cephisodotus,<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span> Leochares,<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span>and Hypatodorus.<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span> In the hundred and fourth Olympiad,flourished Praxiteles<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span> and Euphranor;<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span> in the hundred andseventh, Aëtion<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span> and Therimachus;<span id="ref_31"><a href="#note_31">[31]</a></span> in the hundred andthirteenth, Lysippus,<span id="ref_32"><a href="#note_32">[32]</a></span> who was the contemporary of Alexanderthe Great, his brother Lysistratus,<span id="ref_33"><a href="#note_33">[33]</a></span> Sthennis,<span id="ref_34"><a href="#note_34">[34]</a></span> Euphron,Eucles, Sostratus,<span id="ref_35"><a href="#note_35">[35]</a></span> Ion, and Silanion,<span id="ref_36"><a href="#note_36">[36]</a></span> who was remarkable for<pb n="6170" />having acquired great celebrity without any instructor:Zeuxis<span id="ref_37"><a href="#note_37">[37]</a></span> was his pupil. In the hundred and twenty-firstOlympiad were Eutychides,<span id="ref_38"><a href="#note_38">[38]</a></span> Euthycrates,<span id="ref_39"><a href="#note_39">[39]</a></span> Laïppus,<span id="ref_40"><a href="#note_40">[40]</a></span> Cephisodotus,<span id="ref_41"><a href="#note_41">[41]</a></span>Timarchus,<span id="ref_42"><a href="#note_42">[42]</a></span> and Pyromachus.<span id="ref_43"><a href="#note_43">[43]</a></span></p><p>The practice of this art then ceased for some time, butrevived in the hundred and fifty-sixth Olympiad, when therewere some artists, who, though far inferior to those already mentioned,were still highly esteemed; Antæus, Callistratus,<span id="ref_44"><a href="#note_44">[44]</a></span> Polycles,<span id="ref_45"><a href="#note_45">[45]</a></span>Athenæus,<span id="ref_46"><a href="#note_46">[46]</a></span> Callixenus, Pythocles, Pythias, and Timocles.<span id="ref_47"><a href="#note_47">[47]</a></span></p><p>The ages of the most celebrated artists being thus distinguished,I shall cursorily review the more eminent of them,the greater part being mentioned in a desultory manner. Themost celebrated of these artists, though born at differentepochs, have joined in a trial of skill in the Amazons whichthey have respectively made. When these statues were dedicatedin the Temple of Diana at Ephesus, it was agreed, inorder to ascertain which was the best, that it should be left tothe judgment of the artists themselves who were then present:upon which, it was evident that that was the best, which allthe artists agreed in considering as the next best to his own.Accordingly, the first rank was assigned to Polycletus, thesecond to Phidias, the third to Cresilas, the fourth to Cydon,and the fifth to Phradmon.<span id="ref_48"><a href="#note_48">[48]</a></span><pb n="6171" /></p><p>Phidias, besides the Olympian Jupiter, which no one hasever equalled, also executed in ivory the erect statue ofMinerva, which is in the Parthenon at Athens.<span id="ref_49"><a href="#note_49">[49]</a></span> He alsomade in brass, beside the Amazon above mentioned,<span id="ref_50"><a href="#note_50">[50]</a></span> a Minerva,of such exquisite beauty, that it received its name from its fineproportions.<span id="ref_51"><a href="#note_51">[51]</a></span> He also made the Cliduchus,<span id="ref_52"><a href="#note_52">[52]</a></span> and anotherMinerva, which Paulus Æmilius dedicated at Rome in theTemple of Fortune<span id="ref_53"><a href="#note_53">[53]</a></span> of the passing day. Also the two statues,draped with the pallium, which Catulus erected in the sametemple; and a nude colossal statue. Phidias is deservedlyconsidered to have discovered and developed the toreutic art.<span id="ref_54"><a href="#note_54">[54]</a></span></p><p>Polycletus of Sicyon,<span id="ref_55"><a href="#note_55">[55]</a></span> the pupil of Agelades, executedthe Diadumenos,<span id="ref_56"><a href="#note_56">[56]</a></span> the statue of an effeminate youth, andremarkable for having cost one hundred talents; as alsothe statue of a youth full of manly vigour, and called theDoryphoros.<span id="ref_57"><a href="#note_57">[57]</a></span> He also made what the artists have called theModel statue,<span id="ref_58"><a href="#note_58">[58]</a></span> and from which, as from a sort of standard,<pb n="6172" />they study the lineaments: so that he, of all men, is thought inone work of art to have exhausted all the resources of art.He also made statues of a man using the body-scraper,<span id="ref_59"><a href="#note_59">[59]</a></span> andof a naked man challenging to play at dice;<span id="ref_60"><a href="#note_60">[60]</a></span> as also of twonaked boys playing at dice, and known as the Astragalizontes;<span id="ref_61"><a href="#note_61">[61]</a></span>they are now in the atrium of the Emperor Titus, and it is generallyconsidered, that there can be no work more perfect thanthis. He also executed a Mercury, which was formerly at Lysimachia;a Hercules Ageter,<span id="ref_62"><a href="#note_62">[62]</a></span> seizing his arms, which is now atRome; and an Artemon, which has received the name ofPeriphoretos.<span id="ref_63"><a href="#note_63">[63]</a></span> Polycletus is generally considered as havingattained the highest excellence in statuary, and as having perfectedthe toreutic<span id="ref_64"><a href="#note_64">[64]</a></span> art, which Phidias invented. A discoverywhich was entirely his own, was the art of placing statues onone leg. It is remarked, however, by Varro, that his statuesare all square-built,<span id="ref_65"><a href="#note_65">[65]</a></span> and made very much after the samemodel.<span id="ref_66"><a href="#note_66">[66]</a></span><pb n="6173" /></p><p>Myron of Eleutheræ,<span id="ref_67"><a href="#note_67">[67]</a></span> who was also the pupil of Agelades,was rendered more particularly famous by his statue of aheifer,<span id="ref_68"><a href="#note_68">[68]</a></span> celebrated in many well-known lines: so true is it,that most men owe their renown more to the genius of others,than to their own. He also made the figure of a dog,<span id="ref_69"><a href="#note_69">[69]</a></span> aDiscobolus,<span id="ref_70"><a href="#note_70">[70]</a></span> a Perseus,<span id="ref_71"><a href="#note_71">[71]</a></span> the Pristæ,<span id="ref_72"><a href="#note_72">[72]</a></span> a Satyr<span id="ref_73"><a href="#note_73">[73]</a></span> admiring a flute,and a Minerva, the Delphic Pentathletes,<span id="ref_74"><a href="#note_74">[74]</a></span> the Pancratiastæ,<span id="ref_75"><a href="#note_75">[75]</a></span>and a Hercules,<span id="ref_76"><a href="#note_76">[76]</a></span> which is at the Circus Maximus, in the houseof Pompeius Magnus. Erinna,<span id="ref_77"><a href="#note_77">[77]</a></span> in her poems,<span id="ref_78"><a href="#note_78">[78]</a></span> makes allusionto a monument which he erected to a cricket and a locust.He also executed the Apollo, which, after being taken from theEphesians by the Triumvir Antonius, was restored by theEmperor Augustus, he having been admonished to do so in adream. Myron appears to have been the first to give a varieddevelopment to the art,<span id="ref_79"><a href="#note_79">[79]</a></span> having made a greater number ofdesigns than Polycletus, and shewn more attention to symmetry.And yet, though he was very accurate in the proportionsof his figures, he has neglected to give expression;besides which, he has not treated the hair and the pubes with<pb n="6174" />any greater attention than is observed in the rude figures ofmore ancient times.</p><p>Pythagoras of Rhegium, in Italy, excelled him in the figureof the Pancratiast<span id="ref_80"><a href="#note_80">[80]</a></span> which is now at Delphi, and in which healso surpassed Leontiscus.<span id="ref_81"><a href="#note_81">[81]</a></span> Pythagoras also executed the statueof Astylos,<span id="ref_82"><a href="#note_82">[82]</a></span> the runner, which is exhibited at Olympia; thatof a Libyan boy holding a tablet, also in the same place; anda nude male figure holding fruit. There is at Syracuse afigure of a lame man by him: persons, when looking at it,seem to feel the very pain of his wound. He also made anApollo, with the serpent<span id="ref_83"><a href="#note_83">[83]</a></span> pierced by his arrows; and a Playeron the Lyre, known as the Dicæus,<span id="ref_84"><a href="#note_84">[84]</a></span> from the fact that, whenThebes was taken by Alexander the Great, a fugitive successfullyconcealed in its bosom a sum of gold. He was the first artistwho gave expression to the sinews and the veins, and paidmore attention to the hair.</p><p>There was also another Pythagoras, a Samian,<span id="ref_85"><a href="#note_85">[85]</a></span> who wasoriginally a painter, seven of whose nude figures, in theTemple of Fortune of the passing day,<span id="ref_86"><a href="#note_86">[86]</a></span> and one of an agedman, are very much admired. He is said to have resembledthe last-mentioned artist so much in his features, that theycould not be distinguished. Sostratus, it is said, was thepupil of Pythagoras of Rhegium, and his sister's son.</p><p>According to Duris,<span id="ref_87"><a href="#note_87">[87]</a></span> Lysippus the Sicyonian was not thepupil<span id="ref_88"><a href="#note_88">[88]</a></span> of any one, but was originally a worker in brass, andwas first prompted to venture upon statuary by an answer thatwas given by Eupompus the painter; who, upon being askedwhich of his predecessors he proposed to take for his model,pointed to a crowd of men, and replied that it was Nature herself,<pb n="6175" />and no artist, that he proposed to imitate. As already mentioned,<span id="ref_89"><a href="#note_89">[89]</a></span>Lysippus was most prolific in his works, and made morestatues than any other artist. Among these, is the Man using theBody-scraper, which Marcus Agrippa had erected in front of hisWarm Baths,<span id="ref_90"><a href="#note_90">[90]</a></span> and which wonderfully pleased the EmperorTiberius. This prince, although in the beginning of his reignhe imposed some restraint upon himself, could not resist thetemptation, and had this statue removed to his bed-chamber,having substituted another for it at the baths: the people,however, were so resolutely opposed to this, that at the theatrethey clamourously demanded the Apoxyomenos<span id="ref_91"><a href="#note_91">[91]</a></span> to be replaced;and the prince, notwithstanding his attachment to it, wasobliged to restore it.</p><p>Lysippus is also celebrated for his statue of the intoxicatedFemale Flute-player, his dogs and huntsmen, and, more particularly,for his Chariot with the Sun, as represented by theRhodians.<span id="ref_92"><a href="#note_92">[92]</a></span> He also executed a numerous series of statues ofAlexander the Great, commencing from his childhood.<span id="ref_93"><a href="#note_93">[93]</a></span> TheEmperor Nero was so delighted with his statue of the infantAlexander, that he had it gilt: this addition, however, to itsvalue, so detracted from its artistic beauty that the gold wasremoved, and in this state it was looked upon as still moreprecious, though disfigured by the scratches and seams whichremained upon it, and in which the gold was still to be seen.<span id="ref_94"><a href="#note_94">[94]</a></span>He also made the statue of Hephæstion, the friend of Alexanderthe Great, which some persons attribute to Polycletus,whereas that artist lived nearly a century before his time.<span id="ref_95"><a href="#note_95">[95]</a></span>Also, the statue of Alexander at the chase, now consecrated atDelphi, the figure of a Satyr, now at Athens, and the Squadron<span id="ref_96"><a href="#note_96">[96]</a></span><pb n="6176" />of Alexander,<span id="ref_97"><a href="#note_97">[97]</a></span> all of whom he represented with the greatestaccuracy. This last work of art, after his conquest of Macedonia,<span id="ref_98"><a href="#note_98">[98]</a></span>Metellus conveyed to Rome. Lysippus also executedchariots of various kinds. He is considered to have contributedvery greatly to the art of statuary by expressing thedetails of the hair,<span id="ref_99"><a href="#note_99">[99]</a></span> and by making the head smaller than hadbeen done by the ancients, and the body more graceful and lessbulky, a method by which his statues were made to appeartaller. The Latin language has no appropriate name for that"symmetry,"<span id="ref_100"><a href="#note_100">[100]</a></span> which he so attentively observed in his new andhitherto untried method of modifying the squareness observablein the ancient statues. Indeed, it was a common sayingof his, that other artists made men as they actually were, whilehe made them as they appeared to be. One peculiar characteristicof his work, is the finish and minuteness which are observedin even the smallest details. Lysippus left three sons,who were also his pupils, and became celebrated as artists,Laippus, Bœdas, and, more particularly, Euthycrates; thoughthis last-named artist rivalled his father in precision ratherthan in elegance, and preferred scrupulous correctness to gracefulness.Nothing can be more expressive than his Herculesat Delphi, his Alexander, his Hunter at Thespiæ, and hisEquestrian Combat. Equally good, too, are his statue of Trophonius,erected in the oracular cave<span id="ref_101"><a href="#note_101">[101]</a></span> of that divinity, hisnumerous chariots, his Horse with the Panniers,<span id="ref_102"><a href="#note_102">[102]</a></span> and his hounds.</p><p>Tisicrates, also a native of Sicyon, was a pupil of Euthycrates,but more nearly approaching the style of Lysippus; somuch so, that several of his statues can scarcely be distinguishedfrom those of Lysippus; his aged Theban, for example, his KingDemetrius, and his Peucestes, who saved the life of Alexanderthe Great, and so rendered himself deserving of this honour.<span id="ref_103"><a href="#note_103">[103]</a></span><pb n="6177" /></p><p>Artists, who have transmitted these details in their works,bestow wonderful encomiums upon Telephanes, the Phocæan,a statuary but little known, they say, because he lived in Thessaly,where his works remained concealed; according to theiraccount, however, he is quite equal to Polycletus, Myron, andPythagoras. They more particularly commend his Larissa,his Spintharus, the pentathlete,<span id="ref_104"><a href="#note_104">[104]</a></span> and his Apollo. Others,however, assign another reason for his being so little known;it being owing, they think, to his having devoted himself tothe studios established by Kings Xerxes and Darius.</p><p>Praxiteles, who excelled more particularly in marble, andthence acquired his chief celebrity, also executed some verybeautiful works in brass, the Rape of Proserpine, the Catagusa,<span id="ref_105"><a href="#note_105">[105]</a></span>a Father Liber,<span id="ref_106"><a href="#note_106">[106]</a></span> a figure of Drunkenness, and the celebratedSatyr,<span id="ref_107"><a href="#note_107">[107]</a></span> to the Greeks known as "Periboetos."<span id="ref_108"><a href="#note_108">[108]</a></span> He also executedthe statues, which were formerly before the Temple<span id="ref_109"><a href="#note_109">[109]</a></span> of GoodFortune, and the Venus, which was destroyed by fire, withthe Temple of that goddess, in the reign of Claudius, and wasconsidered equal to his marble statue of Venus,<span id="ref_110"><a href="#note_110">[110]</a></span> so celebratedthroughout the world. He also executed a Stephanusa,<span id="ref_111"><a href="#note_111">[111]</a></span> a Spilumene,<span id="ref_112"><a href="#note_112">[112]</a></span> an Œnophorus,<span id="ref_113"><a href="#note_113">[113]</a></span> and two figures of Harmodius andAristogiton, who slew the tyrants; which last, having been takenaway from Greece by Xerxes, were restored to the Athenians on<pb n="6178" />the conquest of Persia by Alexander the Great.<span id="ref_114"><a href="#note_114">[114]</a></span> He also madethe youthful Apollo, known as the "Sauroctonos,"<span id="ref_115"><a href="#note_115">[115]</a></span> because heis aiming an arrow at a lizard which is stealing towards him.There are greatly admired, also, two statues of his, expressiveof contrary emotions—a Matron in tears, and a Courtesan fullof gaiety: this last is supposed to be a likeness of Phryne, andit is said that we can detect in her figure the love of the artist,and in the countenance of the courtesan the promised reward.<span id="ref_116"><a href="#note_116">[116]</a></span></p><p>His kindness of heart, too, is witnessed by another figure;for in a chariot and horses which had been executed by Calamis,<span id="ref_117"><a href="#note_117">[117]</a></span>he himself made the charioteer, in order that the artist,who excelled in the representation of horses, might not beconsidered deficient in the human figure. This last-mentionedartist has executed other chariots also, some with fourhorses, and some with two; and in his horses he is alwaysunrivalled. But that it may not be supposed that he was sogreatly inferior in his human figures, it is as well to remarkthat his Alcmena<span id="ref_118"><a href="#note_118">[118]</a></span> is equal to any that was ever produced.</p><p>Alcamenes,<span id="ref_119"><a href="#note_119">[119]</a></span> who was a pupil of Phidias, worked in marbleand executed a Pentathlete in brass, known as the "Encrinomenos."<span id="ref_120"><a href="#note_120">[120]</a></span>Aristides, too, who was the scholar of Polycletus,executed chariots in metal with four and two horses. The<pb n="6179" />Leæna<span id="ref_121"><a href="#note_121">[121]</a></span> of Amphicrates<span id="ref_122"><a href="#note_122">[122]</a></span> is highly commended. The courtesan<span id="ref_123"><a href="#note_123">[123]</a></span>Leæna, who was a skilful performer on the lyre, andhad so become acquainted with Harmodius and Aristogiton,submitted to be tortured till she expired, rather than betraytheir plot for the extermination of the tyrants.<span id="ref_124"><a href="#note_124">[124]</a></span> The Athenians,being desirous of honouring her memory, without atthe same time rendering homage to a courtesan, had her representedunder the figure of the animal whose name she bore;<span id="ref_125"><a href="#note_125">[125]</a></span>and, in order to indicate the cause of the honour thus paid her,ordered the artist to represent the animal without a tongue.<span id="ref_126"><a href="#note_126">[126]</a></span></p><p>Bryaxis executed in brass statues of Æsculapius and Seleucus;<span id="ref_127"><a href="#note_127">[127]</a></span>Bœdas<span id="ref_128"><a href="#note_128">[128]</a></span> a figure in adoration; Baton, an Apollo and aJuno, which are in the Temple of Concord<span id="ref_129"><a href="#note_129">[129]</a></span> at Rome.</p><p>Ctesilaüs<span id="ref_130"><a href="#note_130">[130]</a></span> executed a statue of a man fainting from hiswounds, in the expression of which may be seen how littlelife remains;<span id="ref_131"><a href="#note_131">[131]</a></span> as also the Olympian Pericles,<span id="ref_132"><a href="#note_132">[132]</a></span> well worthy ofits title: indeed, it is one of the marvellous adjuncts of thisart, that it renders men who are already celebrated even moreso.</p><p>Cephisodotus<span id="ref_133"><a href="#note_133">[133]</a></span> is the artist of an admirable Minerva, nowerected in the port of Athens; as also of the altar before the<pb n="6180" />Temple of Jupiter Servator,<span id="ref_134"><a href="#note_134">[134]</a></span> at the same place, to which,indeed, few works are comparable.</p><p>Canachus<span id="ref_135"><a href="#note_135">[135]</a></span> executed a nude Apollo, which is known as the"Philesian:"<span id="ref_136"><a href="#note_136">[136]</a></span> it is at Didymi,<span id="ref_137"><a href="#note_137">[137]</a></span> and is composed of bronzethat was fused at Ægina. He also made a stag with it, sonicely poised on its hoofs, as to admit of a thread being passedbeneath. One<span id="ref_138"><a href="#note_138">[138]</a></span> fore-foots, too, and the alternate hind-foot areso made as firmly to grip the base, the socket being<span id="ref_139"><a href="#note_139">[139]</a></span> so indentedon either side, as to admit of the figure being thrownat pleasure upon alternate feet. Another work of his was theboys known as the "Celetizontes."<span id="ref_140"><a href="#note_140">[140]</a></span></p><p>Chæreas made statues of Alexander the Great and of hisfather Philip.

Leocharesmade a bronze representing the eagle carrying off Ganymede:the eagle has all the appearance of being sensible of the importanceof his burden, and for whom he is carrying it, beingcareful not to injure the youth with his talons, even throughthe garments.<span id="ref_164"><a href="#note_164">[164]</a></span> He executed a figure, also, of Autolycus,<span id="ref_165"><a href="#note_165">[165]</a></span> whohad been victorious in the contests of the Pancratium, and forwhom Xenophon wrote his Symposium;<span id="ref_166"><a href="#note_166">[166]</a></span> the figure, also, ofJupiter Tonans in the Capitol, the most admired of all hisworks; and a statue of Apollo crowned with a diadem.

Pyromachus representedAlcibiades, managing a chariot with four horses: Polyclesmade a splendid statue of Hermaphroditus; Pyrrhus, statues ofHygeia and Minerva; and Phanis, who was a pupil of Lysippus,an Epithyusa.<span id="ref_173"><a href="#note_173">[173]</a></span></p><p>Stypax of Cyprus acquired his celebrity by a single work,the statue of the Splanchnoptes;<span id="ref_174"><a href="#note_174">[174]</a></span> which represents a slave ofthe Olympian Pericles, roasting entrails and kindling the firewith his breath. Silanion made a statue in metal of Apollodorus,who was himself a modeller, and not only the mostdiligent of all in the study of this art, but a most severecriticizer of his own works, frequently breaking his statues topieces when he had finished them, and never able to satisfyhis intense passion for the art—a circumstance which procuredhim the surname of "the Madman." Indeed, it is this expressionwhich he has given to his works, which represent inmetal embodied anger rather than the lineaments of a humanbeing. The Achilles, also, of Silanion is very excellent, andhis Epistates<span id="ref_175"><a href="#note_175">[175]</a></span> exercising the Athletes. Strongylion<span id="ref_176"><a href="#note_176">[176]</a></span> made afigure of an Amazon, which, from the beauty of the legs, wasknown as the "Eucnemos,"<span id="ref_177"><a href="#note_177">[177]</a></span> and which Nero used to have carriedabout with him in his travels. Strongylion was the artist,<pb n="6184" />also, of a youthful figure, which was so much admired byBrutus of Philippi, that it received from him its surname.<span id="ref_178"><a href="#note_178">[178]</a></span></p><p>Theodorus of Samos,<span id="ref_179"><a href="#note_179">[179]</a></span> who constructed the Labyrinth,<span id="ref_180"><a href="#note_180">[180]</a></span> casthis own statue in brass; which was greatly admired, not onlyfor its resemblance, but for the extreme delicacy of the work.In the right hand he holds a file, and with three fingers of theleft, a little model of a four-horse chariot, which has sincebeen transferred to Præneste:<span id="ref_181"><a href="#note_181">[181]</a></span> it is so extremely minute, thatthe whole piece, both chariot and charioteer, may be coveredby the wings of a fly, which he also made with it.</p><p>Xenocrates<span id="ref_182"><a href="#note_182">[182]</a></span> was the pupil of Ticrates, or, as some say, ofEuthycrates: he surpassed them both, however, in the numberof his statues, and was the author of some treatises on his art.</p><p>Several artists have represented the battles fought by Attalusand Eumenes with the Galli;<span id="ref_183"><a href="#note_183">[183]</a></span> Isigonus, for instance, Pyromachus,Stratonicus, and Antigonus,<span id="ref_184"><a href="#note_184">[184]</a></span> who also wrote someworks in reference to his art. Boëthus,<span id="ref_185"><a href="#note_185">[185]</a></span> although more celebratedfor his works in silver, has executed a beautiful figureof a child strangling a goose. The most celebrated of all theworks, of which I have here spoken, have been dedicated, forsome time past, by the Emperor Vespasianus in the Temple ofPeace,<span id="ref_186"><a href="#note_186">[186]</a></span> and other public buildings of his. They had before<pb n="6185" />been forcibly carried off by Nero,<span id="ref_187"><a href="#note_187">[187]</a></span> and brought to Rome,and arranged by him in the reception-rooms of his GoldenPalace.<span id="ref_188"><a href="#note_188">[188]</a></span></p><p>In addition to these, there are several other artists, of aboutequal celebrity, but none of whom have produced any first-rateworks; Ariston,<span id="ref_189"><a href="#note_189">[189]</a></span> who was principally employed in chasingsilver, Callides, Ctesias, Cantharus of Sicyon,<span id="ref_190"><a href="#note_190">[190]</a></span> Diodorus, apupil of Critias, Deliades, Euphorion, Eunicus,<span id="ref_191"><a href="#note_191">[191]</a></span> and Hecatæus,<span id="ref_192"><a href="#note_192">[192]</a></span>all of them chasers in silver; Lesbocles, also, Prodorus, Pythodicus,and Polygnotus,<span id="ref_193"><a href="#note_193">[193]</a></span> one of the most celebrated painters;also two other chasers in silver, Stratonicus,<span id="ref_194"><a href="#note_194">[194]</a></span> and Scymnus, apupil of Critias.</p><p>I shall now enumerate those artists who have executedworks of the same class:—Apollodorus,<span id="ref_195"><a href="#note_195">[195]</a></span> for example, Antrobulus,Asclepiodorus, and Aleuas, who have executed statuesof philosophers. Apellas<span id="ref_196"><a href="#note_196">[196]</a></span> has left us some figures of femalesin the act of adoration; Antignotus, a Perixyomenos,<span id="ref_197"><a href="#note_197">[197]</a></span> andfigures of the Tyrannicides, already mentioned. Antimachusand Athenodorus made some statues of females of noble birth;Aristodemus<span id="ref_198"><a href="#note_198">[198]</a></span> executed figures of wrestlers, two-horse chariotswith the charioteers, philosophers, aged women, and a statueof King Seleucus:<span id="ref_199"><a href="#note_199">[199]</a></span> his Doryphoros,<span id="ref_200"><a href="#note_200">[200]</a></span> too, possesses his characteristicgracefulness.</p><p>There were two artists of the name of Cephisodotus:<span id="ref_201"><a href="#note_201">[201]</a></span> the<pb n="6186" />earlier of them made a figure of Mercury nursing Father Liber<span id="ref_202"><a href="#note_202">[202]</a></span>when an infant; also of a man haranguing, with the handelevated, the original of which is now unknown. The youngerCephisodotus executed statues of philosophers. Colotes,<span id="ref_203"><a href="#note_203">[203]</a></span> whoassisted Phidias in the Olympian Jupiter, also executed statuesof philosophers; the same, too, with Cleon,<span id="ref_204"><a href="#note_204">[204]</a></span> Cenchramis,Callicles,<span id="ref_205"><a href="#note_205">[205]</a></span> and Cepis. Chalcosthenes made statues of comediansand athletes. Daïppus<span id="ref_206"><a href="#note_206">[206]</a></span> executed a Perixyomenos.<span id="ref_207"><a href="#note_207">[207]</a></span>Daïphron, Democritus,<span id="ref_208"><a href="#note_208">[208]</a></span> and Dæmon made statues of philosophers.</p><p>Epigonus, who has attempted nearly all the above-namedclasses of works, has distinguished himself more particularlyby his Trumpeter, and his Child in Tears, caressing its murderedmother. The Woman in Admiration, of Eubulus, ishighly praised; and so is the Man, by Eubulides,<span id="ref_209"><a href="#note_209">[209]</a></span> reckoningon his Fingers. Micon<span id="ref_210"><a href="#note_210">[210]</a></span> is admired for his athletes; Menogenes,for his four-horse chariots. Niceratus,<span id="ref_211"><a href="#note_211">[211]</a></span> too, whoattempted every kind of work that had been executed by anyother artist, made statues of Aleibiades and of his motherDemarate,<span id="ref_212"><a href="#note_212">[212]</a></span> who is represented sacrificing by the light oftorches.<pb n="6187" /></p><p>Tisicrates<span id="ref_213"><a href="#note_213">[213]</a></span> executed a two-horse chariot in brass, in whichPiston afterwards placed the figure of a female. Piston alsomade the statues of Mars and Mercury, which are in theTemple of Concord at Rome. No one can commend Perillus;<span id="ref_214"><a href="#note_214">[214]</a></span>more cruel even than the tyrant Phalaris<span id="ref_215"><a href="#note_215">[215]</a></span> himself, he madefor him a brazen bull, asserting that when a man was enclosedin it, and fire applied beneath, the cries of the man wouldresemble the roaring of a bull: however, with a cruelty inthis instance marked by justice, the experiment of this torturewas first tried upon himself. To such a degree did this mandegrade the art of representing gods and men, an art moreadapted than any other to refine the feelings! Surely so manypersons had not toiled to perfect it in order to make it an instrumentof torture! Hence it is that the works of Perillus areonly preserved, in order that whoever sees them, may detestthe hands that made them.</p><p>Sthennis<span id="ref_216"><a href="#note_216">[216]</a></span> made the statues of Ceres, Jupiter, and Minerva,which are now in the Temple of Concord; also figures of matronsweeping, adoring, and offering sacrifice; Simon<span id="ref_217"><a href="#note_217">[217]</a></span> executedfigures of a dog and an archer. Stratonicus,<span id="ref_218"><a href="#note_218">[218]</a></span> the chaserin silver, made some figures of philosophers; and so did bothof the artists named Scopas.<span id="ref_219"><a href="#note_219">[219]</a></span></p><p>The following artists have made statues of athletes, armedmen, hunters, and sacrificers—Baton,<span id="ref_220"><a href="#note_220">[220]</a></span> Euchir,<span id="ref_221"><a href="#note_221">[221]</a></span> Glaucides,<span id="ref_222"><a href="#note_222">[222]</a></span>Heliodorus,<span id="ref_223"><a href="#note_223">[223]</a></span> Hicanus, Leophon, Lyson,<span id="ref_224"><a href="#note_224">[224]</a></span> Leon, Menodorus,<span id="ref_225"><a href="#note_225">[225]</a></span><pb n="6188" />Myagrus,<span id="ref_226"><a href="#note_226">[226]</a></span> Polycrates, Polyidus,<span id="ref_227"><a href="#note_227">[227]</a></span> Pythocritus, Protogenes, afamous painter, whom we shall have occasion to mention hereafter;<span id="ref_228"><a href="#note_228">[228]</a></span>Patrocles, Pollis, Posidonius<span id="ref_229"><a href="#note_229">[229]</a></span> the Ephesian, who wasalso a celebrated chaser in silver; Periclymenus,<span id="ref_230"><a href="#note_230">[230]</a></span> Philon,<span id="ref_231"><a href="#note_231">[231]</a></span>Symenus, Timotheus,<span id="ref_232"><a href="#note_232">[232]</a></span> Theomnestus,<span id="ref_233"><a href="#note_233">[233]</a></span> Timarchides,<span id="ref_234"><a href="#note_234">[234]</a></span> Timon,Tisias, and Thrason.<span id="ref_235"><a href="#note_235">[235]</a></span></p><p>But of all these, Callimachus is the most remarkable, onaccount of his surname. Being always dissatisfied with himself,and continually correcting his works, he obtained the nameof "Catatexitechnos;"<span id="ref_236"><a href="#note_236">[236]</a></span> thus affording a memorable exampleof the necessity of observing moderation even in carefulness.His Laconian Female Dancers, for instance, is a most correctperformance, but one in which, by extreme correctness, he haseffaced all gracefulness. It has been said, too, that Callimachuswas a painter also. Cato, in his expedition againstCyprus,<span id="ref_237"><a href="#note_237">[237]</a></span> sold all the statues that he found there, with the exceptionof one of Zeno; in which case he was influenced, neitherby the value of the metal nor by its excellence as a work ofart, but by the fact that it was the statue of a philosopher. Ionly mention this circumstance casually, that an example<span id="ref_238"><a href="#note_238">[238]</a></span>so little followed, may be known.</p><p>While speaking of statues, there is one other that shouldnot be omitted, although its author is unknown, that of Her-<pb n="6189" />cules clothed in a tunic,<span id="ref_239"><a href="#note_239">[239]</a></span> the only one represented in thatcostume in Rome: it stands near the Rostra, and the countenanceis stern and expressive of his last agonies, caused bythat dress. There are three inscriptions on it; the first ofwhich states that it had formed part of the spoil obtained byL. Lucullus<span id="ref_240"><a href="#note_240">[240]</a></span> the general; the second, that his son, while stilla minor, dedicated in accordance with a decree of the Senate;the third, that T. Septimius Sabinus, the curule ædile, had itrestored to the public from the hands of a private individual.So vast has been the rivalry caused by this statue, and so highthe value set upon it.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. vii. c. 39, B. xxxv. c. 34, and B. xxxvi. c. 4.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We have an account of this statue, and of the temple in which it wasplaced, by Pausanias, B. v.
