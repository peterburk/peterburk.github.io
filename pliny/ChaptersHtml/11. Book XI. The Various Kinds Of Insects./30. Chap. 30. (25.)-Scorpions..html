(25.)—SCORPIONS.</head><p>In a similar manner to the spider, the land scorpion also produces maggots<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> similar to eggs, and dies in a similar manner.This animal is a dangerous scourge, and has a venom like thatof the serpent; with the exception that its effects are farmore<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> painful, as the person who is stung will linger forthree days before death ensues. The sting is invariablyfatal to virgins, and nearly always so to matrons. It is soto men also, in the morning, when the animal has issued fromits hole in a fasting state, and has not yet happened to discharge its poison by any accidental stroke. The tail is alwaysready to strike, and ceases not for an instant to menace, sothat no opportunity may possibly be missed. The animalstrikes too with a sidelong blow, or else by turning the tail<pb n="3030" />upwards. Apollodorus informs us, that the poison whichthey secrete is of a white colour, and he has divided them intonine classes, distinguished mostly by their colours—to verylittle purpose, however, for it is impossible to understandwhich among these it is that he has pronounced to be theleast dangerous. He says, also, that some of them have adouble sting, and that the males—for he asserts that they areengendered by the union of the sexes—are the most dangerous.These may easily be known, he says, by their slender formand greater length. He states, also, that they all of them havevenom in the middle of the day, when they have been warmedby the heat of the sun, as, also, when they are thirsty—theirthirst, indeed, can never be quenched. It is an ascertainedfact, that those which have seven joints in the tail are themost<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> deadly; the greater part, however, have but six.</p><p>For this pest of Africa, the southern winds have providedmeans of flight as well, for as the breeze bears them along,they extend their arms and ply them like so many oars intheir flight; the same Apollodorus, however, asserts that thereare some which really have wings.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> The Psylli, who for theirown profit have been in the habit of importing the poisons ofother lands among us, and have thus filled Italy with the pestswhich belong to other regions, have made attempts to importthe flying scorpion as well, but it has been found that itcannot live further north than the latitude of Sicily. However, they<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> are sometimes to be seen in Italy, but are quiteharmless there; they are found, also, in many other places, thevicinity of Pharos, in Egypt, for instance. In Scythia, thescorpion is able to kill the swine even with its sting, an animalwhich, in general, is proof against poisons of this kind in aremarkable degree. When stung, those swine which are blackdie more speedily than others, and more particularly if theyhappen to throw themselves into the water. When a personhas been stung, it is generally supposed that he may be curedby drinking the ashes of the scorpion<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> mixed with wine. It<pb n="3031" />is the belief also that there is nothing more baneful to thescorpion and the stellio,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> than to dip them in oil. This lastanimal is also dangerous to all other creatures, except thosewhich, like itself, are destitute of blood: in figure it stronglyresembles the common lizard. For the most part, also,the scorpion does no injury to any animal which is bloodless.Some writers, too, are of opinion that the scorpion devours itsoffspring, and that the one among the young which is the mostadroit avails itself of its sole mode of escape, by placing itselfon the back of the mother, and thus finding a place where itis in safety from the tail and the sting. The one that thusescapes, they say, becomes the avenger of the rest, and at last,taking advantage of its elevated position, puts its parents todeath. The scorpion produces eleven at a birth.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier remarks, that the scorpion is viviparous; but the young arewhite when born, and wrapped up in an oval mass, for which reason theymay easily be taken for maggots or grubs.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This must be understood of the scorpion of Egypt, Libya, and Syria.The sting of that of the south of Europe is not generally dangerous.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier seems to regard this as fanciful: he says that the instances of<hi rend="ital">se</hi> ven<hi rend="ital" /> joints are but rarely to be met with.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There are no winged scorpions.
