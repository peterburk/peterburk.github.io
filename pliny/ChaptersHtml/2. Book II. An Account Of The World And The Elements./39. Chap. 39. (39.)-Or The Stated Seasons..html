(39.)—OR THE STATED SEASONS.</head><p>It is obvious that there are causes of the seasons and ofother things which have been stated, while there are somethings which are casual, or of which the reason has not yetbeen discovered. For who can doubt that summer andwinter, and the annual revolution of the seasons are causedby the motion of the stars<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>? As therefore the nature of thesun is understood to influence the temperature of the year,so each of the other stars has its specific power, which produces itsappropriate effects. Some abound in a fluid retaining its liquidstate, others, in the same fluid concretedinto hoar frost, compressed into snow, or frozen into hail;some are prolific in winds, some in heat, some in vapours,some in dew, some in cold. But these bodies must not besupposed to be actually of the size which they appear, sincethe consideration of their immense height clearly proves,that none of them are less than the moon. Each of themexercises its influence over us by its own motions; this isparticularly observable with respect to Saturn, which produces a great quantity of rain in its transits. Nor is thispower confined to the stars which change their situations,but is found to exist in many of the fixed stars, whenever<pb n="1067" />they are impelled by the force of any of the planets, or excited by the impulse of their rays; as we find to be the casewith respect to the Suculæ<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>, which the Greeks, in referenceto their rainy nature, have termed the Hyades<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>. There arealso certain events which occur spontaneously, and at statedperiods, as the rising of the Kids<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>. The star Arcturusscarcely ever rises without storms of hail occurring.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Marcus has made some remarks on this subject which may be readwith advantage; Ajasson, ii. 245–6.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The diminutive of Sus.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ab <foreign lang="greek">u(/w,</foreign> pluo.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Hædi were in the constellation Auriga.</p></body>
