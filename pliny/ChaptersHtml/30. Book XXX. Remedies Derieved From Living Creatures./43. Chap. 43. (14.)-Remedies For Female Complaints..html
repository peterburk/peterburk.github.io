<div2 type="chapter" n="43" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 43. (14.)—REMEDIES FOR FEMALE COMPLAINTS.</head><p>For diseases incident to females, a ewe's placenta is veryuseful, as already<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> mentioned by us, when speaking of goats:sheep's dung, too, is equally good. A fumigation of' burntlocusts, applied to the lower parts, affords relief to strangury,in females more particularly. It; immediately after conception, a woman eats a cock's testes every now and then, thechild of which she is pregnant will become<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> a male, it is said.The ashes of a burnt poricupinel taken in drink, are a preventiveof abortion: bitches' milk facilitates delivery: and the after-birth of a bitch, provided it has not touched the ground, willact as an expellent of the fœtus. Milk, taken as a drink,strengthens the loins of women when in travail. Mouse-dung,diluted with rain water, reduces the breasts of females, whenswollen after delivery. The ashes of a burnt hedge-hog,applied with oil, act as a preventive of abortion. Delivery isfacilitated, in cases where the patient has taken, either goose-dung in two cyathi of water, or the liquid that escapes fromthe uterus of a weasel by its genitals.</p><p>Earth-wormrs, applied topically, effectually prevent pains inthe sinews of the neck and shoulders; taken in raisin wine,they expel the after-birth, when retarded. Applied by themselves, earthworms ripen abscesses of the breasts, open them,draw the humours, and make them cicatrize: taken in honiedwine, they promote the secretion of the milk. In hay-grass thereare small worms found, which, attached to the neck, act as apreventive of premature delivery; they are removed, however,at the moment of childbirth, as otherwise they would have theeffect of impeding delivery; care must be taken, also, not to put<pb n="5463" />them on the ground. To promote conception, five or seven ofthem are administered in drink. Snails, taken with the food,accelerate delivery; and, applied with saffron, they promoteconception. Used in the form of a liniment, with amylum<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>and gum tragacanth, they arrest uterine discharges. Takenwith the food, they promote menstruation; and, mixed withdeer's marrow, in the proportion of one denarius and the samequantity of cyprus<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> to each snail, they reduce the uterus whendisplaced. Taken from the shell, and beaten up with oil ofroses, they dispel inflations of the uterus; the snails of Astypalæa being those that are mostly chosen for these purposes.</p><p>Those of Africa, again, are employed in a different manner,two of them being beaten up with a pinch of fenulgreek inthree fingers, and four spoonfuls of honey, and the preparationapplied to the abdomen, after it has been rubbed with juice ofiris.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> There is a kind of small, white, elongated snail,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> thatis found straying here and there: dried upon tiles in the sun,and reduced to powder, these snails are mixed with bean-meal,in equal proportions, forming a cosmetic which whitens andsoftens the skin. The small, broad, kind of snail, mixed withpolenta, is good for the removal of a tendency to scratch andrub the skin.</p><p>If a pregnant woman steps over a viper, she will be sure tomiscarry;<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> the same, too, in the case of the anphisbæna, butonly when it is dead. If, however, a woman carries about her alive amphlisbæna in a box, she may step over one with impunity, even though it be dead. An amphisbæna, preserved forthe purpose, will ensure an easy delivery, even though it bedead.<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> It is a truly marvellous fact, but if a pregnant womansteps over one of these serpents that has not been preserved, itwill be perfectly harmless, provided she immediately stepsover another that has been preserved. A fumigation madewith a dried snake, acts powerfully as an emmenagogue.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. xxvi. c. 77.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Fieri."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xviii. c. 17.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xii. c. 51.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxi. cc. 19, 83.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Varro calls them "albulæ," and says that they were found at Reate.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Of course she will be liable to do so, from fright.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The whole of this account appears to be in a very confused state; andis probably corrupt.
