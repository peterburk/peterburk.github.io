This is particularly the<pb n="3395" />case with the plane, which, from the density of its branches,presents a remarkably broad surface to the wind: when thishappens, the branches are cut off, and the tree, thus lightened,is replaced in its furrow: this, too, has also been done beforenow with the walnut, the olive, and many others.</p><p>(32.) We have many instances cited also of trees falling tothe ground without there being any storm or other perceptiblecause, but merely by way of portentous omen, and then risingagain of themselves. A prodigy of this nature happened tothe citizens of Rome during their wars with the Cimbri: atNuceria, in the grove consecrated to Juno, an elm inclinedto such a degree, even after the top had been cut off, asto overhang the altar there, but it afterwards recovered itselfto such an extent as to blossom immediately: it was from thatvery moment, too, that the majesty of the Roman people beganto flourish once again after it had been laid low by disasterand defeat. A similar circumstance is said to have takenplace also at Philippi, where a willow, which had fallen down,and the top of which had been taken off, rose again; and atStagira, in the Museum<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> there, where the same thing occurredto a white poplar; all which events were looked upon asfavourable omens. But what is most wonderful of all, is thefact that a plane, at Antandros, resumed its original position even after its sides had been rough-hewn all round withthe adze,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and took root again: it was a tree fifteen cubitslong, and four ulnæ in thickness.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">By preventing the action of the air from drying the roots, and so killing the tree.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A grove, probably, consecrated to the Muses.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">These stories must be regarded as either fables or impostures; thoughit is very possible for a tree to survive after the epidermis has been removedwith the adze.</p></body>
