(8.)ÑTHE SITUATION OF CAPPADOCIA.</head><p>We have now gone over the coast which borders upon the<pb n="2017" />Inner<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> Sea, and have enumerated the various nations that dwellthereon; let us now turn to those vast tracts of land which liefurther in the interior. I do not deny that in my descriptionI shall differ very materially from the ancient writers, but stillit is one that has been compiled with the most anxious research,from a full examination into the events which have transpiredof late in these countries under the command of DomitiusCorbulo,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and from information received either from kingswho have been sent thence to Rome, as suppliants for ourmercy, or else the sons of kings who have visited us in thecharacter of hostages.</p><p>We will begin then with the nation of the Cappadocians.</p><p>Of all the countries of Pontus, this<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> extends the greatestdistance into the interior.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> On the left<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> it leaves behind theLesser and the Greater Armenia, as well as Commagene, andon the right all the nations of the province of Asia whichwe have previously described. Spreading over numerouspeoples, it rises rapidly in elevation in an easterly directiontowards the range of Taurus. Then passing Lycaonia, Pisidia,and Cilicia, it advances above the district of Antiochia, theportion of it known as Cataonia extending as far as Cyrrhestica,which forms part of that district. The length of Asia<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> hereis twelve hundred and fifty miles, its breadth six hundredand forty.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or Mediterranean.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See Vol. i. p. 497.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He includes under the term "Cappadocia," the northern part originally called "Cappadocia ad Pontum," and in later times simply Pontus, and the southern part, originally called "Cappadocia ad Taurum," and more recently simply Cappadocia.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Running from the shores of the Euxine to the borders of Syria.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot"><hi rend="ital">I. e.</hi> on the eastern side.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Meaning that part of Asia which we now call Asia Minor.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This ill agrees with what he has said in c. 2, that the distance across from Sinope to the Gulf of Issus is but 200 miles.</p></body>
