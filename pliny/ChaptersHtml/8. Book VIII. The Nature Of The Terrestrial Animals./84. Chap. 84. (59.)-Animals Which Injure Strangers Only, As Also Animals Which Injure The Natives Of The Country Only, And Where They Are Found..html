(59.)—ANIMALS WHICH INJURE STRANGERS ONLY, ASALSO ANIMALS WHICH INJURE THE NATIVES OF THE COUNTRYONLY, AND WHERE THEY ARE FOUND.</head><p>Besides this, there are certain animals, which are harmlessto the natives of the country, but destroy strangers; such are<pb n="2354" />the little serpents at Tirynthus,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> which are said to spring fromout of the earth. In Syria, also, and especially on the banksof the Euphrates, the serpents never attack the Syrians whenthey are asleep, and even if they happen to bite a native whotreads upon them, their venom is not felt; but to persons ofany other country they are extremely hostile, and fiercely attack them, causing a death attended with great torture. Onthis account, the Syrians never kill them. On the contrary,on Latmos, a mountain<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> of Caria, as Aristotle tells us, strangersare not injured by the scorpions, while the natives are killedby them. But I must now give an account of other animalsas well, and of the productions of the earth.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span></p><p>SUMMARY.—Remarkable events, narratives, and observations,seven hundred and eighty-seven.</p><p>ROMAN AUTHORS QUOTED.—Mucianus,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> Procilius,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> VerriusFlaccus,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> L.
