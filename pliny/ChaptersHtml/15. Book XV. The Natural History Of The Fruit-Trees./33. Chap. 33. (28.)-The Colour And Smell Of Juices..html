<div2 type="chapter" n="33" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 33. (28.)—THE COLOUR AND SMELL OF JUICES.</head><p>Among the juices, those of a vinous<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> flavour belong to thepear, the mulberry, and the myrtle, and not to the grape, avery singular fact. An unctuous taste is detected in the olive,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>the laurel, the walnut, and the almond; sweetness exists inthe grape, the fig, and the date; while in the plum class wefind a watery<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> juice. There is a considerable difference, too,in the colours assumed by the various juices. That of themulberry, the cherry, the cornel, and the black grape resembles the colour of blood, while in the white grape the juice iswhite. The humour found in the summit of the fig<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> is of amilky nature, but not so with the juice found in the body ofthe fruit. In the apple it is the colour of foam,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> while in thepeach it is perfectly colourless, and this is the case, too, withthe duracinus,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> which abounds in juice; for who can say thathe has ever detected any colour in it?</p><p>Smell, too, presents its own peculiar marvels; in the appleit is pungent,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> and it is weak in the peach, while in the sweet<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>fruits we perceive none at all: so, too, the sweet wines areinodorous, while the thinner ones have more aroma, and aremuch sooner fit for use than those of a thicker nature.<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> Theodoriferous fruits are not pleasing to the palate in the samedegree, seeing that the flavour<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> of them does not come up totheir smell: hence it is that in the citron we find the smell<pb n="3326" />so extremely penetrating,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> and the taste sour in the highestdegree. Sometimes the smell is of a more delicate<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> nature,as in the quince, for instance; while the fig has no odourwhatever.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">All fruits that are rich in sugar and amidine, Fée says, either have,or acquire in time, a vinous flavour, by the development of a certain quantity of alcohol.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In the fruit with a fixed oil, this principle succeeds, when they areripe, to the mucilaginous.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He must mean a thinner juice, though still sweet.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">About the peduncle or stalk of the fig. The juice here, Fée says, is areal sugar, of the same nature as that which circulates throughout thewhole fruit: the juice in the interior of which is produced by another orderof vessels.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The juice is only foamy when the vinous fermentation is established.It has that appearance, however, when the fruit is bitten with the teeth.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The "hard-berry," or nectarine.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In the sense of aromatic, or penetrating.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He probably means those of a luscious or sirupy nature, without anyacidity whatever.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He seems to mean that the thick, luscious wines require longer keeping, before they will gain any aroma at all. This would be done, probably,at the expense of their sweetness.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or he may mean, that a fine flavour and a fine smell cannot co-exist.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The reading here should be "acutissimus," probably, instead of"acerrimus." The odour exists in the rind of the citron and in the outercoat of the quince; if these are removed, the fruit becomes inodorous.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Tenuis." He may possibly mean "faint."</p></body>
