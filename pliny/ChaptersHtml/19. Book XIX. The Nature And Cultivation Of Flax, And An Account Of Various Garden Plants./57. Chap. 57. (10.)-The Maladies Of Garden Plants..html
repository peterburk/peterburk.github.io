(10.)—THE MALADIES OF GARDEN PLANTS.</head><p>The garden plants, too, like the rest of the vegetable productions, are subject to certain maladies. Thus, for<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> instance,ocimum, when old, degenerates into wild thyme, and sisymbrium<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> into mint, while the seed of an old cabbage producesrape, and vice versâ. Cummin, too, if not kept well hoed, iskilled by hæmodorum,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> a plant with a single stalk, a root si-milar to a bulb in appearance, and never found except in athin, meagre soil. Besides this, cummin is liable to a peculiardisease of its own, the scab:<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> ocimum, too, turns pale at therising of the Dog-star. All plants, indeed, will turn of ayellow complexion on the approach of a woman who has themenstrual discharge<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> upon her.</p><p>There are various kinds of insects,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> too, that breed upon thegarden plants—fleas, for instance, upon turnips, and caterpillars and maggots upon radishes, as well as lettuces and cabbages; besides which, the last two are exposed to the attacksof slugs and snails. The leek, too, is infested with peculiarinsects of its own; which may very easily be taken, however,by laying dung upon the plants, the insects being in the habitof burrowing in it. Sabinus Tiro says, in his book entitled"Cepurica,"<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> which he dedicated to Mæcenas, that it is notadvisable to touch rue, cunila, mint, or ocimum with any implement of iron.<pb n="4200" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">These absurd notions are borrowed from Theophrastus, De Causis, c. 8.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xx. c. 91.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or, according to some readings, "limodorum," a parasitical plant,probably the Lathræa phelypea of Sprengel.
