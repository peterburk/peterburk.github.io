<div2 type="chapter" n="43" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 43. (22.)—STONES FOR MORTARS USED FOR MEDICINAL ANDOTHER PURPOSES. ETESIAN STONE. THEBAIC STONE. CHALAZIAN STONE.</head><p>Authors, too, have paid some attention to the stones in usefor mortars, not only those employed for the trituration ofdrugs and pigments, but for other purposes as well. In thisrespect they have given the preference to Etesian<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> stone beforeall others, and, next to that, to Thebaic stone, already mentioned<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>as being called "pyrrhopœcilon," and known as "psaranus"by some. The third rank has been assigned to chrysites,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>a stone nearly allied to Chalazian<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> stone. For medicinalpurposes, however, basanites<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> has been preferred, this being astone that remits no particles from its surface.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span></p><p>Those stones which yield a liquid, are generally looked uponas good for the trituration of ophthalmic preparations; andhence it is, that the Æthiopian stone is so much in request forthe purpose. Tænarian stone, they say, Phœnician stone, andhæmatites, are good for the preparation of those medicinalcompositions in which saffron forms an ingredient; but theyalso speak of another Tænarian stone, of a dark colour, which,like Parian<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> stone, is not so well adapted for medicinal purposes.We learn from them, too, that Egyptian alabastrites,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>or white ophites,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> from the virtues inherent in them, are consideredstill better adapted for these purposes than the kindslast mentioned. It is this kind of ophites, too, from whichvessels, and casks even, are made.<pb n="6368" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Delafosse suggests that this may have been grey-spotted granite.The name is doubtful, as "Edesian" and Ephesian" are other readings.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In Chapter 13 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Golden stone."
