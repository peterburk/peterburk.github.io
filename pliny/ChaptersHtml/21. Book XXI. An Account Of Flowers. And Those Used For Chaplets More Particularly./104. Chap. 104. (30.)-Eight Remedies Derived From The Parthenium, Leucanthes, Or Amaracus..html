(30.)ÑEIGHT REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE PARTHENIUM, LEUCANTHES, OR AMARACUS.</head><p>The parthenium<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> is by some persons called the "leucanthes," and by others the "amaracus." Celsus, among theLatin writers, gives it the names of "perdicium"<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and "muralis." It grows in the hedge-rows of gardens, and has thesmell of an apple, with a bitter taste. With the decoction ofit, fomentations are made for maladies of the fundament, andfor inflammations and indurations of the uterus: dried andapplied with honey and vinegar, it carries off black bile, forwhich reason it is considered good for vertigo and calculus inthe bladder. It is employed as a liniment, also, for erysipelas, and, mixed with stale axle-grease, for scrofulous sores.For tertian fevers the Magi recommend that it should betaken up with the left hand, it being mentioned at the timefor whom it is gathered, care being also taken not to look back<pb n="4384" />while doing so: a leaf of it should be laid beneath the patient'stongue, after which it must be eaten in a cyathus of water.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Matricaria parthenium of Linn¾us.
