It appears, therefore,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> that someanimals lay up a store of food for the winter, while otherspass the time in sleep, which serves them instead of food.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This statement respecting the "meles," or badger, as well as what issaid of the prescience of the squirrel, is without foundation. There has been some difference of opinion respecting the identity of the animal, whichPliny calls "meles;" by some it has been supposed to be the polecat, orelse the weasel.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This bears reference to what is said of bears in c. 54, and of Alpinemice and hedgehogs.</p></body>
