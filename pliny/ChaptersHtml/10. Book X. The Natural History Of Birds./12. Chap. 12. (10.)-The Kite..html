(10.)ÑTHE KITE.</head><p>The kite, which belongs to the same genus, is distinguishedfrom the rest of the hawks by its larger size. It has been remarked of this bird, extremely ravenous as it is, and alwayscraving, that it has never been known to seize any food eitherfrom among funereal oblations or from the altar of Jupiter atOlympia; nor yet, in fact, does it ever seize any of the consecrated viands from the hands of those who are carrying them;except where some misfortune is presaged for the town that isoffering the sacrifice. These birds seem to have taught manthe art of steering, from the motion of the tail, Nature pointingout by their movements in the air the method required fornavigating the deep. Kites also disappear during the wintermonths, but do not take their departure before the swallow.It is said, also, that after the summer solstice they are troubledwith the gout.</p></div2></body>
