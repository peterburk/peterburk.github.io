(31.)—EIGHT REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE STRYCHNUM OR STRYCHNUM, HALICACABUM, CALLIAS, DORCYNION, MANICON, NEURAS, MORIO, OR MOLY.</head><p>The trychnon<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> is by some called "strychnon;" I only wishthat the garland-makers of Egypt would never use this plantin making their chaplets, being deceived as they are by theresemblance in the leaves of both kinds to those of ivy. Oneof these kinds, bearing scarlet berries with a stone, enclosedin follicules, is by some persons called the "halicacabum,"<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> byothers the "callion," and by the people of our country, the"vesicaria," from the circumstance of its being highly beneficial to the bladder<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and in cases of calculus.</p><p>The trychnon is more of a woody shrub than a herb, withlarge follicules, broad and turbinated, and a large berry within,which ripens in the month of November. A third<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> kind,again, has a leaf resembling that of ocimum—but it is not myintention to give an exact description of it, as I am here speaking of remedies, and not of poisons; for a few drops of thejuice, in fact, are quite sufficient to produce insanity. TheGreek writers, however, have even turned this property intomatter for jesting; for, according to them, taken in doses ofone drachma, this plant is productive of delusive and prurientfancies, and of vain, fantastic visions, which vividly present allthe appearance of reality: they say, too, that it the dose isdoubled, it will produce downright madness, and that any further addition to it, will result in instant death.</p><p>This is the same plant which the more well-meaning writershave called in their innocence "dorycnion,"<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> from the circumstance that weapons used in battle are poisoned with it—for itgrows everywhere—while others, again, who have treated of it<pb n="4385" />more at length,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> have given it the surname of "manicon."<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>Those, on the other hand, who have iniquitously concealed itsreal qualities, give it the name of "erythron" or "neuras,"and others "perisson"—details, however, which need not beentered into more fully, except for the purpose of puttingpersons upon their guard.</p><p>There is another kind, again, also called "halicacabum,"which possesses narcotic qualities, and is productive of deatheven more speedily than opium: by some persons it is called"morio," and by others "moly."<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> It has, however, beenhighly extolled by Diocles and Evenor, and, indeed, Timaristushas gone so far as to sing its praises in verse. With a wonderful obliviousness of remedies really harmless, they tell us, forsooth, that it is an instantaneous remedy for loose teeth torinse them with halicacabum steeped in wine: but at the sametime they add the qualification that it must not be kept in themouth too long, or else delirium will be the result. This, however, is pointing out remedies with a vengeance, the employment of which will be attended with worse results than themalady itself.</p><p>There is a third kind<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> of halicacabum, that is esteemed as anarticle of food; but even though the flavour of it may be preferred to garden plants, and although Xenocrates assures us thatthere is no bodily malady for which the trychnos is not highlybeneficial, they are none of them so valuable as to make methink it proper to speak more at length upon the subject, moreparticularly as there are so many other remedies, which areunattended with danger. Persons who wish to pass themselvesoff for true prophets, and who know too well how to imposeupon the superstitions of others, take the root of the halicacabum in drink. The remedy against this poison—and it is withmuch greater pleasure that I state it—is to drink large quantities of honied wine made hot. I must not omit the fact,too, that this plant is naturally so baneful to the asp, that whenthe root is placed near that reptile, the very animal whichkills others by striking them with torpor, is struck with torpor<pb n="4386" />itself; hence it is, that, beaten up with oil, it is used as a curefor the sting of the asp.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Solanum nigrum of Linnæus, or black night-shade.
