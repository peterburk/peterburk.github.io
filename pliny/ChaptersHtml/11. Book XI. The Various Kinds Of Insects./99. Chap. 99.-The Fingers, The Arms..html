Horatius, a man of patrician rank, had two daughters, whofor this reason had the name of "Sedigit¾;" and we findmention made of Volcatius Sedigitus,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> as a famous poet.The fingers of man have three joints, the thumb only two,it bending in an opposite direction to all the other fingers.Viewed by itself, the movement of the thumb has a sidelongdirection, and it is much thicker than the rest of the fingers.The little finger is equal in length to the thumb, and two othersare also equal in length, the middle finger being the longestof all. Those quadrupeds which live by rapine have five toeson the fore feet, and four on the hinder ones. The lion, thewolf, and the dog, with some few others, have five clawson the hind feet, one of which hangs down near the joint of theleg. The other animals, also, which are of smaller size, havefive toes. The two arms are not always equal in length: itis a well-known fact, that, in the school of gladiators belonging to Caius C¾sar,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> the Thracian Studiosus had the rightarm longer than the left. Some animals also use their forepaws to perform the duties of hands, and employ them inconveying food to the mouth as they sit, the squirrel, for instance.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He wrote a poem, in which the principal Latin dramatists are enume-rated, in the order of merit.
