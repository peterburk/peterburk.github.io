<div2 type="chapter" n="41" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 41. (25.)—THE ECHENEIS, AND ITS USES IN ENCHANTMENTS.</head><p>There is a very small fish<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> that is in the habit of livingamong the rocks, and is known as the echeneis.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> It is believedthat when this has attached itself to the keel of a ship its pro-<pb n="2413" />gress is impeded, and that it is from this circumstance that ittakes its name.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> For this reason, also, it has a disgracefulrepute, as being employed in love philtres,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and for the purpose of retarding judgments and legal proceedings—evil properties, which are only compensated by a single merit that itpossesses—it is good for staying fluxes of the womb in pregnant women, and preserves the fœtus up to birth: it is neverused, however, for food.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> Aristotle<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> is of opinion that this fishhas feet, so strong is the resemblance, by reason of the form andposition of the fins.</p><p>Mucianus speaks of a murex<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> of larger size than the purple,with a head that is neither rough nor round; and the shellof which is single, and falls in folds on either side.<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> He tellsus, also, that some of these creatures once attached themselvesto a ship freighted with children<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> of noble birth, who werebeing sent by Periander for the purpose of being castrated,and that they stopped its course in full sail; and he further<pb n="2414" />says, that the shell-fish which did this service are duly honoured in the temple of Venus,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> at Cnidos. Trebius Nigersays that this fish is a foot in length, and that it can retardthe course of vessels, five fingers in thickness; besides which,it has another peculiar property-when preserved in salt, andapplied, it is able to draw up gold which has fallen into a well,however deep it may happen to be.<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is also from Aristotle, Hist. Anim. 1. ii. c. 17. Oppian alsomentions it, Halieut. B. i. 1. 223, <hi rend="ital">et seq.,</hi> but he gives it all the character-istics of the modern lamprey.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is the Echeueis remora of Linnæus, Cuvier says. It has uponthe head an organ, by means of which it can attach itself to any body.It is thus enabled to fasten to ships and larger fishes; but as for staving aship, it has not, as Cuvier remarks, the slightest power over the very smallest boat. All the eloquence, therefore, which Pliny expends upon it, in B.xxxii. c. 1, is entirely thrown away.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot"><foreign lang="greek">)Apo\ tou= e)\xein nh=as.</foreign> "From holding back ships."</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Used for the purpose of bringing back lost love, or preventing incon-stancy.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B, ii. c. 17.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hardouin says that it is very possible that Aristotle may have writtento this effect in some one of the fifty books of his that have perished, but thatsuch is not the case in his account given of this fish in his Hist. Anim. B.ii. c. 17, for there he expressly says, "There are some people that say thisfish has feet, whereas it has none at all; but they are deceived by the fins,which bear a resemblance to feet." Cuvier says he cannot see in what waythe fins of the remora, or sucking-fish, resemble feet, any more than thosebelonging to any other fish.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier says, that the shell-fish to which Pliny here ascribes a powersimilar to that of the remora, is, if we may judge from his description ofit, of the genus called Cypræa, and has very little doubt that its peculiarform caused its consecration to Venus, fully as much as its supposed miraculous powers. He also remarks that Hardouin, in his Note upon thispassage, supposes an impossibility, in suggesting that the lips of this shellfish can bite the sides of a ship; these lips or edges being hard and immoveable. For some curious particulars as to the peculiar form of somekinds of Cypræa, or cowry, and why they more especially attracted attention, and were held sacred to Venus, see the discussion on them, in theDefence made by Apuleius against the charge of sorcery, which was broughtagainst him.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Rondelet, B. xiii. c. 12, says that this kind of shell was formerly usedfor the purpose of smoothing paper.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Herodotus tells us, B. iii. c. 48, that these were 300 boys of noblefamilies of the Corcyræans, and that they were being sent from Perianderof Corinth, to Alyattes, king of Sardes.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Venus was fabled to have emerged from the sea in a shell.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Rabelais refers to these wonderful stories about the echeneis or remora,B. iv. c. 62: "And indeed, why should he have thought this difficult, seeingthat——an echeneis or remora, a silly, weakly fish, in spite of all thewinds that blow from the thirty-two points of the compass, will in themidst of a hurricane make you, the biggest first-rate, remain stock still, asif she were becalmed, or the blustering tribe had blown their last; nay,and with the flesh of that fish, preserved with salt, you may fish gold outof the deepest well that ever was sounded with a plummet; for it willcertainly draw up the precious metal."</p></body>
