<div2 type="chapter" n="25" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 25.—DACIA, SARMATIA.</head><p>On setting out from this spot, all the nations metwith are Scythian in general, though various races haveoccupied the adjacent shores; at one spot the Getæ<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>, by theRomans called Daci; at another the Sarmatæ, by the Greekscalled Sauromatæ, and the Hamaxobii<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> or Aorsi, a branchof them; then again the base-born Scythians and descendants of slaves, or else the Troglodytæ<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>; and then, afterthem, the Alani<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and the Rhoxalani. The higher<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> partsagain, between the Danube and the Hercynian Forest<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>, asfar as the winter quarters of Pannonia at Carnuntum<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>, andthe borders of the Germans, are occupied by the Sarmatianlazyges<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>, who inhabit the level country and the plains,<pb n="1330" />while the Daci, whom they have driven as far as the riverPathissus<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>, inhabit the mountain and forest ranges. Onleaving the river Marus<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>, whether it is that or the Duria<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>,that separates them from the Suevi and the kingdom ofVannius<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>, the Basternæ, and, after them, other tribes ofthe Germans occupy the opposite sides<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>. Agrippa considersthe whole of this region, from the Ister to the ocean, to be2100 miles in length, and 4400 miles in breadth to the riverVistula in the deserts<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> of Sarmatia. The name "Scythian"has extended, in every direction, even to the Sarmatæ and theGermans; but this ancient appellation is now only given tothose who dwell beyond those nations, and live unknown tonearly all the rest of the world.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Though Strabo distinguishes the Getæ from the Daci, most of theancient writers, with Pliny, speak of them as identical. It is not known,however, why the Getæ in later times assumed the name of Daci.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Dwellers in waggons." These were a Sarmatian tribe who wandered with their waggons along the banks of the Volga. The chief seatsof the Aorsi, who seem in reality to have been a distinct people from theHamaxobii, was in the country between the Tanais, the Euxine, theCaspian, and the Caucasus.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Dwellers in Caves." This name appears to have been given tovarious savage races in different parts of the world.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There were races of the Alani in Asia on the Caucasus, and in Europe on the Mæotis and the Euxine; but their precise geographicalposition is not clearly ascertained.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The present Transylvania and Hungary.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The name given in the age of Pliny to the range of mountains extending around Bohemia, and through Moravia into Hungary.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Its ruins are still to be seen on the south bank of the Danube nearHaimburg, between Deutsch-Altenburg and Petronell. The Roman fleetof the Danube, with the 14th legion, was originally established there.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In Pliny's time this migratory tribe seems to have removed to theplains between the Lower Theiss and the mountains of Transylvania,from which places they had expelled the Dacians.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Lower Theiss.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now the river Mark, Maros, or Morava.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The name of the two streams now known as the Dora Baltea andDora Riparia, both of which fall into the Po. This passage appears tobe in a mutilated state.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A chief of the Quadi; who, as we learn from Tacitus, was made kingof the Suevi by Germanicus, A.D. <date value="19" authname="19">19</date>. Being afterwards expelled by hisnephews Vangio and Sido, he received from the emperor Claudius asettlement in Pannonia. Tacitus gives the name of Suevia to the wholeof the east of Germany from the Danube to the Baltic.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">According to Hardouin, Pliny here speaks of the other side of themountainous district called Higher Hungary, facing the Danube andextending from the river Theiss to the Morava.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This, according to Sillig, is the real meaning of <hi rend="ital">adesertis</hi> here, thedistance being measured from the Danube, and not between the Vistulaand the wilds of Sarmatia. The reading "four thousand" is probablycorrupt, but it seems more likely than that of 404 miles, adopted byLittre, in his French translation.</p></body>
