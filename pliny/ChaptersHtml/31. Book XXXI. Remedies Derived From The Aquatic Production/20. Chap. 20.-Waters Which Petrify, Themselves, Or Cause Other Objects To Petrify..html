<div2 type="chapter" n="20" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 20.—WATERS WHICH PETRIFY, THEMSELVES, OR CAUSE OTHEROBJECTS TO PETRIFY.</head><p>At Perperena,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> there is a spring which petrifies<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> the groundwherever it flows, the same being the case also, with the hotwaters at Ædepsus, in Eubœa; for there, wherever the streamfalls, the rocks are continually increasing in height. At Eury-mente,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> chaplets, when thrown into the waters of a certain fountain there, are turned to stone. At Colossæ there is a river, intothe water of which if bricks<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> are thrown, when taken out theyare found changed into stone. In the mines of Scyros, the treespetrify that are watered by the river, branches and all. Inthe caverns of Mount Corycus, the drops of water that trickledown the rocks become hard in the form of a stone.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> AtMieza, too, in Macedonia, the water petrifies as it hangs fromthe vaulted roofs of the rocks; but at Corycus it is only whenit has fallen that it becomes hard.</p><p>In other caverns, again, the water petrifies both ways,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> andso forms columns; as we find the case in a vast grotto at Phlan-sia, a town of the Chersonesus<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> of the Rhodians, the columnsof which are tinted with various colours. These instances willsuffice for the present.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A town of Mysia, south of Adramyttium.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">As Ajasson remarks, numerous instances are known of this at thepresent day.
