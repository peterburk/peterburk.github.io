<div2 type="chapter" n="3" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 3. (3.)—THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF EAGLES.</head><p>Of all the birds with which we are acquainted, the eagle islooked upon as the most noble, and the most remarkable forits strength. There are six<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> different kinds; the one called"melanætos"<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> by the Greeks, and "valeria" in our language,<pb n="2482" />the least in size of them all, but the most remarkable for itsstrength, is of a blackish colour. It is the only one amongall, the eagles that feeds its young; for the others, as we shallmention just now, drive them away; it is the only one toothat has neither cry nor murmur; it is an inhabitant of themountains. The second kind is the pygargus,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> an inhabitantof the cities and plains, and distinguished by the whitenessof its tail. The third is the morphnos,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> which Homer alsocalls the "perenos," while others, again, call it the "plangus"and the "anataria;" it is the second in size and strength, anddwells in the vicinity of lakes. Phemonoë, who was styledthe "daughter of Apollo," has stated that this eagle has teeth,but that it has neither voice nor tongue; she says also that itis the blackest of all the eagles, and has a longer tail than therest; Bœus is of the same opinion. This eagle has the instinctto break the shell of the tortoise by letting it fall from aloft,a circumstance which caused the death of the poet Æschylus.An oracle, it is said, had predicted his death on that day bythe fall of a house, upon which he took the precaution oftrusting himself only under the canopy of the heavens.</p><p>The fourth kind of eagle is the "percnopterus,"<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> also calledthe "oripelargus;"<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> it has much the appearance of the vulture,<pb n="2483" />with remarkably small wings, while the rest of the body islarger than the others; but it is of a timid and degeneratenature, so much so, that even a raven can beat it. It is alwaysfamishing and ravenous, and has a plaintive murmuring cry.It is the only one among the eagles that will carry off thedead carcase; the others settle on the spot where they havekilled their prey. The character of this species causes thefifth one to be known by the distinctive name of "gnesios,"<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>as being the genuine eagle, and the only one of untaintedlineage; it is of moderate size, of rather reddish colour, andrarely to be met with. The haliætus<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> is the last, and is remarkable for its bright and piercing eye. It poises itself aloft,and the moment it catches sight of a fish in the sea below,pounces headlong upon it, and cleaving the water with itsbreast, carries off its prey.</p><p>The eagle which we have mentioned as forming the thirdspecies, pursues the aquatic birds in the vicinity of standingwaters: in order to make their escape they plunge into thewater every now and then, until at length they are overtakenby lassitude and sleep, upon which the eagle immediately seizesthem. The contest that takes place is really a sight worthyto be seen. The bird makes for the shore to seek a refuge,and especially if there should happen to be a bed of reedsthere; while in the meantime the eagle endeavours to drive itaway with repeated blows of its wings, and tumbles into thewater in its attempts to seize it. While it is standing on theshore its shadow is seen by the bird, which immediately divesbeneath, and then making its way in an opposite direction,emerges at some point at which it thinks it is the least likelyto be looked for. This is the reason why these birds swimin flocks, for when in large numbers they are in no dangerfrom the enemy; as by dashing up the spray with their wingsthey blind him.</p><p>Again, it often happens that the eagle is not able to carrythe bird aloft on account of its weight, and in consequencethey both of them sink together. The haliætus, and thisone only, beats its young ones while in an unfledged state,<pb n="2484" />with its wings, and forces<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> them from time to time to looksteadily upon the rays of the sun; and if it sees either ofthem wink, or even its eye water, it throws it headlong outof the nest, as being spurious and degenerate, while, on theother hand, it rears the one whose gaze remains fixed andsteady. The haliætus<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> is not a species of itself, but is aneagle of mixed breed: hence their produce are of the speciesknown as the ossifrage, from which again is produced thesmaller vulture; while this in its turn produces the largevulture, which, however, is quite barren.</p><p>Some writers add to the above a seventh kind, which theycall the "bearded"<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> eagle; the Tuscans, however, call it theossifrage.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier remarks, that this passage is borrowed, with some changes,from Aristotle's "History of Animals," B. ix. c. 32, but that the account givenby Pliny is not very easily explained, from the fact that the word <hi rend="ital">eagle is</hi>not used by him in a rigorous acceptation of the word. Indeed it is onlyat the present day that any accurate knowledge has been obtained as tothe different species of eagles, and the changes of colour to which theyare subject with the advance of age; circumstances which have caused thespecies of them to be multiplied by naturalists. It is very doubtful,he says, whether Aristotle has distinguished the various kinds any betterthan Pliny; although Buffon, who himself was not very successful indistinguishing them, says that Aristotle understood more on the subjectthan the moderns.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot"><foreign lang="greek">Melanaeto\s,</foreign> or the "black eagle." Cuvier says, that this descriptionis copied exactly from Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. ix. c. 32. This eagle, hesays, cannot be, as is commonly supposed, the "common eagle." It canonly be, he thinks, the "small" eagle, the female of which, according toNauman and Savigny, when it is old is almost all black, and without spots;only the young being spotted.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From the Greek <foreign lang="greek">pugh\ a)rgh\,</foreign> "white tail." Cuvier remarks, thatthis is copied exactly from Aristotle, except that he says nothing about thewhiteness of the tail, which is an interpolation. The feathers as describedagree with those of the common eagle, the Falco fulvus, which is strongenough to seize a fawn. As regards its habit, he says, of dwelling onplains, that would agree better with the Jean le blanc of the French, theFalco Gallicus; while the name of pygargus is commonly applied, at thepresent day, to the great sea-eagle, the Falco albicilla; which frequentslakes and the sea-shore, and therefore corresponds more nearly with thehaliætus of Pliny.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier says, that he is almost tempted to believe that it is the balbusard, the Falco haliætus, that is here meant, as it has a black back, andlives in the vicinity of lakes. But then, he remarks, it lives on fish andnot aquatic birds; while, on the other hand, the little eagle of Buffon, theFalco nævio, often seizes ducks and other aquatic animals. He is inclinedthen, notwithstanding the apparent confusion, to take this morphnos forthe modern small eagle. The words <foreign lang="greek">morfno\s</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">perkno\s</foreign> signify "black."</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From the Greek, meaning "black wing.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Mountain stork."
