<div2 type="chapter" n="45" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 45.—THE VARIOUS KINDS OF HORNS. ANIMALS IN WHICHTHEY ARE MOVEABLE.</head><p>Horns, too, of various forms have been granted to manyanimals of the aquatic, marine, and reptile kind, but thosewhich are more properly understood under that name belongto the quadrupeds only; for I look upon the tales of Actæonand of Cippus even, in Latin story, as nothing more nor less thanfables.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> And, indeed, in no department of her works hasNature displayed a greater capriciousness. In providing animals with these weapons, she has made merry at their expense; for some she has spread them out in branches, thestag, for instance; to others she has given them in a moresimple form, as in the " subulo," so called from the resemblance of its horns to a " subula,"<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> or shoemaker's awl. Inothers, again, she has flattened them in the shape of a man'shand, with the fingers extended, from which circumstance theanimal has received the name of " platyceros.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> To the roebuck she has given branching horns, but small, and has madethem so as not to fall off and be cast each year; while to theram she has given them of a contorted and spiral form, asthough she were providing it with a cæstus for offence. Thehorns of the bull, again, are upright and threatening. In thislast kind, the females, too, are provided with them, while inmost it is only the males. The chamois has them, curvingbackwards; while in the fallow deer<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> they bend forward.The strepsiceros,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> which in Africa bears the name of addax, hashorns erect and spiral, grooved and tapering to a sharp point,so much so, that you would almost take them to be the sidesof a lyre.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> In the oxen of Phrygia, the horns are moveable,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span><pb n="3045" />like the ears; and among the cattle of the Troglodytæ, theyare pointed downwards to the ground, for which reason it isthat they are obliged to feed with the head on one side.Other animals, again, have a single horn, and that situate inthe middle of the head, or else on the nose, as alreadystated.<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span></p><p>Then, again, in some animals the horns are adapted forbutting, and in others for goring; with some they are curvedinwards, with others outwards, and with others, again, theyare fitted for tossing: all which objects are effected in various ways, the horns either lying backwards, turning from, orelse towards each other, and in all cases running to a sharppoint. In one kind, also, the horns are used for the purposeof scratching the body, instead of hands.</p><p>In snails the horns are fleshy, and are thus adapted for thepurpose of feeling the way, which is also the case with the ce-rastes;<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> some reptiles, again, have only one horn, though thesnail has always two, suited for protruding and withdrawing.The barbarous nations of the north drink from the horns of theurus,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> a pair of which will hold a couple of urnæ:<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> othertribes, again, point their spears with them. With us they arecut into laminæ, upon which they become transparent; indeed,the rays of a light placed within them may be seen to a muchgreater distance than without. They are used also for variousappliances of luxury, either coloured or varnished, or elsefor those kinds of paintings which are known as " cestrota,"<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>or horn-pictures. The horns of all animals are hollow within,it being only at the tip that they are solid: the only exception is the stag, the horn of which is solid throughout, andis cast every year. When the hoofs of oxen are worn to thequick, the husbandmen have a method of curing them, byanointing the horns of the animal with grease. The substanceof the horns is so ductile, that even while upon the body ofthe living animal, they can be bent by being steeped in boiling wax, and if they are split down when they are first shooting, they may be twisted different ways, and so appear to be<pb n="3046" />four in number upon one head. In females the horns are generally thinner than in the males, as is the case, also, with mostkinds of wool-bearing animals.</p><p>No individuals, however, among sheep, or hinds, nor yetany that have the feet divided into toes, or that have solidhoofs, are furnished with horns; with the sole exception ofthe Indian ass,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> which is armed with a single horn. To thebeasts that are cloven-footed Nature has granted two horns,but to those that have fore-teeth in the upper jaw, she hasgiven none. Those persons who entertain the notion that thesubstance of these teeth is expended in the formation of thehorns, are easily to be refuted, if we only consider the case ofthe hind, which has no more teeth than the male, and yetis without horns altogether. In the stag the horn is onlyimbedded in the skin, but in the other<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> animals it adheres tothe bone.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The suddenness of their appearance, no doubt, was fabulous; but wehave well-authenticated cases in recent times of substances growing on thehuman head, to all appearance resembling horns, and arising from a disordered secretion of the hair. Witness the case of Mary Davies, a so-called horn from whose head is preserved in the Ashmolean Museum atOxford. The story of Cippus, the Roman prætor, is told byOvid, Met.
