<div2 type="chapter" n="8" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 8. (7.)ÑTHE ERYNGE OR ERYNGIUM.</head><p>In the first rank of the plants armed with prickles, theerynge,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> or eryngion stands pre-eminent, a vegetable productionheld in high esteem as an antidote formed for the poison of ser-pents and all venomous substances. For stings and bites ofthis nature, the root is taken in wine in doses of one drachma,or if, as generally is the case, the wound is attended withfever, in water. It is employed also, in the form of a lini-<pb n="4397" />ment, for wounds, and is found to be particularly efficaciousfor those inflicted by water-snakes or frogs. The physicianHeraclides states it as his opinion that, boiled in goose-broth,it is a more valuable remedy than any other known, for aconite<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and other poisons.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> Apollodorus recommends that, incases of poisoning, it should be boiled with a frog, and otherauthorities, in water only. It is a hardy plant, having muchthe appearance of a shrub, with prickly leaves and a jointedstem; it grows a cubit or more in height. Sometimes it isfound of a whitish colour, and sometimes black,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> the root of itbeing odoriferous. It is cultivated in gardens, but it is frequently to be found growing<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> spontaneously in rugged andcraggy localities. It grows, too, on the sea-shore, in which caseit is tougher and darker than usual, the leaf resembling that ofparsley.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It has been thought by some that this is the Scolymus maculatus ofLinn¾us; the spotted yellow thistle. But the more general opinion isthat it is the eringo, or Eryngium campestre of Linn¾us. It derives itsname from the Greek <foreign lang="greek">e)reu/gein,</foreign> from its asserted property of dispellingflatulent erucatatins. It is possessed in reality of few medicinal proper-ties, and is only used occasionally, at the present day, as a diuretic. SeeB. xxi. c. 56.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxvii. c. 2.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">By the word "toxica," Poinsinet would understand, not poisons ingeneral, but the venom of the toad, which was called, he says, in theCeltic and Celto-Scythic languages, <hi rend="ital">toussac</hi> and <hi rend="ital">tossa.</hi> FŽe ridicules thenotion.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or rather, FŽe says, deep blue. He identifies this with the Eryngiumcyaneum of Linn¾us, the eringo, with a blue flower.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This, as well as the next, is identical, probably, with the Eryngiummaritimum of Linn¾us; our sea-holly. The species found in Greece, inaddition to the above; are the Eryngium tricuspidatum, multifidum, andparviflorum.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny probably makes a mistake here, and reads <foreign lang="greek">seli/non,</foreign> "parsley,"for <foreign lang="greek">sko/lumos,</foreign> a "thistle." Dalechamps is of this opinion, from an examination of the leaf; and Brotier adopts it.</p></body>
