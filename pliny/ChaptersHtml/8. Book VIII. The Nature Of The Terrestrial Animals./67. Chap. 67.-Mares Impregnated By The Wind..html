Gallicia and Asturia are also countries of Spain;they produce a species of horse known to us as thieldones,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>and when smaller, asturcones;<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> they have a peculiar and notcommon pace of their own, which is very easy, and arises fromthe two legs of the same side being moved together;<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> it is bystudying the nature of this step that our horses have been taughtthe movement which we call ambling.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> Horses have verynearly the same diseases as men;<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> besides which, they aresubject to an irregular action of the bladder, as, indeed, is thecase with all beasts of burden.<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Lisbon. See B. iv. c. 35.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The accounts given, by Phœnician navigators, of the fertility of Lusitania, and the frequency of the mild western breezes, gave rise to the fablehere mentioned, which has been generally received by the ancients; andthat not merely by the poets, as Virgil, Geor. B. iii. 1. 274, 275, but bypractical writers, as Varro, B. ii. c. 1, and Columella, B. vi. c. 27. Justin,however, B. xliv. c. 3, attributes the opinion to the great size of the horses,and their remarkable fleetness, from which they were said to be the sons ofthe wind.—B.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The origin and meaning of this name is not known.—B.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Martial describes the peculiar short, quick step of the "asturco," inone of his Epigrams, B. xiv.
