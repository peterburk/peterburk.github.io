How much more happy theage when things themselves were bartered for one another; aswas the case in the times of the Trojan war, if we are to believewhat Homer says. For, in this way, in my opinion, wascommerce then carried on for the supply of the necessaries oflife. Some, he tells us, would make their purchases by barteringox-hides, and others by bartering iron or the spoil which theyhad taken from the enemy:<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and yet he himself, already anadmirer of gold, was so far aware of the relative value of things,that Glaucus, he informs us, exchanged his arms of gold, valuedat one hundred oxen, for those of Diomedes, which were worthbut nine.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> Proceeding upon the same system of barter, manyof the fines imposed by ancient laws, at Rome even, werelevied in cattle,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> [and not in money].</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Sacrum famæ." This is the reading given by the Bamberg MS.in substitution for "aurum, sacra fames" and other readings of a similarnature, in which Pliny was thought by the commentators to allude to thefamous lines of Virgil—<lb />"Quid non mortalia pectora cogis,<lb />Auri sacra fames!"<lb />Had he alluded to the passage of Virgil, it is not probable that he wouldhave used the expression in the plural, "celeberrimi auctores."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Il.
