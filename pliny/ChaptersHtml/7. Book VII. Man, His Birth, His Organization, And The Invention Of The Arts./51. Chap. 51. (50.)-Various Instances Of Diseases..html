Cornelius Rufus,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> who was consul with M. Curio, lost hissight while he was asleep and dreaming that that accident hadbefallen him. On the other hand, Jason, of Pheræ, when hewas labouring under an abscess and had been given up by thephysicians, determined to end his life in battle, where he received a wound in the chest, and found, at the hands of theenemy, a remedy for his disease.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> Q. Fabius Maximus,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> the<pb n="2207" />consul, having engaged in battle with the Allobroges and theArverni, at the river Isara, on the sixth day before the ides ofAugust, and having slain there one hundred and thirty thousand of the enemy, found himself cured, during the engage.ment, of a quartan fever.</p><p>This gift of life, which is bestowed upon us by nature, isextremely uncertain and frail, whatever portion of it may beallotted to us. The measure is, indeed, but scanty and brief,even when it is the largest, if we only reflect upon the extentof eternity. And then, besides, if we take into account oursleep during the night, we can only be properly said to livehalf the period of our life; seeing that just one half of it ispassed, either in a state resembling death, or else of bodily suffering, if we are unable to sleep. Added to this, we ought notto reckon the years of infancy, during which we are not sensible of our existence, nor yet the years of old age, which isprolonged only for the punishment of those who arrive at it.There are so many kinds of dangers, so many diseases, so manyapprehensions, so many cares, we so often invoke death, thatreally there is nothing that is so often the object of our wishes.Nature has, in reality, bestowed no greater blessing on manthan the shortness of life. The senses become dull, the limbstorpid, the sight, the hearing, the legs, the teeth, and theorgans of digestion, all of them die before us, and yet wereckon this state as a part of our life. The solitary instance ofXenophilus, the musician,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> who lived one hundred and fiveyears without any infirmity of body, must be regarded then asa kind of miracle; for, by Hercules! all other men are subject, at certain fixed periods, to recurring and deadly attacks byheat or cold, in every part of the body, a thing that is notthe case with other animals; and these attacks, too, return notonly at regular hours, but on certain days and certain nights—sometimes the third day, sometimes the fourth, sometimesevery day throughout the year.<pb n="2208" /></p><p>And then, too, there is another kind of fatal disease, thatwhich is produced by over-exertion of the mental faculties.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>Nature has appointed certain laws as well for our maladies;quartan fevers never commence at the winter solstice, nor yetduring the winter months; some diseases never attack us afterthe sixtieth year; some again disappear at the age of puberty,especially in females;<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> while aged persons are but seldomaffected by the plague. There are some diseases which attackwhole nations; others prevail among classes; some amongslaves,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> others among the higher ranks, and others among otherclasses of society. It has been remarked, in reference to thissubject, that the plague always takes a course from the south towards the west,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> and scarcely ever in an opposite direction; itnever appears in the winter, or lasts longer than three months.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Consul A.U.C. 463; he is generally called Rufinus.—B.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This anecdote is mentioned by Cicero, De Nat.

Poinsinet endeavours to reconcile the discrepancy, by the circumstance, that music formed a prominentpart of the Pythagorean discipline.—B.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Per sapientiam mori." Many conjectures have been formed respecting the meaning of this passage, which is obscure. Attempts have beenmade to amend the reading of the text, but; as it appears, without success;see the notes of Hardouin, Ajasson, and others, Lemaire, vol. iii. pp. 197,8.—B. It is pretty clear, however, that Pliny here refers to what, in thenext Chapter, he calls "sapientiæ ægritudo," the malady by the Greekscalled "phrenesis," and by us "frenzy," which attacks the seat of wisdom,the understanding. Many pages have been written upon the meaning ofthis passage, obvious as it seems to be.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The same doctrine is advanced in B. xxviii., which treats of medicine,sec, c. 10.—B.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Among the ancients, all the manufactures and mechanical arts werecarried on by slaves; they were, consequently, subjected to the same kindsof morbid causes which are found, in modern times, to be so detrimentalto certain descriptions of workmen.—B.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Our own experience has taught us the truth of this observation in thecase of the cholera; and the great plague of <date value="1348" authname="1348">1348</date>, which is thought tohave swept off one-third of mankind, is supposed to have travelled toEurope from the vicinity of the Ganges.</p></body>
