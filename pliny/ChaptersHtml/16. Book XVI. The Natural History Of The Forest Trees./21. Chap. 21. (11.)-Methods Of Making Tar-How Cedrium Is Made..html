<div2 type="chapter" n="21" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 21. (11.)—METHODS OF MAKING TAR—HOW CEDRIUM IS MADE.</head><p>In Europe, tar is extracted from the torch-tree<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> by theagency of fire; it is employed for coating ships and for manyother useful purposes.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> The wood of the tree is chopped<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>into small billets, and then put into a furnace, which is heatedby fires lighted on every side. The first steam that exudesflows in the form of water into a reservoir made for its reception: in Syria this substance is known as "cedrium;"<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> andit possesses such remarkable strength, that in Egypt the bodiesof the dead, after being steeped in it, are preserved from allcorruption.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Numerous varieties of the coniferæ supply us with tar, and Pliny isin error in deriving it solely from the torch-tree, the Pinus mugho of Linnæus.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxiv. c. 23.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is still obtained in a similar way.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Fée remarks, that Pliny is in error here; this red, watery fluid formedin the extraction of tars, being quite a different thing from "cedrium," the<hi rend="ital">alkitran</hi> or <hi rend="ital">kitran</hi> of the Arabs; which is not improbably made from acedar, or perhaps the Juniperus Phœnicea, called "Cedrus" by the twoBauhins and Tournefort. He says that it is not likely that the Egyptianswould use this red substance for the purpose of preserving the dead, chargedas it is with empyreumatic oil, and destitute of all properties peculiar toresins.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxi. c. 3, and B. xxiv. c. 23.</p></body>
