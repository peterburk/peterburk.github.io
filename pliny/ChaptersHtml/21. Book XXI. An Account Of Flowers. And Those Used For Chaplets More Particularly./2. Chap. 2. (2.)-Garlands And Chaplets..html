Indeed, it was only by very slow degrees thatthis last word<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> became generalized, as the chaplets that wereused at sacrifices, or were granted as the reward of militaryvalour, asserted their exclusive right to the name of "corona."As for garlands, when they came to be made of flowers, theyreceived the name of "serta," from the verb "sero,"<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> orelse from our word "series."<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> The use<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> of flowers for garlands is not so very ancient, among the Greeks even.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">According to Boettiger, the word "struppus" means a string arrangedas a fillet or diadem.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Fée makes the word "vocabulum" apply to "corona," and not to"struppus;" but the passage will hardly admit of that rendering.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"To bind" or "join together."</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A "connected line," from the verb "sero."</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">By "quod," Hardouin takes Pliny to mean, the use of the word<foreign lang="greek">sparto\n,</foreign> among the Greeks, corresponding with the Latin word "sertum."</p></body>
