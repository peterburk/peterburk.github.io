(4.)â€”THE NATURE OF OLIVE OIL.</head><p>It is one of the properties of oil to impart warmth to thebody, and to protect it against the action of cold; while atthe same time it promotes coolness in the head when heated.The Greeks, those parents of all vices, have abused it by mak-ing it minister to luxury, and employing it commonly in thegymnasium: indeed, it is a well-known fact that the gover-nors of those establishments have sold the scrapings<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> of theoil used there for a sum of eighty thousand sesterces. Themajesty of the Roman sway has conferred high honour uponthe olive: crowned with it, the troops of the Equestrian orderare wont to defile upon the ides of July;<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> it is used, too, bythe victor in the minor triumphs of the ovation.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> At Athens,<pb n="3285" />also, they are in the habit of crowning the conqueror witholive; and at Olympia, the Greeks employ the wild olive<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> fora similar purpose.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It will be stated in B. xxviii. c. 13, to what purposes this abominablecollection of filth was applied.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">15th of July. He alludes to the inspection of the Equites, whichoriginally belonged to the Censors, but afterwards to the Emperors.

In later times, however, the victor en-tered on horseback: and a wreath of myrtle, sometimes laurel, was wornby him.
