<div2 type="chapter" n="46" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 46.—MYROBALANUM.</head><p>In the country of the Troglodytæ, the Thebais, and the partsof Arabia which separate Judæa from Egypt, myrobalanum<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> iscommonly found; it is provided by Nature for unguents, asfrom its very name would appear. From its name, also, it isevident that it is the nut of a tree, with a leaf similar to thatof the heliotropium, which we shall have to mention whenspeaking of the herbs. The fruit of this tree is about the sizeof a filbert. The kind that grows in Arabia is known asSyriaca, and is white, while, on the other hand, that whichgrows in the Thebais is black: the former is preferred for thequality of the oil extracted from it, though that which is pro-<pb n="3143" />duced in the Thebais yields it in larger quantities. Amongthese various kinds, that which is sent from the country of theTroglodytæ is the worst of all. There are some persons whoprefer that of Æthiopia<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> to all of these, the nut of which isblack, and not oleaginous; it has only a very small kernel, butthe liquid which is extracted from it is more odoriferous thanthat of the other kinds; it grows, too, in a champaign, opencountry. It is said that the Egyptian nut is even more oleaginous, being of a reddish colour with a thicker shell, andthat the plant, although it grows in wet, marshy spots, isshorter and drier than the other kinds. The Arabian nut,again, is said to be of a green colour and of smaller size, butharder and more compact, from the circumstance that it growsin mountainous districts. The best of all, however, is that ofPetra, which comes from a city mentioned<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> on a previousoccasion; it has a black shell, but the kernel is white. Theperfumers, however, only extract the juices from the shells;but medical men pound the kernels, pouring warm water onthem, little by little, as they do it.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Signifying the "unguent acorn," or "nut." There is little doubtthat the behen or ben nut of the Arabians is meant, of which there areseveral sorts. It is used by the Hindoos for calico printing and pharmacyand was formerly employed in Europe in the arts, and for medical purposes. It is no longer used as a perfume. The "oil of ben" used incommerce is extracted from the fruit of the Moringa oleifera of naturalists.It is inodorous; for which reason, Fée is of opinion that the name signifies"the oily nut," and quotes Dioscorides, who says, B. iv., that an oil is extracted from this balanus, which is used as an ingredient in unguents, inplace of other oils. Fée also says that at the present day it is used by perfumers, to fix or arrest the evanescent odours of such flowers as the jasmineand the lily.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This Æthiopian variety is quite unknown, and is, as Fée remarks,most probably of a different species from the genuine myrobalanus.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. vi. c. 32.</p></body>
