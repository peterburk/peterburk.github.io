(50.)ÑTE TAILS OF ANIMALS.</head><p>Nearly all the animals, both viviparous as well as oviparous,<pb n="3093" />with the exception of man and the ape, have tails in proportion to the necessities of the body. In animals with bristlesthe tail is bare, as in the boar, for instance. In those that areshaggy, it is small, such as the bear; while in those animalsthat have long hair, the tail is long also, the horse, for instance. The tail of a lizard or serpent, if cut off, will growagain. The tail governs the movements of the fish like arudder, and turning from side to side, to the right or to theleft, impels it onwards, acting in some degree like an oar.A double tail is sometimes found in lizards. In oxen, thestalk of the tail is of remarkable length, and is covered withrough hair at the extremity. In the ass, too, it is longer thanin the horse, but in beasts of burden it is covered with bristlyhairs. The tail of the lion, at the extremity, is like that ofthe ox and the field-mouse; but this is not the case with thepanther. In the fox and the wolf it is covered with longhair, as in sheep, in which it is longer also. In swine, thetail is curled; among dogs, those that are mongrels carry itclose beneath the belly.</p></div2></body>
