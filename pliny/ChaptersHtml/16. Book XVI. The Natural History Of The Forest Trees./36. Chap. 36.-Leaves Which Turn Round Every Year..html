These trees also present in their leaves the same difference that is to be observed in those of all the rest: theunderside, which looks towards the ground, is of a green,<pb n="3377" />grassy colour, and has a smooth surface;<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> while the veins, thecallous skin, and the articulations, lie upon the upper face, theveins making incisions in the parts beneath, like those to beseen upon the human hand. The leaf of the olive is whiterabove, and not so smooth; the same is the case, too, with thatof the ivy. The leaves of all trees turn<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> every day towards the sun, the object being that the under side may bewarmed by its heat. The upper surface of them all has adown upon it, in however small quantity it may be; in somecountries this down is used as a kind of wool.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xviii. c. 68, where he enlarges still further on this assertedpeculiarity; he borrows his statement from Theophrastus, Hist. Plant.B. i. c. 16.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">These statements are quite conformable with the fact.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This statement is quite true, so far as the fact that the leaves havenot the same position in the day-time as during the night: the changes ofposition vary greatly, however, in the different kinds. It is generally thoughtthat an organic irritability is the cause of this phenomenon.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This seems to be the meaning of "In aliis gentium lana est." Healludes, probably, to cotton or silk: see B. vi. c. 20. Thunberg tells us thatat Roodesand, near the Cape of Good Hope, there grows so thick a downon the Buplevrum giganteum of Lamarck, that it is employed to imitate asort of white velvet, and is used for bonnets, gloves, stockings, &amp;c.</p></body>
