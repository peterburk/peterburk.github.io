The Emperor Nero ordered a painting of himselfto be executed upon canvass, of colossal proportions, onehundred and twenty feet in height; a thing till then unknown.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>This picture was just completed when it was burntby lightning, with the greater part of the gardens of Maius,in which it was exhibited.</p><p>A freedman of the same prince, on the occasion of his exhibitinga show of gladiators at Antium, had the public porticoshung, as everybody knows, with paintings, in whichwere represented genuine portraits of the gladiators and allthe other assistants. Indeed, at this place, there has been avery prevailing taste for paintings for many ages past. C.Terentius Lucanus was the first who had combats of gladiatorspainted for public exhibition: in honour of his grandfather,who had adopted him, he provided thirty pairs of gladiatorsin the Forum, for three consecutive days, and exhibited apainting of their combats in the Grove of Diana.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From the construction of the passage, it is difficult to say whether hemeans to say that such colossal figures were till then unknown in painting,or whether that the use of canvass in painting was till then unknown.If the latter is the meaning, it is not exactly correct, though it is probablethat the introduction of canvass for this purpose was comparatively late;there being no mention of its being employed by the Greek painters of thebest periods.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. iii. c. 9, B. xiv. c. 3, and B. xvi. c. 91.</p></body>
