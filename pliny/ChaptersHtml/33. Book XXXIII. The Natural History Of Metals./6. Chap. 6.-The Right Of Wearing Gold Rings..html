<div2 type="chapter" n="6" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 6.ÑTHE RIGHT OF WEARING GOLD RINGS.</head><p>It does not appear that rings were in common use before thetime of Cneius Flavius, the son of Annius. This Flavius wasthe first to publish a table<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> of the days for pleading,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> whichtill then the populace had to ascertain each day from a few<pb n="6077" />great personages.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> The son of a freedman only, and secretaryto Appius C¾cus,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> (at whose request, by dint of natural shrewdnessand continual observation, he had selected these days andmade them public),<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> he obtained such high favour with thepeople, that he was created curule ¾dile; in conjunction withQuintus Anicius Pr¾nestinus, who a few years before had beenan enemy to Rome,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> and to the exclusion of C. PÏtilius andDomitius, whose fathers respectively were of consular rank.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>The additional honour was also conferred on Flavius, of makinghim tribune of the people at the same time, a thing which occasionedsuch a degree of indignation, that, as we find stated inthe more ancient Annals, "the rings<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> were laid aside!"</p><p>Most persons, however, are mistaken in the supposition thaton this occasion the members of the equestrian order did thesame: for it is in consequence of these additional words, "thephaler¾,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> too, were laid aside as well," that the name of theequestrian order was added. These rings, too, as the Annalstell us, were laid aside by the nobility, and not<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> by the wholebody of the senate. This event took place in the consulshipof P. Sempronius and P. Sulpicius.<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> Flavius made a vowthat he would consecrate a temple to Concord, if he shouldsucceed in reconciling the privileged orders with the plebeians:and as no part of the public funds could be voted for the purpose,he accordingly built a small shrine of brass<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> in the Gr¾-<pb n="6078" />costasis,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> then situate above the Comitium,<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> with the fineswhich had been exacted for usury. Here, too, he had an inscriptionengraved upon a tablet of brass, to the effect that theshrine was dedicated two hundred and three years after theconsecration of the Capitol. Such were the events that happenedfour hundred and forty-nine years after the foundationof the City, this being the earliest period at which we findany traces of the common use of rings.</p><p>A second occasion, however, that of the Second Punic War,shows that rings must have been at that period in very generaluse; for if such had not been the case, it would have beenimpossible for Hannibal to send the three<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> modii of rings, whichwe find so much spoken of, to Carthage. It was through adispute, too, at an auction about the possession of a ring, thatthe feud first commenced between C¾pio<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> and Drusus,<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> a disputewhich gave rise to the Social War,<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> and the public disasterswhich thence ensued. Not even in those days, however,did all the senators possess gold rings, seeing that, in thememory of our grandsires, many personages who had evenfilled the pr¾torship, wore rings of iron to the end of theirlives; Calpurnius,<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> for example, as Fenestella tells us, andManilius, who had been legatus to Caius Marius in the JugurthineWar. Many historians also state the same of L.Fufidius, he to whom Scaurus dedicated the history of hislife.</p><p>In the family of the Quintii,<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> it is the usage for no one, notthe females even, ever to wear a ring; and even at the presentday, the greater part of the nations known to us, peopleswho are living under the Roman sway, are not in the habit of<pb n="6079" />wearing rings. Neither in the countries of the East,<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> norin Egypt, is any use made of seals, the people being contentwith simple writing only.<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span></p><p>In this, as in every other case, luxury has introduced variousfashions, either by adding to rings gems of exquisite brilliancy,and so loading the fingers with whole revenues, as we shallhave further occasion to mention in our Book on Gems;<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span> orelse by engraving them with various devices: so that it is inone instance the workmanship, in another the material, thatconstitutes the real value of the ring. Then again, in thecase of other gems, luxury has deemed it no less than sacrilegeto make a mark<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span> even upon them, and has caused them to be setwhole, that no one may suppose that the ring was ever intendedto be employed as a signet. In other instances, luxury haswilled that certain stones, on the side even that is concealed bythe finger, should not<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span> be closed in with gold, thus makinggold of less account than thousands of tiny pebbles. On theother hand again, many persons will admit of no gems beingset in their rings, but impress their seal with the gold<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span> itself,an invention which dates from the reign of Claudius C¾sar.At the present day, too, the very slaves even, incase their ironrings with gold (while other articles belonging to them, theydecorate with pure gold),<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span> a licence which first originated inthe Isle of Samothrace,<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span> as the name given to the inventionclearly shows.<pb n="6080" /></p><p>It was the custom at first to wear rings on a single finger<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span>only, the one, namely, that is next to the little finger; and thiswe see the case in the statues of Numa and Servius TulliusIn later times, it became the practice to put rings on the fingernext to the thumb, even in the case of the statues of the gods;and more recently, again, it has been the fashion to wear themupon the little finger<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span> as well. Among the peoples of Galliaand Britannia, the middle finger, it is said, is used for this purpose.At the present day, however, among us, this is the onlyfinger that is excepted, all the others being loaded with rings,smaller rings even being separately adapted for the smallerjoints of the fingers. Some there are who heap several ringsupon the little finger alone; while others, again, wear but onering upon this finger, the ring that sets a seal upon the signetringitself, this last being kept carefully shut up as an objectof rarity, too precious to be worn in common use, and only tobe taken from the cabinet<span id="ref_31"><a href="#note_31">[31]</a></span> as from a sanctuary. And thus isthe wearing of a single ring upon the little finger no morethan an ostentatious advertisement that the owner has propertyof a more precious nature under seal at home!</p><p>Some, too, make a parade of the weight of their rings, whileto others it is quite a labour<span id="ref_32"><a href="#note_32">[32]</a></span> to wear more than one at a time:some, in their solicitude for the safety of their gems, make thehoop of gold tinsel, and fill it with a lighter material than gold,thinking thereby to diminish the risks of a fall.<span id="ref_33"><a href="#note_33">[33]</a></span> Others, again,are in the habit of inclosing poisons beneath the stones oftheir rings, and so wear them as instruments of death; Demosthenes,for instance, that greatest of the orators of Greece.<span id="ref_34"><a href="#note_34">[34]</a></span>And then, besides, how many of the crimes that are stimulatedby cupidity, are committed through the instrumentality of<pb n="6081" />rings!<span id="ref_35"><a href="#note_35">[35]</a></span> How happy the times, how truly innocent, in whichno seal was ever put to anything! At the present day, on thecontrary, our very food even and our drink have to be preservedfrom theft<span id="ref_36"><a href="#note_36">[36]</a></span> through the agency of the ring: a result owing tothose legions of slaves, those throngs of foreigners which areintroduced into our houses, multitudes so numerous that werequire the services of a nomenclator<span id="ref_37"><a href="#note_37">[37]</a></span> even, to tell us thenames of our own servants. Very different was it in the timesof our forefathers, when each person possessed a single servantonly, one of his master's own lineage, called Marcipor orLucipor,<span id="ref_38"><a href="#note_38">[38]</a></span> from his master's name, as the case might be, andtaking all his meals with him in common; when, too, therewas no occasion for taking precautions at home by keeping awatch upon the domestics. But at the present day, we notonly procure dainties which are sure to be pilfered, but handsto pilfer them as well; and so far is it from being sufficient tohave the very keys sealed, that the signet-ring is often takenfrom off the owner's finger while he is overpowered with sleepor lying on his death-bed.<span id="ref_39"><a href="#note_39">[39]</a></span></p><p>Indeed the most important transactions of life are now madeto depend upon this instrument, though at what period this firstbegan to be the case, I am at a loss to say. It would appear,however, so far as foreign nations are concerned, that we mayadmit the importance attached to it, from the days of Polycrates,<span id="ref_40"><a href="#note_40">[40]</a></span>the tyrant of Samos, whose favourite ring, after being<pb n="6082" />thrown in the sea, was recovered from a fish that was caught;and this Polycrates, we know, was put to death<span id="ref_41"><a href="#note_41">[41]</a></span> about theyear of our City, 230. The use of the ring must, of necessity,have become greatly extended with the increase of usury;one proof of which is, the usage still prevalent among thelower classes, of whipping off the ring<span id="ref_42"><a href="#note_42">[42]</a></span> the moment a simplecontract is made; a practice which takes its date, no doubt,from a period when there was no more expeditious method ofgiving an earnest on closing a bargain. We may thereforevery safely conclude, that though money was first introducedamong us, the use of rings was introduced very shortly after.Of money, I shall shortly have occasion to speak further.<span id="ref_43"><a href="#note_43">[43]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Called the "Fasti;" probably because this was the first word of thetitle.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Dies fasti." These were the days on which the courts sat, and thePr¾tor, who was the chief judge, gave his decisions. The word "fasti"is derived from the ancient Latin "for," or from the old Greek word <foreign lang="greek">fa/w</foreign>,both signifying "to speak:" consequently the "dies fasti" were "thespeaking days," and the "dies nefasti" the "non-speaking days," inallusion to the restrictions put upon the judgments of the Pr¾tor.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This complex state of the Roman Calendar long remained one of thesources from which the priesthood and the patrician order derived theirpower and influence over the plebeians.
