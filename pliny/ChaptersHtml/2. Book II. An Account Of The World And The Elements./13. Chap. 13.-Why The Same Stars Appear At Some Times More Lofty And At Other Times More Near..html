<div2 type="chapter" n="13" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 13.—WHY THE SAME STARS APPEAR AT SOME TIMESMORE LOFTY AND AT OTHER TIMES MORE NEAR.</head><p>The above is an account of the aspects and the occultationsof the planets, a subject which is rendered very complicatedby their motions, and is involved in much that is wonderful;especially, when we observe that they change their size andcolour, and that the same stars at one time approach thenorth, and then go to the south, and are now seen near theearth, and then suddenly approach the heavens. If on thissubject I deliver opinions different from my predecessors, Iacknowledge that I am indebted for them to those individuals who first pointed out to us the proper mode of inquiry;let no one then ever despair of benefiting future ages.</p><p>But these things depend upon many different causes. Thefirst cause is the nature of the circles described by the stars,which the Greeks term <hi rend="ital">apsides</hi><span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>, for we are obliged to useGreek terms. Now each of the planets has its own circle,and this a different one from that of the world<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>; because theearth is placed in the centre of the heavens, with respect tothe two extremities, which are called the poles, and also in<pb n="1043" />that of the zodiac, which is situated obliquely between them.And all these things are made evident by the infallible resultswhich we obtain by the use of the compasses<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>. Hence theapsides of the planets have each of them different centres, andconsequently they have different orbits and motions, since itnecessarily follows, that the interior apsides are the shortest.</p><p>(16.) The apsides which are the highest from the centreof the earth are, for Saturn, when he is in Scorpio, for Jupiterin Virgo, for Mars in Leo, for the Sun in Gemini, for Venusin Sagittarius, and for Mercury in Capricorn, each of themin the middle of these signs; while in the opposite signs,they are the lowest and nearest to the centre of the earth<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>.Hence it is that they appear to move more slowly whenthey are carried along the highest circuit; not that theiractual motions are accelerated or retarded, these being fixedand determinate for each of them; but because it necessarilyfollows, that lines drawn from the highest apsis must approachnearer to each other at the centre, like the spokes of a wheel;and that the same motion seems to be at one time greater,and at another time less, according to the distance from thecentre.</p><p>Another cause of the altitudes of the planets is, that theirhighest apsides, with relation to their own centres, are indifferent signs from those mentioned above<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>. Saturn is inthe 20th degree of Libra, Jupiter in the 15th of Cancer,Mars in the 28th of Capricorn, the Sun in the 19th of Aries,Venus in the 27th of Pisces, Mercury in the 15th of Virgo,and the Moon in the 3rd of Taurus.</p><p>The third cause of the altitude depends on the form of theheavens, not on that of the orbits; the stars appearing tothe eye to mount up and to descend through the depth ofthe air<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>. With this cause is connected that which depends<pb n="1044" />on the latitude of the planets and the obliquity of the zodiac.It is through this belt that the stars which I have spoken ofare carried, nor is there any part of the world habitable, except what lies under it<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>; the remainder, which is at the poles,being in a wild desert state. The planet Venus alone exceedsit by 2 degrees, which we may suppose to be the cause whysome animals are produced even in these desert regions ofthe earth. The moon also wanders the whole breadth of thezodiac, but never exceeds it. Next to these the planet Mercury movesthrough the greatest space; yet out of the 12 degrees (for there areso many degrees of latitude in the zodiac<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>),it does not pass through more than 8, nor does it go equallythrough these, 2 of them being in the middle of the zodiac,4 in the upper part, and 2 in the lower part<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>. Next to thesethe Sun is carried through the middle of the zodiac, windingunequally through the two parts of his tortuous circuit<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>.The star Mars occupies the four middle degrees; Jupiterthe middle degree and the two above it; Saturn, like the<pb n="1045" />sun, occupies two<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>. The above is an account of the latitudes as they descend to the south or ascend to the north<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>.Hence it is plain that the generality of persons are mistakenin supposing the third cause of the apparent altitude todepend on the stars rising from the earth and climbing upthe heavens. But to refute this opinion it is necessary toconsider the subject with very great minuteness, and toembrace all the causes.</p><p>It is generally admitted, that the stars<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>, at the time oftheir evening setting, are nearest to the earth, both withrespect to latitude and altitude<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>, that they are at the commencement of both at their morning risings, and that theybecome stationary at the middle points of their latitudes,what are called the ecliptics<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>. It is, moreover, acknowledged, thattheir motion is increased when they are in thevicinity of the earth, and diminished when they are removedto a greater altitude<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span>; a point which is most clearly provedby the different altitudes of the moon. There is no doubtthat it is also increased at the morning risings<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span>, and that thethree superior planets are retarded, as they advance fromthe first station to the second. And since this is the case, it<pb n="1046" />is evident, that the latitudes are increased from the time oftheir morning risings, since the motions afterwards appearto receive less addition; but they gain their altitude in thefirst station, since the rate of their motion then begins todiminish<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span>, and the stars to recede.</p><p>And the reason of this must be particularly set forth.When the planets are struck by the rays of the sun, in the,situation which I have described, <hi rend="ital">i. e.</hi> in their quadrature,they are prevented from holding on their straight forwardcourse, and are raised on high by the force of the fire<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span>. Thiscannot be immediately perceived by the eye, and thereforethey seem to be stationary, and hence the term station isderived. Afterwards the violence of the rays increases, andthe vapour being beaten back forces them to recede.</p><p>This exists in a greater degree in their evening risings, thesun being then turned entirely from them, when they aredrawn into the highest apsides; and they are then the leastvisible, since they are at their greatest altitude and arecarried along with the least motion, as much less indeed asthis takes place in the highest signs of the apsides. At thetime of the evening rising the latitude decreases and becomesless as the motion is diminished, and it does not increaseagain until they arrive at the second station, when the altitude is also diminished; the sun's rays then coming fromthe other side, the same force now therefore propels themtowards the earth which before raised them into the heavens,from their former triangular aspect<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span>. So different is theeffect whether the rays strike the planets from below orcome to them from above. And all these circumstancesproduce much more effect when they occur in the eveningsetting. This is the doctrine of the superior planets; that<pb n="1047" />of the others is more difficult, and has never been laid downby any one before me<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span>.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"<foreign lang="greek">(Ayi\s,</foreign> ligneus rotæ circulus, ab <foreign lang="greek">a(/ptw</foreign> necto;"Hederic <hi rend="ital">in loco.</hi> Theterm is employed in a somewhat different sense by the modern astronomers, to signify the point in the orbit of a planet, when it is either at thegreatest or the least distance from the earth, or the body about which itrevolves; the former being termed the apogee, aphelion, or the higherapsis; the latter the perigee, perhelion, or lower apsis; Jennings on theGlobes, pp. 64, 65.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"mundo."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"ratione circini semper indubitata."</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In consequence of the precession of the equinoxes these points arecontinually advancing from W. to E., and are now about 30 degrees fromthe situation they were in when the observations were first made bythe modern astronomers.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Our author here probably refers to the motions of the planets throughtheir epicycles or secondary circles, the centres of which were supposedto be in the peripheries of the primary circles.
