<div2 type="chapter" n="32" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 32.ÑCONYZA.</head><p>There are two varieties of conyza, also, employed in making<pb n="4333" />chaplets, the male<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> plant and the female. The differenceconsists in the leaves, those of the female plant being thinner,more tapering, and narrower, and those of the male being ofan imbricated shape, the plant having a greater number ofbranches. The blossom, too, of the male plant is more vividthan that of the female: in both kinds it is late in making itsappearance, not till after the rising of Arcturus.</p><p>The smell of the male conyza is more powerful than thatof the female plant: the latter, however, is of a more penetratingnature, for which reason it is that the female plant isheld in higher esteem for the treatment of the bites of animals.The leaves of the female plant have exactly the smell of honey;and the root of the male has received the name of "libanotis"from some: we have already made mention<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> of it on a previous occasion.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">FŽe takes this to be the Inula viscosa of Desfontaines, and identifiesthe other kind with the Inula pulicaria of Linn¾us.
