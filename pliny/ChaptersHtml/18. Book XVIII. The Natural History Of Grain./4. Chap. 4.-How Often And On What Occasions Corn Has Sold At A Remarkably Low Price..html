<div2 type="chapter" n="4" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 4.—HOW OFTEN AND ON WHAT OCCASIONS CORN HAS SOLD AT A REMARKABLY LOW PRICE.</head><p>The consequence was, that when the Roman manners weresuch as these, the corn that Italy produced was sufficient forits wants, and it had to be indebted to no province for itsfood; and not only this, but the price of provisions was incredibly cheap. Manius Marcius, the ædile<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> of the people,was the first who gave corn to the people at the price of oneas for the modius. L. Minutius Augurinus,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> the same whodetected, when eleventh tribune of the people, the projects ofSpurius Mælius, reduced the price of corn on three marketdays,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> to one as per modius; for which reason a statue waserected in honour of him, by public subscription, without theTrigeminian Gate.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> T. Seius distributed corn to the people,<pb n="4008" />in his ædileship,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> at one as per modius, in remembrance ofwhich statues were erected in honour of him also in the Capitol and the Palatium: on the day of his funeral he was borne tothe pile on the shoulders of the Roman people. In the year,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>too, in which the Mother of the Gods was brought to Rome, theharvest of that summer, it is said, was more abundant than ithad been for ten years before. M. Yarro informs us, that in theyear<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> in which L. Metellus exhibited so many elephants inhis triumphal procession, a modius of spelt was sold for one as,which was the standard price also of a congius of wine, thirtypounds' weight of dried figs, ten pounds of olive oil, andtwelve pounds of flesh meat. Nor did this cheapness originatein the wide-spread domains of individuals encroaching continually upon their neighbours, for by a law proposed by Licinius Stolo, the landed property of each individual was limitedto five hundred jugera; and he himself was convicted underhis own law of being the owner of more than that amount,having as a disguise prevailed upon his son to lend him hisname. Such were the prices of commodities at a time whenthe fortunes of the republic were rapidly on the increase. Thewords, too, that were uttered by Manius Curius<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> after histriumphs and the addition of an immense extent of territoryto the Roman sway, are well known: "The man must belooked upon," said he, "as a dangerous citizen, for whomseven jugera of land are not enough;" such being the amountof land that had been allotted to the people after the expulsionof the kings.</p><p>What, then, was the cause of a fertility so remarkable asthis? The fact, we have every reason to believe, that inthose days the lands were tilled by the hands of generalseven, the soil exulting beneath a plough-share crowned withwreaths of laurel, and guided by a husbandman graced withtriumphs: whether it is that they tended the seed with thesame care that they had displayed in the conduct of wars, andmanifested the same diligent attention in the management oftheir fields that they had done in the arrangement of the camp,<pb n="4009" />or whether it is that under the hands of honest men everything prospers all the better, from being attended to with ascrupulous exactness. The honours awarded to Serranus<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>found him engaged in sowing his fields, a circumstance towhich he owes his surname.<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> Cincinnatus was ploughing hisfour jugera of land upon the Vaticanian Hill—the same that arestill known as the "Quintian Meadows,"<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> when the messenger brought him the dictatorship—finding him, the tradition says, stripped to the work, and his very face begrimedwith dust. "Put on your clothes," said he, "that I may deliver to you the mandates of the senate and people of Rome."In those days these messengers bore the name of "viator," or"wayfarer," from the circumstance that their usual employ-ment was to fetch the senators and generals from their fields.</p><p>But at the present day these same lands are tilled by slaveswhose legs are in chains, by the hands of malefactors and menwith a branded face! And yet the Earth is not deaf to ouradjurations, when we address her by the name of "parent,"and say that she receives our homage<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> in being tilled byhands such as these; as though, forsooth, we ought not to believe that she is reluctant and indignant at being tended insuch a manner as this! Indeed, ought we to feel any surprisewere the recompense she gives us when worked by chastisedslaves,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> not the same that she used to bestow upon the laboursof warriors?</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A.U.C. 298.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxxiv. c. 11.
