(8.)ÑCACHRYS.</head><p>The robur bears cachrys,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> too; such being the name given<pb n="3352" />to a small round ball that is employed in medicine for itscaustic properties. It grows on the fir likewise, the larch,the pitch-tree, the linden, the nut-tree, and the plane, andremains on the tree throughout the winter, after the leaves havefallen. It contains a kernel very similar to that of the pinenut, and increases in size during the winter. In spring theball opens throughout, and it finally drops when the leavesare beginning to grow.</p><p>Such is the multiplicity of the products borne by the roburin addition to its acorns; and not only these, but mushrooms<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>as well, of better or worse quality, the most recent stimulantsthat have been discovered for the appetite; these last are foundgrowing about its roots. Those of the quercus are the mosthighly esteemed, while those of the robur, the cypress, andthe pine are injurious.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> The robur produces mistletoe<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> also,and, if we may believe Hesiod,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> honey as well: indeed, it isa well-known fact, that a honey<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>-like dew falling from heaven, aswe have already mentioned,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> deposits itself upon the leaves ofthis tree in preference to those of any other. It is also wellknown that the wood of this tree, when burnt, produces anitrous<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> ash.<pb n="3353" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This word, as employed by Theophrastus, means a catkin, the Julusamentum of the botanists; but it is doubtful if Pliny attaches this meaningto the word, as the lime or linden-tree has no catkin, but an inflorescenceof a different character. It is not improbable that, under this name, healludes to some excrescence.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">These were the "boletus" and the suillus;" the last of which seemonly to have been recently introduced at table in the time of Pliny. SeeB. xxii. c. 47.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He alludes clearly to fungi of radically different qualities, as the nature of the trees beneath which they grow cannot possibly influence them,any further than by the various proportions of shade they afford. The soil,however, exercises great influence on the quality of the fungus; growingupon a hill, it may be innoxious, while in a wet soil it may be productiveof death.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See cc. 93, 94, and 95, of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Works and Days, 1. 230.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny seems to have here taken in a literal sense, what has been saidfiguratively by Virgil, Eel. iv. 1. 26:"Et dur¾ quercus sudabunt roscida mella;"<lb />and by Ovid, in relation to the Golden Age, Met. i. 113:"Flavaque de viridi stillabant ilice mella."<lb />FŽe remarks, that we find on the leaf of the lime-tree a thin, sugary deposit, left by insects; and that a species of manna exudes from the Conifer¾,as also the bark of the beech. This, however, is never the case with theoak.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">B. xi. c. 12.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">By this word, FŽe observes, we must not understand the word "nitre,"in the modern sense, but the sub-carbonate of potash; while the ashes oftrees growing on the shores of the sea produce a sub-carbonate of soda.</p></body>
