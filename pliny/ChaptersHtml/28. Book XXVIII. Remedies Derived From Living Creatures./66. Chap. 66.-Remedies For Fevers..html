Periodical<pb n="5355" />and recurrent fevers are cured, if we are to believe what themagicians tell us, by wearing the right eye of a wolf, salted,and attached as an amulet. There is one kind of fever generally known as "amphemerine"<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> it is to be cured, they say,by the patient taking three drops of blood from an ass's ear, andswallowing them in two semi-sextarii of water. For quartanfever, the magicians recommend cats' dung to be attached tothe body, with the toe of a horned owl, and, that the fevermay not be recurrent, not to be removed until the seventhparoxysm is past. Who,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> pray, could have ever made such adiscovery as this? And what, too, can be the meaning of thiscombination? Why, of all things in the world, was the toeof a horned owl made choice of?</p><p>Other adepts in this art, who are more moderate in theirsuggestions, recommend for quartan fever, the salted liver of acat that has been killed while the moon was on the wane, to betaken in wine just before the paroxysms come on. The magicians recommend, too, that the toes of the patient should berubbed with the ashes of burnt cow-dung, diluted with a boy'surine, and that a hare's heart should be attached to the hands;they prescribe, also, hare's rennet, to be taken in drink justbefore the paroxysms come on. New goats' milk cheese isalso given with honey, the whey being carefully extractedfirst.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. viii. c. 50.
