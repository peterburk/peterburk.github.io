The smoke, too, of burning chaffwill be an effectual protection against the effects of fogs, whenlikely to be injurious. Some persons recommend that three<pb n="4102" />crabs should be burnt<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> alive among the trees on which thevines are trained, to prevent these from being attacked by coalblight; while others say that the flesh of the silurus<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>should be burnt in a slow fire, in such a way that the smoke may bedispersed by the wind throughout the vineyard.</p><p>Varro informs us, that if at the setting of the Lyre, whichis the beginning of autumn, a painted grape<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> is consecrated inthe midst of the vineyard, the bad weather will not be pro-ductive of such disastrous results as it otherwise would.Archibius<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> has stated, in a letter to Antiochus,king of Syria, thatif a bramble-frog<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> is burried in a new earthen vessel, in themiddle of a corn-field, there will be no storms to cause injury.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Columella, De Arborib. c. 13, gives similar advice.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This absurd practice is mentioned in the Geoponica, B. v. c. 31.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">As to this fish, see B. ix. c. 17.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Uva picta" This absurdity does not seem to be found in any ofVarro's works that have come down to us.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Nothing whatever is known of him or his works; and, as Fée says,apparently the loss is little to be regretted.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Rubeta rana.</p></body>
