(4.)ÑTHE PELOPONNESUS.</head><p>The Peloponnesus, which was formerly called Apia<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> andPelasgia, is a peninsula, inferior in fame to no land upon theface of the earth. Situate between the two seas, the ®g¾anand the Ionian, it is in shape like the leaf of a plane-tree, inconsequence of the angular indentations made in its shores.According to Isidorus, it is 563 miles in circumference; andnearly as much again, allowing for the sea-line on themargin of its gulfs. The narrow pass at which it commencesis know by the name of the Isthmus. At this spot the twoseas, which we have previously mentioned, running from thenorth and the east, invade the land from opposite sides<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>,and swallow up its entire breadth, the result being thatthrough these inroads in opposite directions of such vastbodies of water, the sides of the land are eaten away to suchan extent, that Hellas<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> only holds on to the Peloponnesusby the narrow neck, five miles in width, which intervenes.The Gulfs thus formed, the one on this side, the other onthat, are known as the Corinthian<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and the Saronic Gulfs.The ports of Leche¾<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>, on the one side, and of Cenchre¾ onthe other, form the frontiers of this narrow passage, whichthus compels to a tedious and perilous circumnavigationsuch vessels as from their magnitude cannot be carried acrossby land on vehicles. For this reason it is that both King<pb n="1279" />Demetrius<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>, C¾sar the Dictator, the prince Caius<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>,and Domitius Nero<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>, have at different times made the attempt tocut through this neck by forming a navigable canal; a profane design,as may be clearly seen by the result<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> in everyone of these instances.</p><p>Upon the middle of this intervening neck which we havecalled the Isthmus, stands the colony of Corinth, formerlyknown by the name of Ephyre<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>, situate upon the brow of ahill, at a distance of sixty stadia from the shore of eithersea. From the heights of its citadel, which is called Acrocorinthos,or the "Heights of Corinth," and in which is theFountain of Pirene, it looks down upon the two seas whichlie in the opposite directions. From Leucas to Patr¾ uponthe Corinthian gulf is a distance of eighty-eight miles. Thecolony of Patr¾<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> is founded upon the most extensivepromontory of the Peloponnesus, facing ®tolia and the riverEvenus, the Corinthian Gulf being, as we have previously<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>stated, less than a mile in width at the entrance there,though extending in length as far as the isthmus, a distanceof eighty-five miles.<pb n="1280" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From Apis, the son of Phoroneus, or Telchines, according toPausanias.

The name of the latter is still preserved in themodern appellation Kechries, which is given to its ruins.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Demetrius Poliorcetes, king of Macedonia, son of Antigonus, king ofAsia.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Caius Caligula, the Emperor.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Emperor Nero actually commenced the work, having openedthe undertaking with great pomp, and cut away a portion of the earthwith his own hands.

Periander and HerodesAtticus also contemplated the formation of this channel.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is not known when it exchanged this name for that of Corinth; beingcalled by both names in Homer. Scarcely any remains of it are nowto be seen. The small town on its site is called Gortho, a corruption ofits ancient name. The water of the famed spring of Pirene is now onlyused for washing clothes.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Patras. There are few remains of the ancient city, which wasone of the twelve cities of Achaia.
