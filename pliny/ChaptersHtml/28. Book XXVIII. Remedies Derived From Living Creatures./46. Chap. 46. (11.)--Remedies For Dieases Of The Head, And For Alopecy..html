<div2 type="chapter" n="46" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 46. (11.)â€”-REMEDIES FOR DIEASES OF THE HEAD, ANDFOR ALOPECY.</head><p>Bears' grease,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> mixed with ladanum<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and the plant adiantum,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> prevents the hair from falling off; it is a cure alsofor alopecy and defects in the eyebrows, mixed with the fungusfrom the wick of a lamp, and the soot that is found in thenozzle. Used with wine, it is good for the cure of porrigo, amalady which is also treated with the ashes of deer's horns inwine: this last substance also prevents the growth of verminin the hair. For porrigo some persons employ goat's gall, incombination with Cimolian chalk and vinegar, leaving the prepration to dry for a time on the head. Sow's gall, too, mixedwith bull's urine, is employed for a similar purpose; and whenold, it is an effectual cure, with the addition of sulphur, forfurfuraceous eruptions. The ashes, it is thought, of an ass'sgenitals, will make the hair grow more thickly, and prevent itfrom turning grey; the proper method of applying it being toshave the head and to pound the ashes in a leaden mortar withoil. Similar effects are attributed to the genitals of an ass'sfoal, reduced to ashes and mixed with urine; some nard beingadded to render the mixture less offensive. In cases of alopecythe part affected is rubbed with bull's gall, warmed withEgyptian alum. Running ulcers of the head are successfullytreated with bull's urine, or stale human urine, in combinationwith cyclaminos<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and sulphur: but the most effectual remedy iscalf's gall, a substance which, heated with vinegar, has also theeffect of exterminating lice. Veal suet, pounded with salt andapplied to ulcers of the head, is a very useful remedy: the fat,too, of the fox is highly spoken of, but the greatest value isset upon cats' dung, applied in a similar manner with mustard.</p><p>Powdered goats' horns, or the horns reduced to ashes, thoseof the he-goat in particular, with the addition of nitre, tamarisk-seed, butter, and oil, are remarkably effectual for preventing the hair from coming off, the head being first shaved forthe purpose. So too, the ashes of burnt goats' flesh, applied<pb n="5335" />to the eye-brows with oil, impart to them a black tint. Byusing goats' milk, they say, lice may be exterminated; and thedung of those animals, with honey, is thought to be a cure foralopecy: the ashes, too, of the hoofs, mixed with pitch, preventthe hair from coming off.</p><p>The ashes of a burnt hare, mixed with oil of myrtle, alleviate head-ache, the patient drinking some water that hasbeen left in the trough after an ox or ass has been drinkingthere. The male organs of a fox, worn as an amulet, areproductive, if we choose to believe it, of a similar effect: thesame, too, with the ashes of a burnt deer's horn, applied withvinegar, rose oil, or oil of iris.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This substance still maintains its reputation, as preservative of thehair.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xii. c. 37. and B. xxvi. c. 30</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxii. c. 30.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxv. c. 67.</p></body>
