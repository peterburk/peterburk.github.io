<div2 type="chapter" n="21" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 21. (10.)ÑTREES OF THE ISLANDS OF THE PERSIAN SEA.THE COTTON TREE.</head><p>In the same gulf, there is the island of Tylos,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> covered witha forest<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> on the side which looks towards the East, where itis washed also by the sea at high tides. Each of the treesis in size as large as the fig; the blossoms are of an indescribable sweetness, and the fruit is similar in shape to a lupine,but so rough and prickly, that it is never touched by any animal. On a more elevated plateau of the same island, we findtrees that bear wool, but of a different nature from those of theSeres;<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> as in these trees the leaves produce nothing at all,and, indeed, might very readily be taken for those of the vine,<pb n="3118" />were it not that they are of smaller size. They bear a kind ofgourd, about the size of a quince;<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> which, when arrived atmaturity, bursts asunder and discloses a ball of down, fromwhich a costly kind of linen cloth is made.</p><p>(11.) This tree is known by the name of gossypinus:<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>the smaller island of Tylos, which is ten miles distant from thelarger one, produces it in even greater abundance.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">B. vi. c. 32.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">FŽe suggests that some kind of mangrove is probably alluded to, ofthe kind known as avicennia, or bruguiera.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. vi. c. 20</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Cotonei." To this resemblance of its fruit to the quince, the cotton-tree, which is here alluded to, not improbably owes its modern name.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The cotton-tree, or Gossypium arboreum of Linn¾us. It is worthyof remark, that Pliny copies here almost literally from Theophrastus. According to Philostratus, the byssus, or fine tissues worn by the Egyptianpriests, were made of cotton.</p></body>
