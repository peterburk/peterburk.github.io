<div2 type="chapter" n="5" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 5.—THE FIRST GREEK AUTHORS WHO WROTE UPON PLANTS.</head><p>Hence it is that other writers have confined themselves toa verbal description of the plants, indeed some of them havenot so much as described them even, but have contented themselves for the most part with a bare recital of their names,considering it sufficient if they pointed out their virtues andproperties to such as might Feel inclined to make further enquiries into the subject. Nor is this a kind of knowledgeby any means difficult to obtain; at all events, so far as regards myself, with the exception of a very few, it has beenmy good fortune to examine them all, aided by the scientificresearches of Antonius Castor,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> who in our time enjoyed thehighest reputation for an intimate acquaintance with thisbranch of knowledge. I had the opportunity of visiting hisgarden, in which, though he had passed his hundredth year, hecultivated vast numbers of plants with the greatest care.Though he had reached this great age, he had never experienced<pb n="5081" />any bodily ailment, and neither his memory nor his naturalvigour had been the least impaired by the lapse of time.</p><p>There was nothing more highly admired than an intimateknowledge of plants, in ancient times. It is long since themeans were discovered of calculating before-hand, not onlythe day or the night, but the very hour even at which aneclipse of the sun or moon is to take place; and yet the greaterpart of the lower classes still remain firmly persuaded thatthese phenomena are brought about by compulsion, through theagency of herbs and enchantments, and that the knowledge ofthis art is confined almost exclusively to females. Whatcountry, in fact, is not filled with the fabulous stories aboutMedea of Colchis and other sorceresses, the Italian Circe inparticular, who has been elevated to the rank of a divinityeven? It is with reference to her, I am of opinion, thatÆschylus,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> one of the most ancient of the poets, asserts thatItaly is covered with plants endowed with potent effects, andthat many writers say the same of Circeii,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> the place of herabode. Another great proof too that such is the case, is thefact, that the nation of the Marsi,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> descendants of a son ofCirce, are well known still to possess the art of taming serpents.</p><p>Homer, that great parent of the learning and traditions ofantiquity, while extolling the fame of Circe in many otherrespects, assigns to Egypt the glory of having first discoveredthe properties of plants, and that; too at a time when theportion of that country which is now watered by the riverNilus was not in existence, having been formed at a more recentperiod by the alluvion<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> of that river. At all events, he states<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>that numerous Egyptian plants were sent to the Helena of hisstory, by the wife of the king of that country, together withthe celebrated nepenthes,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> which ensured oblivion of allsorrows and forgetfulness of the past, a potion which Helenawas to administer to all mortals. The first person, however,of whom the remembrance has come down to us, as having<pb n="5082" />treated with any degree of exactness on the subject of plants,is Orpheus; and next to him Musæus and Hesiod, of whoseadmiration of the plant called polium we have already madesome mention on previous occasions.<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> Orpheus and Hesiodtoo we find speaking in high terms of the efficacy of fumigations. Homer also speaks of several other plants by name, ofwhich we shall have occasion to make further mention in theirappropriate places.</p><p>In later times again, Pythagoras, that celebrated philosopher,was the first to write a treatise on the properties of plants, awork in which he attributes the origin and discovery of themto Apollo, Æsculapius, and the immortal gods in general.Democritus too, composed a similar work. Both of these philosophers had visited the magicians of Persia, Arabia, Æthiopia,and Egypt, and so astounded were the ancients at their recitals,as to learn to make assertions which transcend all belief.Xanthus, the author of some historical works, tells us, in thefirst of them, that a young dragon<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> was restored to life by itsparent through the agency of a plant to which he gives thename of "ballis," and that one Tylon, who had been killed bya dragon, was restored to life and health by similar means.Juba too assures us that in Arabia a man was resuscitated bythe agency of a certain plant. Democritus has asserted—andTheophrastus believes it—that there is a certain herb inexistence, which, upon being carried thither by a bird, the nameof which we have already<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> given, has the effect, by the contactsolely, of instantaneously drawing a wedge from a tree, whendriven home by the shepherds into the wood.</p><p>These marvels, incredible as they are, excite our admirationnevertheless, and extort from us the admission that, makingall due allowance, there is much in them that is based ontruth. Hence it is too that I find it the opinion of mostwriters, that there is nothing which cannot be effected by theagency of plants, but that the properties of by far the greaterpart of them remain as yet unknown. In the number ofthese was Herophilus, a celebrated physician, a saying of whoseis reported, to the effect that some plants may possibly exercisea beneficial influence, if only trodden under foot. Be this asit may, it has been remarked more than once, that wounds and<pb n="5083" />maladies are sometimes inflamed<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> upon the sudden approach ofpersons who have been journeying on foot.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See end of B. xx.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There is little doubt that he alludes to the passage of Æschylus,quoted by Theophrastus, Hist.
