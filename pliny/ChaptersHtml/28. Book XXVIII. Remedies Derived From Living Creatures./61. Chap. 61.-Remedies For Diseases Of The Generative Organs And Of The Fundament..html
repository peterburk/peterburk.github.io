<div2 type="chapter" n="61" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 61.—REMEDIES FOR DISEASES OF THE GENERATIVE ORGANSAND OF THE FUNDAMENT.</head><p>For diseases of the fundament, a sovereign remedy is bear'sgall, mixed with the grease; to which some persons are in the<pb n="5351" />habit of adding litharge and frankincense. Butter, too, is verygood, employed with goose-grease and oil of roses. The proportions in which they are mixed will be regulated by thecircumstances of the case, care being taken to see that they areof a consistency which admits of their being easily applied.Bull's gall upon lint is a remarkably useful remedy, and hasthe effect of making chaps of the fundament cicatrize withgreat rapidity. Swellings of those parts are treated with vealsuet—that from the loins in particular—mixed with rue. Forother affections, goats' blood is used, with polenta. Goats'gall, too, is employed by itself, for the cure of condylomata, andsometimes, wolf's gall, mixed with wine.</p><p>Bears' blood is curative of inflamed tumours and apostemes upon these parts in general; as also bulls' blood, driedand powdered. The best remedy, however, is considered tobe the stone which the wild ass<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> voids with his urine, it issaid, at the moment he is killed. This stone, which is in asomewhat liquefied state at first, becomes solid when it reachesthe ground: attached to the thigh, it; disperses all collectionsof humours and all kinds of suppurations: it is but rarelyfound, however, and it is not every wild ass that produces it,but as a remedy it is held in high esteem. Asses' urine too,used in combination with gith, is highly recommended; theashes of a horse's hoof, applied with oil and water; a horse'sblood, that of a stone-horse in particular; the blood, also, of anox or cow, or the gall of those animals. Their flesh too, appliedwarm, is productive of similar results; the hoofs reduced toashes, and taken in water or honey; the urine of a she-goat;the flesh of a he-goat, boiled in water; the dung of theseanimals, boiled with honey; or else a boar's gall, or swine'surine, applied in wool.</p><p>Riding on horseback, we well know, galls and chafes theinside of the thighs: the best remedy for accidents of thisnature is to rub the parts with the foam which collects at ahorse's mouth. Where there are swellings in the groin, arising<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>from ulcers, a cure is effected by inserting in the sores threehorse-hairs, tied with as many knots.<pb n="5352" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Onager."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Arising, by sympathy, from sores in other parts of the body.</p></body>
