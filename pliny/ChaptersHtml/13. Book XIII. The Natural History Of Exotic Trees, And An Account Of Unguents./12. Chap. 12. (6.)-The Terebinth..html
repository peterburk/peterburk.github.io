This fruit is not larger than a bean, is of a veryagreeable smell, and sticky and resinous to the touch. AboutIda in Troas, and in Macedonia, this tree is short and shrubby,but at Damascus, in Syria, it is found of very considerable size.Its wood is remarkably flexible, and continues sound to a veryadvanced age: it is black and shining. The blossoms appearin clusters, like those of the olive-tree, but are of a red colour;the leaves are dense, and closely packed. It produces follicules, too, from which issue certain insects like gnats, as also akind of resinous liquid<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> which oozes from the bark.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pistacia terebinthus of Linnæus.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">These varieties, Fée says, are not observed by modern naturalists.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Garidel has remarked, that the trunk of this tree produces coriaceousvesicles, filled with a clear and odoriferous terebinthine, in which pucerons,or aphides, are to be seen floating.</p></body>
