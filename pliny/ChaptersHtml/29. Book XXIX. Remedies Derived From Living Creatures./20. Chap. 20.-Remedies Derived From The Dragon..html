Its head,placed beneath the threshold of a door, the gods being dulypropitiated by prayers, will ensure good fortune to the house,it is said. Its eyes, dried and beaten up with honey, form aliniment which is an effectual preservative against the terrorsof spectres by night, in the case of the most timorous even.The fat adhering to the heart, attached to the arm with adeer's sinews in the skin of a gazelle, will ensure success inlaw-suits, it is said; and the first joint of the vertebræ willsecure an easy access to persons high in office. The teeth,attached to the body with a deer's sinews in the skin of a roebuck, have the effect of rendering masters indulgent and potentates gracious, it is said.</p><p>But the most remarkable thing of all is a composition, bythe aid of which the lying magicians profess to render personsinvincible. They take the tail and head of a dragon, the hairsof a lion's forehead with the marrow of that animal, the foamof a horse that has won a race, and the claws of a dog's feet:these they tie up together in a deer's skin, and fasten themalternately with the sinews of a deer and a gazelle. It is,however, no better worth our while to refute such pretensionsas these, than it would be to describe the alleged remedies forinjuries inflicted by serpents, seeing that all these contrivancesare so many evil devices to poison<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> men's morals.</p><p>Dragon's fat will repel venomous creatures; an effect which isequally produced by burning the fat of the ichneumon.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> Theywill take to flight, also, at the approach of a person who hasbeen rubbed with nettles bruised in vinegar.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Some serpent of the boa species, probably.
