This done, it is enjoined that themilt should be covered up with mortar in the wall of thepatient's sleeping-room, and sealed with a ring, a charm<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> beingrepeated thrice nine times. A dog's milt, removed from theanimal while still alive, taken with the food, is a cure for diseases of the spleen: some, again, attach it fresh to that partof the patient's body. Others give the patient—without hisknowing it—the milt of a puppy two days old, to eat, insquill vinegar; the milt, too, of a hedge-hog is similarlyused. Ashes of burnt snails are employed, in combinationwith linseed, nettle-seed, and honey, the treatment being persisted in till the patient is thoroughly cured.</p><p>A green lizard has a remedial effect, suspended alive in anearthen vessel, at the entrance of the sleeping-room of thepatient, who, every time he enters or leaves it, must take careto touch it with his hand: the head, too, of a horned owl, reduced to ashes and incorporated with an unguent; honey, also,in which the bees have died; and spiders, the one known asthe "lycos"<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> in particular.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Carmen."
