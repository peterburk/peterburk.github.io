(20.)ÑINSTANCES OF EXTRAORDINARY STRENGTH.</head><p>Varro, speaking of persons remarkable for their strength,gives us an account of Tributanus, a celebrated gladiator,and skilled in the use of the Samnite<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> arms;<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> he was aman of meagre person, but possessed of extraordinary strength.Varro makes mention of his son also, who served in thearmy of Pompeius Magnus. He says, that in all parts of hisbody, even in the arms and hands, there was a network ofsinews,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> extending across and across. The latter of these men,having been challenged by an enemy, with a single finger ofthe right hand, and that unarmed,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> vanquished him, and then<pb n="2161" />seized and dragged him to the camp. Vinnius Valens, whoserved as a centurion in the pr¾torian guard of Augustus, wasin the habit of holding up waggons laden with casks, untilthey were emptied; and of stopping a carriage with one hand,and holding it back, against all the efforts of the horses todrag it forward. He performed other wonderful feats also, anaccount of which may still be seen inscribed on his monument.Varro, also, gives the following statement: "Fusius, whoused to be called the ' bumpkin<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> Hercules,' was in the habitof carrying his own mule; while Salvius was able to mounta ladder, with a weight of two hundred pounds attached to hisfeet, the same to his hands, and two hundred pounds on eachshoulder." I myself once saw,Ña most marvellous display ofstrength,Ña man of the name of Athanatus walk across thestage, wearing a leaden breast-plate of five hundred poundsweight, while shod with buskins of the same weight. WhenMilo, the wrestler, had once taken his stand, there was not aperson who could move him from his position; and when hegrasped an apple in his hand, no one could so much as openone of his fingers.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It would appear that the Samnites were not only one of the mostwarlike people, with whom the Romans had to contest in the infancy of theirstate, but that they were particularly celebrated as gladiators.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The gladiators, called Samnites, were armed with the peculiar "scutum," or oblong shield, used by the Samnites, a greave on the left leg, asponger on the breast, and a helmet with a crest.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The term "nervus" was generally applied by the ancients to thesinews or tendons; they had a very indistinct knowledge of what are properly called the "nerves."ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pintianus suggests another reading here, which would appear to be much more consistent with probability.
