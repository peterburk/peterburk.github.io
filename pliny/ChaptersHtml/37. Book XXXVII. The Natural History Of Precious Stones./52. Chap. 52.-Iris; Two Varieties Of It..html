It is partly composed of crystal, and hence it isthat some have called it "root of crystal." It takes its name"iris" from the properties which it possesses; for, whenstruck by the rays of the sun in a covered spot, it projects uponthe nearest walls the form and diversified colours of the rainbow;continually changing its tints, and exciting admirationby the great variety of colours which it presents. That it ishexahedral in form, like crystal, is generally agreed; but somesay that it is rough on the sides and of unequal angles;and that, when exposed to a full sun, it disperses the raysthat are thrown upon it, while at the same time, by throwingout a certain brightness<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> before it, it illumines all objectsthat may happen to be adjacent. The stone, however,as already stated, only presents these colours when undercover; not as though they were in the body of the stoneitself, but, to all appearance, as if they were the result of thereflected light upon the surface of the wall. The best kind isthe one that produces the largest arcs, with the closest resemblanceto the rainbow.</p><p>"Iritis" is the name of another stone, similar to the last inall other respects, but remarkable for its extreme hardness.Horus says, in his writings, that this stone, calcined and triturated,is a remedy for the bite of the ichneumon, and that it isa native of Persia.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Rainbow." Opinion seems divided as to whether this is Hyalin quartz iridized internally, or prismatic crystals of Limpid quartz, whichdecompose the rays of the sun.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The reading and meaning of this passage are very doubtful.</p></body>
