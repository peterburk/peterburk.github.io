(25.)—VIGOUR OF MIND</head><p>The most remarkable instance, I think, of vigour of mind inany man ever born, was that of Cæsar, the Dictator. I am notat present alluding to his valour and courage, nor yet his exalted genius, which was capable of embracing everything underthe face of heaven, but I am speaking of that innate vigourof mind, which was so peculiar to him, and that promptnesswhich seemed to act like a flash of lightning. We find it statedthat he was able to write or read, and, at the same time, todictate and listen. He could dictate to his secretaries fourletters at once, and those on the most important business; and,indeed, if he was busy about nothing else, as many as seven.He fought as many as fifty pitched battles, being the only commander who exceeded M. Marcellus,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> in this respect, he havingfought only thirty-nine.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> In addition, too, to the victoriesgained by him in the civil wars, one million one hundred andninety-two thousand men were slain by him in his battles.For my own part, however, I am not going to set it down as asubject for high renown, what was really an outrage committedupon mankind, even though he may have been acting underthe strong influence of necessity; and, indeed, he himselfconfesses as much, in his omission to state the number of personswho perished by the sword in the civil wars.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The conqueror of Syracuse, and five times consul at Rome.

He says that an individual,"who was raised over our heads and over all Europe, and so reigned muchtoo long," was personally engaged in nearly 300 battles.—B.</p></body>
