It is a singular fact in connexion with this discovery, that if more than one sextarius ofsalt is put into four sextarii of water, the liquefying properties of the water will be overpowered, and the salt will nolonger melt. On the other hand, again, a mixture of one sextarius of salt with four sextarii of water, acts as a good substitute for the efficacy and properties of the very saltest sea-water.The most reasonable proportion, however, is generally thoughtto be eight cyathi of salt, diluted in the quantity of waterabove mentioned; a preparation which has been found tohave a warming effect upon the sinews, without in any degreechafing the body.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The ancients being unable to analyze sea-water, could only imitate itvery clumsily.</p></body>
