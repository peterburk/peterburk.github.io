<div2 type="chapter" n="29" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 29.—THE CHENALOPEX, THE CHENEROS, THE TETRAO, ANDTHE OTIS.</head><p>To the goose genus belong also the chenalopex,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and thecheneros,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> a little smaller than the common goose, and whichforms the most exquisite of all the dainties that Britannia provides for the table. The tetrao<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> is remarkable for the lustreof its plumage, and its extreme darkness, while the eyelids areof a scarlet colour. Another species<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> of this last bird exceedsthe vulture in size, and is of a similar colour to it; and, indeed,there is no bird, with the exception of the ostrich, the body ofwhich is of a greater weight; for to such a size does it grow,that it becomes incapable of moving, and allows itself to betaken on the ground. The Alps and the regions of the Northproduce these birds; but when kept in aviaries, they lose theirfine flavour, and by retaining their breath, will die of merevexation. Next to these in size are the birds which inSpain they call the "tarda,"<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> and in Greece the "otis:" they<pb n="2501" />are looked upon however as very inferior food; the marrow,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>when disengaged from the bones, immediately emits a mostnoisome smell.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The "goose-fox," so called, according to Ælian, for its cunning andmischievous qualities; and worshipped by the Egyptians for its affectionfor its young.
