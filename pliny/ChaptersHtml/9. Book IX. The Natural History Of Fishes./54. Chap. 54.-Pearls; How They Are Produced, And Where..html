<div2 type="chapter" n="54" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 54.—PEARLS; HOW THEY ARE PRODUCED, AND WHERE.</head><p>The first rank then, and the very highest position among allvaluables, belongs to the pearl. It is the Indian Ocean thatprincipally sends them to us: and thus have they, amid thosemonsters so frightful and so huge which we have already described,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> to cross so many seas, and to traverse such lengthenedtracts of land, scorched by the ardent rays of a burning sun:and then, too, by the Indians themselves they have to be soughtin certain islands, and those but very few in number. Themost productive of pearls is the island of Taprobane, and thatof Stoidis, as already mentioned<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> in the description of the<pb n="2431" />world; Perimula,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> also, a promontory of India. But thoseare most highly valued which are found in the vicinity ofArabia,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> in the Persian Gulf, which forms a part of the RedSea.</p><p>The origin<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> and production of the shell-fish is not very different from that of the shell of the oyster. When the genialseason of the year<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> exercises its influence on the animal, it issaid that, yawning, as it were, it opens its shell, and so receivesa kind of dew, by means of which it becomes impregnated;and that at length it gives birth, after many struggles, to theburden of its shell, in the shape of pearls, which vary according to the quality of the dew. If this has been in a perfectlypure state when it flowed into the shell, then the pearl produced is white and brilliant, but if it was turbid, then thepearl is of a clouded colour also; if the sky should happen tohave been lowering when it was generated, the pearl will beof a pallid colour; from all which it is quite evident that thequality of the pearl depends much more upon a calm state ofthe heavens than of the sea, and hence it is that it contracts acloudy hue, or a limpid appearance, according to the degree ofserenity of the sky in the morning.</p><p>If, again, the fish is satiated in a reasonable time, then thepearl produced increases rapidly in size. If it should happento lighten at the time, the animal shuts its shell, and the pearlis diminished in size in proportion to the fast that the animalhas to endure: but if, in addition to this, it should thun-<pb n="2432" />der<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> as well, then it becomes alarmed, and closing the shell inan instant, produces what is known as a physema,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> or pearl-bubble, filled with air, and bearing a resemblance to a pearl,but in appearance only, as it is quite empty, and devoid ofbody; these bubbles are formed by the abortion of the shellfish. Those which are produced in a perfectly healthy stateconsist of numerous layers, so that they may be looked upon,not inappropriately, as similar in conformation to the callositieson the body of an animal; and they should therefore be cleanedby experienced hands. It is wonderful, however, that theyshould be influenced thus pleasurably by the state of the heavens, seeing that by the action of the sun the pearls are turnedof a red colour, and lose all their whiteness, just like the humanbody. Hence it is that those which keep their whiteness thebest are the pelagie, or main-sea pearls, which lie at toogreat a depth to be reached by the sun's rays; and yet theseeven turn yellow with age, grow dull and wrinkled, and itis only in their youth that they possess that brilliancy whichis so highly esteemed in them. When old, too, the coat growsthick, and they adhere to the shell,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> from which they canonly be separated with the assistance of a file.<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> Those pearlswhich have one surface flat and the other spherical, oppositeto the plane side, are for that reason called tympania,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> or tambour-pearls. I have seen pearls still adhering to the shell;for which reason the shells were used as boxes for unguents.In addition to these facts, we may remark that the pearl issoft<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> in the water, but that it grows hard the instant it istaken out.<pb n="2433" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In c. 2 of the present Book.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. vi. cc. 24 and 28.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. vi. c. 23.

Hence it is, thatthe finest of them come from the east, and are furnished by the kind ofbivalve, called by Linnæus, "Mytilus margaritiferus," which has the mostbeautiful mother of pearl in the interior that is known. The parts of theIndian sea which are mentioned by Pliny, are those in which the pearloyster is still found in the greatest abundance.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">All this theory, as Cuvier says, is totally imaginary.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Isidorus of Charax, in his description of Parthia, commended byAthenæus, B. iii., says, on the other hand, that the fish are aided in bringing forth, by rain and thunder.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From the Greek <foreign lang="greek">fush/ma,</foreign> "air—Bubble."</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It sometimes happens, Cuvier says, that the secretion which forms themother-of-pearl makes tubercles in the interior of the shell, which are thepearls adhering to the shell here spoken of.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Persius alludes to this in Sat. ii. 1. 66.
