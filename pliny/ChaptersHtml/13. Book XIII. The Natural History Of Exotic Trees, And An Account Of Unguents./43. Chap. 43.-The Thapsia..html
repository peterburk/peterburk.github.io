<div2 type="chapter" n="43" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 43.ÑTHE THAPSIA.</head><p>The seed of the ferula has been by some persons called"thapsia;"<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> deceived, no doubt, by what is really the fact,that the thapsia is a ferula, but of a peculiar kind, with leaveslike those of fennel, and a hollow stalk not exceeding a walking-stick in length; the seed is like that of the ferula, andthe root of the plant is white. When an incision is made inthe thapsia, a milky juice oozes from it, and, when pounded,it produces a kind of juice; the bark even is never thrown<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>away. All these parts of the shrub are poisonous, and, indeed, it is productive of injurious effects to those engaged indigging it up; for if the slightest wind should happen to beblowing towards them from the shrub, the body begins toswell, and erysipelas attacks the face: it is for this reason that,before beginning work, they anoint the face all over with asolution of wax. Still, however, the medical men say that,mixed with other ingredients, it is of considerable use in the<pb n="3206" />treatment of some diseases. It is employed also for the cureof scald-head, and for the removal of black and blue spotsupon the skin, as if, indeed, we were really at a loss for remedies in such cases, without having recourse to things of sodeadly a nature. These plants, however, act their part inserving as a pretext for the introduction of noxious agents;and so great is the effrontery now displayed, that people wouldabsolutely persuade one that poisons are a requisite adjunct tothe practice of the medical art.</p><p>The thapsia of Africa<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> is the most powerful of all. Somepersons make an incision in the stalk at harvest-time, and boreholes in the root, too, to let the juice flow; after it has become quite dry, they take it away. Others, again, pound theleaves, stalk, and root in a mortar, and after drying the juicein the sun, divide it into lozenges.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> Nero C¾sar, at the beginning of his reign, conferred considerable celebrity on thisplant. In his nocturnal skirmishes<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> it so happened that hereceived several contusions on the face, upon which heanointed it with a mixture composed of thapsia, frankincense,and wax, and so contrived the next day effectually to give thelie to all rumours, by appearing with a whole skin.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> It is awell-known fact, that fire<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> is kept alight remarkably well inthe hollow stalk of the ferula, and that for this purpose thoseof Egypt are the best.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Sprengel thinks that this is the Thapsia asclepium of the moderns;but FŽe takes it to be the Thapsia villosa of Linn¾us.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It was valued, Dioscorides says, for its cathartic properties.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Either the Thapsia garganica of Willdenow, or the Thapsia villosa,found in Africa and the south of Europe, though, as Pliny says, thethapsia of Europe is mild in its effects compared with that of Africa.
