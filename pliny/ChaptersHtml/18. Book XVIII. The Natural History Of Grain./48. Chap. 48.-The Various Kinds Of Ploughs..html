<div2 type="chapter" n="48" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 48.—THE VARIOUS KINDS OF PLOUGHS.</head><p>Ploughs are of various kinds. The coulter<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> is the iron partthat cuts up the dense earth before it is broken into pieces, andtraces beforehand by its incisions the future furrows, which theshare, reversed,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> is to open out with its teeth. Anotherkind—the common plough-share—is nothing more than a lever,furnished with a pointed beak; while another variety, which is onlyused in light, easy soils, does not present an edge projecting fromthe share-beam throughout, but only a small point at the extremity.In a fourth kind again, this point is larger and formedwith a cutting edge; by the agency of which implement, itboth cleaves the ground, and, with the sharp edges at the sides,cuts up the weeds by the roots. There has been invented, at acomparatively recent period, in that part of Gaul<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> known asRhætia, a plough with the addition of two small wheels, andknown by the name of "plaumorati."<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> The extremity of theshare in this has the form of a spade: it is only used, however,for sowing in cultivated lands, and upon soils which are nearlyfallow. The broader the plough-share, the better it is forturning up the clods of earth. Immediately after ploughing,the seed is put into the ground, and then harrows<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> with longteeth are drawn over it. Lands which have been sown in thisway require no hoeing, but two or three pairs of oxen are employed inploughing. It is a fair estimate to consider that asingle yoke of oxen can work forty jugera of land in the year,where the soil is light, and thirty where it is stubborn.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Fée remarks, that the plough here described differs but little fromthat used in some provinces of France.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Resupinus.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Gallia Togata.
