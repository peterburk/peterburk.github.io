THE FIG-TREE OFALEXANDRIA.</head><p>Egypt, too, has many trees which are not to be found elsewhere, and the kind of fig more particularly, which fur thisreason has been called the Egypitian fig.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> In leaf this treeresembles the mulberry-tree, as also in size and general appearance. It bears fruit, not upon branches, but upon the trunkitself: the fig is remarkable for its extreme sweetness, andhas no seeds<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> in it. This tree is also remarkable for its fruitfulness, which, however, can only be ensured by making incisions<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> in the fruit with hooks of iron, for otherwise it willnot come to maturity. But when this has been done, it mayhe gathered within fur days, immediately upon which anothershoots up in its place. Hence it is that in the year it producesseven abundant crops, and throughout all the summer there isan abundance of milky juice in the fruit. Even if the incisions are not made, the fruit will shoot afresh four timesduring the summer, the new fruit supplanting the old, andforcing it off before it has ripened. The wood, which is of avery peculiar nature, is reckoned among the most usefulknown. When cut down it is immediately plunged intostanding water, such being the means employed for drying<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> it.At first it sinks to the bottom, after which it begins to float,and in a certain length of time the additional moisture sucksit dry, which has the effect of penetrating and soaking all<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span><pb n="3181" />other kinds of wood. It is a sign that it is fit for use<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> whenit begins to float.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Ficus sycamorus of Linn¾us.
