<div2 type="chapter" n="49" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 49.—THE METHOD OF PREPARING WAX. THE BEST KINDSOF WAX. PUNIC WAX.</head><p>Wax is made<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> from the honeycombs after the honey hasbeen extracted. For this purpose, they are first cleaned withwater, and then dried three days in the shade: on the fourthday they are melted on the fire in a new earthen vessel, withsufficient water to cover them, after which the liquor is strainedoff in a wicker basket.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> The wax is then boiled again withthe same water and in the same pot, and poured into vessels ofcold water, the interior of which has been well rubbed withhoney. The best wax is that known as Punic<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> wax, the nextbest being that of a remarkably yellow colour, with the smellof honey. This last comes from Pontus, and, to my surprise,it is in no way affected by the poisonous honey which it has<pb n="4346" />contained.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> The next in quality is the Cretan wax, whichcontains the largest proportion of propolis,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> a substance ofwhich we have previously made mention when treating ofbees. Next to these varieties comes the Corsican wax, which,being the produce of the box-tree, is generally thought to bepossessed of certain medicinal properties.</p><p>The Punic wax is prepared in the following manner: yellowwax is first blanched in the open air, after which it is boiledin water from the open sea, with the addition of some nitre.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>The flower of the wax, or, in other words, the whitest part ofit, is then skimmed off with spoons, and poured into a vesselcontaining a little cold water. After this, it is again boiledin sea-water by itself, which done, the vessel is left to cool.When this operation has been three times repeated, the wax isleft in the open air upon a mat of rushes, to dry in the light ofthe sun and moon; for while the latter adds to its whiteness,the sun helps to dry<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> it. In order, however, that it may notmelt, it is the practice to cover it with a linen cloth: if, whenit has been thus refined, it is boiled once more, the result is awax of the greatest possible whiteness.</p><p>Punic wax is considered the best for all medicinal preparations. Wax is made black by the addition of ashes of papyrus, and a red colour is given to it by the admixture of alkanet; indeed, by the employment of various pigments, it ismade to assume various tints, in which state it is used formaking models,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> and for other purposes without number,among which we may mention varnishing walls<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> and armour,to protect them from the air. We have given the other particulars relative to bees and honey, when speaking<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> of thenature of those insects. We have now stated pretty nearlyall that we have to say on the subject of the pleasure garden.<pb n="4347" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The method here described differs but little from that employed atthe present day.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Sporta."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or Carthaginian.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In reality, the wax has properties totally different from those of thehoney, and it is not always gathered from the same plants.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A kind of bee-glue.
