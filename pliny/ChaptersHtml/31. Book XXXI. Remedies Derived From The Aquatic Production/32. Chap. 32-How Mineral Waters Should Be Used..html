<div2 type="chapter" n="32" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 32—HOW MINERAL WATERS SHOULD BE USED.</head><p>I am surprised that Homer has made no<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> mention of hotsprings, when, on the other hand, he has so frequently intro-duced the mention of warm baths: a circumstance from whichwe may safely conclude that recourse was not had in his timeto mineral waters for their medicinal properties, a thing souniversally the case at the present day. Waters impregnated<pb n="5495" />with sulphur are good for the sinews,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and aluminous watersare useful for paralysis and similar relaxations of the system.Those, again, which are impregnated with bitumen or nitre, thewaters of Cutilia,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> for example, are drunk as a purgative.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span></p><p>Many persons quite pride themselves on enduring the heatof mineral waters for many hours together; a most perniciouspractice, however, as they should be used but very little longerthan the ordinary bath, after which the bather should beshampooed<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> with cold water, and not leave the bath withoutbeing rubbed with oil. This last operation, however, is commonly regarded as altogether foreign to the use of mineral baths;and hence it is, that there is no situation in which men'sbodies are more exposed to the chances of disease, the headbecoming saturated with the intensity of the odours exhaled,and left exposed, perspiring as it is, to the coldness of theatmosphere, while all the rest of the body is immersed in thewater.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span></p><p>There is another mistake, also, of a similar description, madeby those who pride themselves upon drinking enormousquantities of these waters;<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> and I myself have seen persons,before now, so swollen with drinking it that the very rings ontheir fingers were entirely concealed by the skin, owing totheir inability to discharge the vast quantities of water whichthey had swallowed. It is for this reason, too, that thesewaters should never be drunk without taking a taste of saltevery now and then. The very mud,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> too, of mineral springsmay be employed to good purpose; but, to be effectual, afterbeing applied to the body, it must be left to dry in the sun.</p><p>It must not be supposed, however, that all hot waters are<pb n="5496" />of necessity medicated, those of Segesta in Sicily, for example,of Larissa, Troas, Magnesia, Melos, and Lipara. Nor is thevery general supposition a correct one, that waters, to be medicinal, must of necessity discolour copper or silver; no sucheffect being produced by those of Patavium,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> or there beingthe slightest difference perceptible in the smell.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny appears to have forgotten the warm springs of the Seamander,mentioned by Homer in the Iliad, B. xxii. 1. 147. <hi rend="ital">et seq.</hi></p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or rather, as Ajasson says, for cutaneous diseases.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. iii. c. 17.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In conformity with Sillig's suggestion, we reject "atque" as an interpolation.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Mulceri."</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In spite of what Pliny says, in some cases the use of a mineral bathis recommended for a long period of time together. At Leuk or Læch,for instance, in the Valais, the patients, Ajasson says, remain in the bathas much as eight hours together.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">To promote expectoration, Dalechamps says; or rather vomiting,according to Holland.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This substance, Ajasson says, is still used in medicine; that of thewaters of Silvanez, for example, in the department of Aveyron, is highlycelebrated for the cure of inveterate ulcers and sciatica. The mud baths,too, of Saint Arnand, enjoy an European reputation.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. ii c. 106.</p></body>
