<div2 type="chapter" n="74" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 74. (12.)ÑPRECIOUS STONES THAT SUDDENLY MAKE THEIRAPPEARANCE. COCHLIDES.</head><p>New species of precious stones are repeatedly brought intoexistence, and fresh ones are found all at once, destitute ofnames. Thus, for example, there was a stone formerly discoveredin the gold-mines of Lampsacus, which, on account ofits extraordinary beauty, was sent to King Alexander, as welearn from Theophrastus.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> Cochlides,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> too, which are now socommon, are rather artificial productions than natural, and inArabia there have been found vast masses of them; which areboiled, it is said, in honey, for seven days and nights withoutintermission. By doing this, all earthy and faulty particlesare removed; after which, the mass, thus cleansed and purified,is adorned by the ingenuity of artists with variegated veins andspots, and cut into such shapes as may be most to the taste ofpurchasers. Indeed, these articles, in former times, were made<pb n="6462" />of so large a size, that they were employed in the East asfrontals for the horses of kings, and as pendants for their trappings.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span></p><p>All precious stones in general are improved in brilliancy bybeing boiled in honey, Corsican honey more particularly; butacrid substances are in every respect injurious to them. Asto the stones which are variegated, and to which new coloursare imparted by the inventive ingenuity of man, as they haveno name in common use, they are usually known by that of"physis;"<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> a name which claims for them, as it were, that admirationwhich we are more ready to bestow upon the worksof Nature. But really, these artificial stones have nameswithout end, and I could never think of recounting the infiniteseries of them, coined as they have been by the frivolous tendenciesof the Greeks.</p><p>Having already described the more noble gems, and indeedthose of inferior quality which are found among the stones thatare held in high esteem, I must content myself with knowingthat I have pointed out those kinds which are the most deservingof mention. It will be as well, however, for the reader tobear in mind, that, according to the varying number of thespots and inequalities on their surface, according to the numerousintersections of lines and their multiplied tints and shades,the names of precious stones are subject to repeated changes;the material itself, for the most part, remaining just the same.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">De Lapidibus.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He alludes to petrified shells, most probably.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Phaler¾."
