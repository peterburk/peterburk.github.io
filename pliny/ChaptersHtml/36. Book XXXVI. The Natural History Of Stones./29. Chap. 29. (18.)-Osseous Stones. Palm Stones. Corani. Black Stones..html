<div2 type="chapter" n="29" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 29. (18.)—OSSEOUS STONES. PALM STONES. CORANI.BLACK STONES.</head><p>Theophrastus and Mucianus are of opinion that there arecertain stones which bring<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> forth other stones. Theophrastusstates, also, that a fossil<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> ivory is found, both white andblack; that the earth, too, produces bones, and that osseous<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>stones are sometimes found. In the vicinity of Munda inSpain, the place where the Dictator Cæsar defeated Pompeius,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>there are stones found, which, when broken asunder, bear theimpression of palm leaves.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span></p><p>There are some black stones, also, which are held in muchthe same esteem as the marbles; the Tænarian<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> stone, forexample. Varro says that the black stone of Africa is moredurable than that of Italy; while, on the other hand, the whitecorani<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> are harder than Parian marble. He states, also, that<pb n="6359" />the silex of Luna admits of being cut with a saw; that thatof Tusculum decrepitates in the fire; that the tawny silex ofthe Sabine districts, with the addition of oil, will yield a flameeven; and that, at Volsinii, molar stones<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> for grinding arefound. Among the prodigies that have happened, I find mentionmade of millstones that have moved of themselves.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Democritus, amongst the ancients, and Savonarola and Cardan, in morerecent times, have attributed to stones the powers of reproduction. Vivèsspeaks of certain diamonds which conceive and fructify; and Avicennaspeaks of the selenite or moon-stone of Arabia, which, when suspendedfrom a tree, generates other stones of a similar nature. Tournefort alsoentertained similar opinions.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Fossil teeth of mammiferæ, probably.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Fossil animal remains, no doubt.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cneius Pompeius.
