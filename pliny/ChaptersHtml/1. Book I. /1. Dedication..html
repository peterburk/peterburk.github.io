PLINIUS SECUNDUS TO HIS FRIEND TITUS VESPASIAN.</p><p>THIS treatise on Natural History, a novel work in Romanliterature, which I have just completed, I have taken theliberty to dedicate to you, most gracious<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> Emperor, an appellation peculiarly suitable to you, while, on account of hisage, that of <hi rend="ital">great</hi> is more appropriate to your Father;—<lb />"For still thou ne'er wouldst quite despise<lb />The trifles that I write<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>;"<lb />if I may be allowed to shelter myself under the example ofCatullus, my fellow-countryman<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>, a military term, which youwell understand. For he, as you know, when his napkinshad been changed<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, expressed himself a little harshly, from<pb n="1002" />his anxiety to show his friendship for his dear little <hi rend="ital">Veranius</hi>and <hi rend="ital">Fabius</hi><span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>. At the same time this my importunity mayeffect, what you complained of my not having done in another too forward epistle of mine; it will put upon record,and let all the world know, with what kindness you exercisethe imperial dignity. You, who have had the honour of atriumph, and of the censorship, have been six times consul,and have shared in the tribunate; and, what is still morehonourable, whilst you held them in conjunction with yourFather, you have presided over the Equestrian order, andbeen the Prefect of the Prætorians<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>: all this you have donefor the service of the Republic, and, at the same time, haveregarded me as a fellow-soldier and a messmate. Nor hasthe extent of your prosperity produced any change in you,except that it has given you the power of doing good to theutmost of your wishes. And whilst all these circumstancesincrease the veneration which other persons feel for you,with respect to myself, they have made me so bold, as to wishto become more familiar. You must, therefore, place thisto your own account, and blame yourself for any fault of thiskind that I may commit.</p><p>But, although I have laid aside my blushes<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>, I have notgained my object; for you still awe me, and keep me at adistance, by the majesty of your understanding. In no onedoes the force of eloquence and of tribunitian oratory blazeout more powerfully! With what glowing language do youthunder forth the praises of your Father! How dearly doyou love your Brother! How admirable is your talent forpoetry! What a fertility of genius do you possess, so as to<pb n="1003" />enable you to imitate your Brother<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>! But who is there thatis bold enough to form an estimate on these points, if he isto be judged by you, and, more especially, if you are challenged to do so? For the case of those who merely publishtheir works is very different from that of those who expressly dedicate them to you. In the former case I mightsay, Emperor! why do you read these things? They arewritten only for the common people, for farmers or mechanics, or for those who have nothing else to do; why do youtrouble yourself with them? Indeed, when I undertookthis work, I did not expect that you would sit in judgementupon me<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>; I considered your situation much too elevatedfor you to descend to such an office. Besides, we possess theright of openly rejecting the opinion of men of learning.M. Tullius himself, whose genius is beyond all competition,uses this privilege; and, remarkable as it may appear, employs anadvocate in his own defence:—"I do not write forvery learned people; I do not wish my works to be read byManius Persius, but by Junius Congus<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>." And if Lucilius,who first introduced the satirical style<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>, applied such a remark to himself, and if Cicero thought proper to borrow it,and that more especially in his treatise "De Republica,"how much reason have I to do so, who have such a judge todefend myself against! And by this dedication I have deprived myself of the benefit of challenge<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>; for it is a verydifferent thing whether a person has a judge given him bylot, or whether he voluntarily selects one; and we alwaysmake more preparation for an invited guest, than for onethat comes in unexpectedly.<pb n="1004" /></p><p>When the candidates for office, during the heat of thecanvass, deposited the fine<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> in the hands of Cato, that determined opposer of bribery, rejoicing as he did in his beingrejected from what he considered to be foolish honours, theyprofessed to do this out of respect to his integrity; thegreatest glory which a man could attain. It was on thisoccasion that Cicero uttered the noble ejaculation, "Howhappy are you, Marcus Porcius, of whom no one dares toask what is dishonourable<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>!" When L. Scipio Asiaticusappealed to the tribunes, among whom was Gracchus, heexpressed full confidence that he should obtain an acquittal,even from a judge who was his enemy. Hence it follows,that he who appoints his own judge must absolutely submitto the decision; this choice is therefore termed an appeal<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>.</p><p>I am well aware, that, placed as you are in the higheststation, and gifted with the most splendid eloquence andthe most accomplished mind, even those who come to paytheir respects to you, do it with a kind of veneration: onthis account I ought to be careful that what is dedicated toyou should be worthy of you. But the country people, and,indeed, some whole nations offer milk to the Gods<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span>, and thosewho cannot procure frankincense substitute in its place saltedcakes; for the Gods are not dissatisfied when they are worshiped by every one to the best of his ability. But mytemerity will appear the greater by the consideration, thatthese volumes, which I dedicate to you, are of such inferiorimportance. For they do not admit of the display of genius,nor, indeed, is mine one of the highest order; they admit ofno excursions, nor orations, nor discussions, nor of any wonderful adventures, nor any variety of transactions, nor, fromthe barrenness of the matter, of anything particularly pleasant in the narration, or agreeable to the reader. The na-<pb n="1005" />ture of things, and life as it actually exists, are described inthem; and often the lowest department of it; so that, invery many cases, I am obliged to use rude and foreign, oreven barbarous terms, and these often require to be introduced by a kind of preface. And, besides this, my road isnot a beaten track, nor one which the mind is much disposedto travel over. There is no one among us who has ever attempted it, nor is there any one individual among the Greekswho has treated of all the topics. Most of us seek for nothing but amusement in our studies, while others are fondof subjects that are of excessive subtilty, and completely involved in obscurity. My object is to treat of all those thingswhich the Greeks include in the Encyclopædia<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span>, which, however, are either not generally known or are rendered dubiousfrom our ingenious conceits. And there are other matterswhich many writers have given so much in detail that wequite loathe them. It is, indeed, no easy task to give noveltyto what is old, and authority to what is new; brightness towhat is become tarnished, and light to what is obscure; torender what is slighted acceptable, and what is doubtfulworthy of our confidence; to give to all a natural manner,and to each its peculiar nature. It is sufficiently honourable and glorious to have been willing even to make the attempt, although it should prove unsuccessful. And, indeed,I am of opinion, that the studies of those are more especiallyworthy of our regard, who, after having overcome all difficulties, prefer the useful office of assisting others to themere gratification of giving pleasure; and this is what I havealready done in some of my former works. I confess it surprises me, that T. Livius, so celebrated an author as he is,in one of the books of his history of the city from its origin,should begin with this remark, "I have now obtained a sufficient reputation, so that I might put an end to my work,did not my restless mind require to be supported by employment<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span>." Certainly he ought to have composed this work,not for his own glory, but for that of the Roman name, and<pb n="1006" />of the people who were the conquerors of all other nations.It would have been more meritorious to have persevered inhis labours from his love of the work, than from the gratification which it afforded himself, and to have accomplishedit, not for his own sake, but for that of the Roman people.</p><p>I have included in thirty-six<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> books 20,000 topics, allworthy of attention, (for, as Domitius Piso<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> says, we oughtto make not merely books, but valuable collections,) gainedby the perusal of about 2000 volumes, of which a few onlyare in the hands of the studious, on account of the obscurityof the subjects, procured by the careful perusal of 100 selectauthors<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span>; and to these I have made considerable additionsof things, which were either not known to my predecessors,or which have been lately discovered. Nor can I doubtbut that there still remain many things which I have omitted;for I am a mere mortal, and one that has many occupations.I have, therefore, been obliged to compose this work at interrupted intervals, indeed during the night, so that you willfind that I have not been idle even during this period. Theday I devote to you, exactly portioning out my sleep to thenecessity of my health, and contenting myself with this reward, thatwhile we are musing<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> on these subjects (according to the remark ofVarro), we are adding to the length ofour lives; for life properly consists in being awake.</p><p>In consideration of these circumstances and these difficulties, I dare promise nothing; but you have done me themost essential service in permitting me to dedicate my workto you. Nor does this merely give a sanction to it, but itdetermines its value; for things are often conceived to be ofgreat value, solely because they are consecrated in temples.</p><p>I have given a full account of all your family—your<pb n="1007" />Father, yourself, and your Brother, in a history of our owntimes, beginning where Aufidius Bassus concludes<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span>. Youwill ask, Where is it? It has been long completed and itsaccuracy confirmed<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span>; but I have determined to commit thecharge of it to my heirs, lest I should have been suspected,during my lifetime, of having been unduly influenced byambition. By this means I confer an obligation on thosewho occupy the same ground with myself; and also onposterity, who, I am aware, will contend with me, as I havedone with my predecessors.</p><p>You may judge of my taste from my having inserted, inthe beginning of my book, the names of the authors that Ihave consulted. For I consider it to be courteous and toindicate an ingenuous modesty, to acknowledge the sourceswhence we have derived assistance, and not to act as mostof those have done whom I have examined. For I mustinform you, that in comparing various authors with eachother, I have discovered, that some of the most grave and ofthe latest writers have transcribed, word for word, fromformer works, without making any acknowledgement; notavowedly rivalling them, in the manner of Virgil, or withthe candour of Cicero, who, in his treatise "De Republica<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span>,"professes to coincide in opinion with Plato, and in his Essayon Consolation for his Daughter, says that he followsCrantor, and, in his Offices<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span>, Panæcius; volumes, which, as youwell know, ought not merely to be always in our hands, butto be learned by heart. For it is indeed the mark of a perverted mindand a bad disposition, to prefer being caught in<pb n="1008" />a theft to returning what we have borrowed, especiallywhen we have acquired capital, by usurious interest<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span>.</p><p>The Greeks were wonderfully happy in their titles. Onework they called <foreign lang="greek">Khri/on,</foreign> which means that it was as sweetas a honeycomb; another <foreign lang="greek">Ke/ras )Amalqei/as,</foreign> or Cornu copiæ,so that you might expect to get even a draught of pigeon'smilk from it<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span>. Then they have their Flowers, their Muses,Magazines, Manuals, Gardens, Pictures, and Sketches<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span>, allof them titles for which a man might be tempted even toforfeit his bail. But when you enter upon the works, Oye Gods and Goddesses! how full of emptiness! Our dullercountrymen have merely their Antiquities, or their Examples,or their Arts. I think one of the most humorous of them hashis Nocturnal Studies<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span>, a term employed by Bibaculus; a namewhich he richly deserved<span id="ref_31"><a href="#note_31">[31]</a></span>. Varro, indeed, is not much behind him,when he calls one of his satires A Trick and a Half,and another Turning the Tables<span id="ref_32"><a href="#note_32">[32]</a></span>. Diodorus was the firstamong the Greeks who laid aside this trifling manner andnamed his history The Library<span id="ref_33"><a href="#note_33">[33]</a></span>. Apion, the grammarian,indeed—he whom Tiberius Cæsar called the Trumpeter ofthe World, but would rather seem to be the Bell of theTown-crier<span id="ref_34"><a href="#note_34">[34]</a></span>,—supposed that every one to whom he inscribedany work would thence acquire immortality. I do not regretnot having given my work a more fanciful title.</p><p>That I may not, however, appear to inveigh so completelyagainst the Greeks, I should wish to be considered underthe same point of view with those inventors of the arts of<pb n="1009" />painting and sculpture, of whom you will find an accountin these volumes, whose works, although they are so perfectthat we are never satisfied with admiring them, are inscribedwith a temporary title<span id="ref_35"><a href="#note_35">[35]</a></span>, such as "Apelles, or Polycletus, wasdoing this;" implying that the work was only commencedand still imperfect, and that the artist might benefit by thecriticisms that were made on it and alter any part thatrequired it, if he had not been prevented by death. It isalso a great mark of their modesty, that they inscribed theirworks as if they were the last which they had executed, andas still in hand at the time of their death. I think there arebut three works of art which are inscribed positively withthe words "such a one executed this;" of these I shall givean account in the proper place. In these cases it appears,that the artist felt the most perfect satisfaction with his work,and hence these pieces have excited the envy of every one.</p><p>I, indeed, freely admit, that much may be added to myworks; not only to this, but to all which I have published.By this admission I hope to escape from the carping critics<span id="ref_36"><a href="#note_36">[36]</a></span>,and I have the more reason to say this, because I hearthat there are certain Stoics and Logicians<span id="ref_37"><a href="#note_37">[37]</a></span>, and also Epicureans(from the Grammarians<span id="ref_38"><a href="#note_38">[38]</a></span> I expected as much), whoare big with something against the little work I publishedon Grammar<span id="ref_39"><a href="#note_39">[39]</a></span>; and that they have been carrying theseabortions for ten years together—a longer pregnancy thisthan the elephant's<span id="ref_40"><a href="#note_40">[40]</a></span>. But I well know, that even a womanonce wrote against Theophrastus, a man so eminent for hiseloquence that he obtained his name, which signifies the<pb n="1010" />Divine speaker<span id="ref_41"><a href="#note_41">[41]</a></span>, and that from this circumstance originatedthe proverb of choosing a tree to hang oneself<span id="ref_42"><a href="#note_42">[42]</a></span>.</p><p>I cannot refrain from quoting the words of Cato the censor,which are so pertinent to this point. It appears from them,that even Cato, who wrote commentaries on military discipline<span id="ref_43"><a href="#note_43">[43]</a></span>, and who had learned the military art under Africanus,or rather under <placeName key="tgn,2079879" authname="tgn,2079879">Hannibal</placeName> (for he could not endure Africanus<span id="ref_44"><a href="#note_44">[44]</a></span>, who, when he was his general, had borne away thetriumph from him), that <placeName key="tgn,2226609" authname="tgn,2226609">Cato</placeName>, I say, was open to the attacksof such as caught at reputation for themselves by detractingfrom the merits of others. And what does he say in hisbook? "I know, that when I shall publish what I have written, there will be many who will do all they can to depreciate it, and, especially, such as are themselves void ofall merit; but I let their harangues glide by me." Nor wasthe remark of Plancus<span id="ref_45"><a href="#note_45">[45]</a></span> a bad one, when Asinius Pollio<span id="ref_46"><a href="#note_46">[46]</a></span> wassaid to be preparing an oration against him, which was tobe published either by himself or his children, after thedeath of Plancus, in order that he might not be able toanswer it: "It is only ghosts that fight with the dead."This gave such a blow to the oration, that in the opinion of<pb n="1011" />the learned generally, nothing was ever thought more scandalous. Feeling myself, therefore, secure against these vileslanderers<span id="ref_47"><a href="#note_47">[47]</a></span>, a name elegantly composed by <placeName key="tgn,2226609" authname="tgn,2226609">Cato</placeName>, to expresstheir slanderous and vile disposition (for what other objecthave they, but to wrangle and breed quarrels?), I will proceed with my projected work.</p><p>And because the public good requires that you should bespared as much as possible from all trouble, I have subjoinedto this epistle the contents of each of the following books<span id="ref_48"><a href="#note_48">[48]</a></span>,and have used my best endeavours to prevent your beingobliged to read them all through. And this, which wasdone for your benefit, will also serve the same purpose forothers, so that any one may search for what he wishes, andmay know where to find it. This has been already doneamong us by Valerius Soranus, in his work which he entitled "On Mysteries<span id="ref_49"><a href="#note_49">[49]</a></span>."</p><p>The 1st book is the Preface of the Work, dedicated toTitus Vespasian Cæsar.</p><p>The 2nd is on the World, the Elements, and the HeavenlyBodies<span id="ref_50"><a href="#note_50">[50]</a></span>.</p><p>The 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th books are on Geography, inwhich is contained an account of the situation of thedifferent countries, the inhabitants, the seas, towns,harbours, mountains, rivers, and dimensions, and thevarious tribes, some of which still exist and others havedisappeared.</p><p>The 7th is on Man, and the Inventions of Man.</p><p>The 8th on the various kinds of Land Animals.</p><p>The 9th on Aquatic Animals.</p><p>The 10th on the various kinds of Birds.<pb n="1012" /></p><p>The 11th on Insects.</p><p>The 12th on Odoriferous Plants.</p><p>The 13th on Exotic Trees.</p><p>The 14th on Vines.</p><p>The 15th on Fruit Trees.</p><p>The 16th on Forest Trees.</p><p>The 17th on Plants raised in nurseries or gardens.</p><p>The 18th on the nature of Fruits and the Cerealia, andthe pursuits of the Husbandman.</p><p>The 19th on Flax, Broom<span id="ref_51"><a href="#note_51">[51]</a></span>, and Gardening.</p><p>The 20th on the Cultivated Plants that are proper forfood and for medicine.</p><p>The 21st on Flowers and Plants that are used for makingGarlands.</p><p>The 22nd on Garlands, and Medicines made from Plants.</p><p>The 23rd on Medicines made from Wine and from cultivated Trees.</p><p>The 24th on Medicines made from Forest Trees.</p><p>The 25th on Medicines made from Wild Plants.</p><p>The 26th on New Diseases, and Medicines made, for certain Diseases, from Plants.</p><p>The 27th on some other Plants and Medicines.</p><p>The 28th on Medicines procured from Man and from largeAnimals.</p><p>The 29th on Medical Authors, and on Medicines fromother Animals.</p><p>The 30th on Magic, and Medicines for certain parts of theBody.</p><p>The 31st on Medicines from Aquatic Animals.</p><p>The 32nd on the other properties of Aquatic Animals.</p><p>The 33rd on Gold and Silver.</p><p>The 34th on Copper and Lead, and the workers of Copper.</p><p>The 35th on Painting, Colours, and Painters.</p><p>The 36th on Marbles and Stones.</p><p>The 37th on Gems.<pb n="1013" /></p></div2></div1><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Jucundissime;" it is not easy to find an epithet in our languagewhich will correctly express the meaning of the original, affectionate andfamiliar, at the same time that it is sufficiently dignified and respectful.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Lamb's trans.; Carm. i. 4. of the original.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Conterraneus;" we have no word in English which expresses theidea intended by the original, and which is, at the same time, a militaryterm.
