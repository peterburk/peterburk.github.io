<div2 type="chapter" n="52" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 52.—AT WHAT PERIOD SILVER CHARGERS OF ENORMOUSSIZE WERE FIRST MADE. WHEN SILVER WAS FIRST USED ASA MATERIAL FOR SIDEBOARDS. WHEN THE SIDEBOARDS CALLEDTYMPANA WERE FIRST INTRODUCED.</head><p>In fact, it was but very shortly before that period that thesecouches were invented, as well as chargers<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> of silver, onehundred pounds in weight: of which last, it is a well-knownfact, that there were then upwards of one hundred and fifty inRome, and that many persons were proscribed through thedevices of others who were desirous to gain possession thereof.Well may our Annals be put to the blush for having to imputethose civil wars to the existence of such vices as these!</p><p>Our own age, however, has waxed even stronger in thisrespect. In the reign of Claudius, his slave Drusillanus,surnamed Rotundus, who acted as his steward<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> in NearerSpain, possessed a silver charger weighing five hundredpounds, for the manufacture of which a workshop had had to beexpressly built. This charger was accompanied also by eightother dishes, each two hundred and fifty pounds in weight.How many of his fellow-slaves,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> pray, would it have taken tointroduce these dishes, or who<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> were to be the guests servedtherefrom?<pb n="6135" /></p><p>Cornelius Nepos says that before the victory gained<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> bySylla, there were but two banquetting couches adorned withsilver at Rome, and that in his own recollection, silver wasfirst used for adorning sideboards. Fenestella, who died at theend of the reign of Tiberius Cæsar, informs us that at thatperiod sideboards, inlaid even with tortoiseshell,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> had comeinto fashion; whereas, a little before his time, they had beenmade of solid wood, of a round shape, and not much largerthan our tables. He says, however, that when he was quitea boy, they had begun to make the sideboards square, and ofdifferent<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> pieces of wood, or else veneered with maple orcitrus:<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> and that at a later period the fashion was introducedof overlaying the corners and the seams at the joinings withsilver. The name given to them in his youth, he says, was"tympana;"<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> and it was at this period, too, that the chargerswhich had been known as "magides" by the ancients, firstreceived the name of "lances," from their resemblance<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> to thescales of a balance.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Lances."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Dispensator."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Conservi"—said in keen irony.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Giants, at least, one would think.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Over the party of Marius.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. ix. c. 13.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Compacta;" probably meaning inlaid like Mosaic.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xiii. c. 29, B. xv. c. 7, and B. xvi. cc. 26, 27, 84.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Meaning, "drum sideboards," or "tambour sideboards," their shape,probably, being like that of our dumb waiters.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The name given to which was "lanx," plural "lances."</p></body>
