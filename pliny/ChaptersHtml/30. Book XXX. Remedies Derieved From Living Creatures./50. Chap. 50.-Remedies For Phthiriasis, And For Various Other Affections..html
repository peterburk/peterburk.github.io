It is asserted, too, that if the ashes, ofa burnt weasel are mixed with the cramming for chickens oryoung pigeons, they will be safe from the attacks of weasels.Beasts of burden, when troubled with pains in staling, findimmediate relief, if a bat is attached to the body; and they areeffectually cured of bots by passing a ring-dove three timesround their generative parts—a truly marvellous thing to relate,the ring-dove, on being set at liberty, dies, and the beast is in-stantly relieved from pain.</p></div2></body>
