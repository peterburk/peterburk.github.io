<div2 type="chapter" n="24" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 24.ÑGOURDS.</head><p>Gourds resemble the cucumber in nature, at least in theirmanner of growing; they manifest an equal aversion to thewinter, too, while they require constant watering and manure.<pb n="4159" />Both cucumbers and gourds are sown in holes a foot anda half<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> deep, between the vernal equinox and the summer solstice, at the time of the Parilia<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> more particularly. Some persons, however, think it better to sow gourds after the calendsof March,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and cucumbers after the nones,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and at the time ofthe Quinquatria.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> The cucumber and the gourd climb upwards in a precisely similar manner, their shoots creeping alongthe rough surface of the walls, even to the very roof, so greatis their fondness for elevated spots. They have not sufficientstrength, however, to support themselves without the aid ofstays. Shooting upwards with the greatest rapidity, they sooncover with their light shade the arched roofs of the houses andthe trellises on which they are trained. From this circum-stance it is that we find the gourd classified into two primarykinds, the roof-gourd,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> and the common gourd, which creepsupon the ground. In the first kind, from a stalk of remarkable thinness is suspended a fruit of considerable weight andvolume, and quite immoveable by the action of the wind. Thegourd, too, as well as the cucumber, admits of being lengthenedto any extent, by the aid of osier tubes more particularly. Justafter the blossom has fallen off, the plant is introduced intothese tubes, and as it grows it can be made to assume any formthat may be wished, that of a serpent coiled up being the onethat is mostly preferred; if left at liberty to grow as it hangs,it has been known before now to attain to no less than<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> ninefeet in length.</p><p>The cucumber flowers gradually, blossom succeeding blossom; and it adapts itself perfectly well to a dry soil. It is<pb n="4160" />covered with a white down, which increases in quantity as theplant gains in size.</p><p>The gourd admits of being applied to more numerous usesthan the cucumber even: the stem is used as an article offood<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> when young, but at a later period it changes its nature,and its qualities become totally different: of late, gourds havecome to be used in baths for jugs and pitchers, but for thislong time past they have been employed as casks<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> for keepingwine. The rind is tender while the fruit is green, but still itis always scraped off when the gourd is used for food. It admits of being eaten several ways, and forms a light and wholesome aliment, and this although it is one of those fruits thatare difficult of digestion by the human stomach, and are apt toswell out those who eat of them. The seeds which lie nearestto the neck of the gourd produce fruit of remarkable<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> length,and so do those which lie at the lower extremities, though notat all comparable with the others. Those, on the other hand,which lie in the middle, produce gourds of a round shape, andthose on the sides fruit that are thick and short. The seedsare dried by being placed in the shade, and when wanted forsowing, are steeped in water first. The longer and thinner thegourd is, the more agreeable it is to the palate, and hence it isthat those which have been left to grow hanging are reckonedthe most wholesome: these, too, have fewer seeds than theothers, the hardness of which is apt to render the fruit lessagreeable for eating.</p><p>Those which are intended for keeping seed, are usually not cutbefore the winter sets in; they are then dried in the smoke,and are extensively employed for preserving<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> seeds, andfor making other articles for domestic use. There has been amethod discovered, also, of preserving the gourd for table, andthe cucumber as well, till nearly the time when the next year'scrop is ripe; this is done by putting them in brine. We areassured, too, that if put in a hole dug in a place well shaded<pb n="4161" />from the sun, with a layer of sand beneath, and dry hay andearth on the top of them, they may be kept green for a verylong time. We also find wild<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> cucumbers and gourds; and,indeed, the same is the case with pretty nearly all the gardenplants. These wild varieties, however, are only possessed ofcertain medicinal properties, and for this reason we shall deferany further mention of them till we come to the Books appropriated to that subject.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This depth would probably have the effect of retarding, or else utterlyimpeding, the growth of the plant.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See c. 44 of this Book.
