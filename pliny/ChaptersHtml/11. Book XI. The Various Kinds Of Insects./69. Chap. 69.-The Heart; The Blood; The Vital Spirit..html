It is among the fish only thatthis point is turned towards the mouth. It is asserted thatthe heart is the first among the viscera that is formed in thefœtus, then the brain, and last of all, the eyes: it is said, too,that the eyes are the first organs that die, and the heart thevery last of all. The heart also is the principal seat of the heatof the body; it is constantly palpitating, and moves as thoughit were one animal enclosed within another. It is also enve-<pb n="3065" />loped in a membrane equally supple and strong, and is protected by the bulwarks formed by the ribs and the bone ofthe breast, as being the primary source and origin of life. Itcontains within itself the primary receptacles for the spirit andthe blood, in its sinuous cavity, which in the larger animals isthreefold,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and in all twofold at least: here it is that themind<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> has its abode. From this source proceed two largeveins, which branch into the fore-part and the back of the body,and which, spreading out in a series of branches, convey thevital blood by other smaller veins over all parts of the body.This is the only one<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> among the viscera that is not affected bymaladies, nor is it subject to the ordinary penalties of humanlife; but when injured, it produces instant death. While allthe other viscera are injured, vitality may still remain in theheart.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Among all the mammiferæ and the birds, the heart has four cavities,two on each side.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Mens.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is a mistake.
