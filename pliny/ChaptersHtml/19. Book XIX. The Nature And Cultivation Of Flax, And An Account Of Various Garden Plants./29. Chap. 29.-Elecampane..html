Thereare several methods employed for modifying<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> its naturalacridity and rendering it agreeable to the palate: thus, for instance, when dried it is reduced to a fine flour, and then mixedwith some sweet liquid or other, or else it is boiled in vinegarand water, or kept in soak in it; it is also steeped in variousother ways, and then mixed with boiled<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> grape-juice, or elseincorporated with honey or raisins, or dates with plenty ofmeat on them. Other persons, again, have a method of preparing it with quinces, or else sorbs or plums, while sometimesthe flavour is varied by the addition of pepper or thyme.</p><p>This plant is particularly good for weakness of the stomach,and it has acquired a high reputation from the circumstancethat Julia<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> Augusta used to eat it daily. The seed of it isquite useless, as the plant is reproduced, like the reed, fromeyes extracted from the root. This vegetable, as well as theskirret and the parsnip, is sown both in spring and autumn, aconsiderable distance being left between the plants; indeed, forelecampane, a space of no less than three feet is required, as<pb n="4168" />it throws out its shoots to a very considerable distance.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>Skirrets, however, are best transplanted.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Inula Helenium of Linnæus. Its English name is derived fromInula campana, that under which it is so highly recommended in the precepts of the School of Health at Salerno. See also B. xx. c. 19.
