<div2 type="chapter" n="7" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 7.—PROPERTIES OF THE HUMAN SPITTLE.</head><p>But it is the fasting spittle of a human being, that is, asalready<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> stated by us, the sovereign preservative against thepoison of serpents; while, at the same time, our daily experiencemay recognize its efficacy and utility,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> in many other respects.We are in the habit of spitting,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> for instance, as a preservativefrom epilepsy, or in other words, we repel contagion thereby:<pb n="5289" />in a similar manner, too, we repel fascinations, and the evilpresages attendant upon meeting a person who is lame in theright leg. We ask pardon of the gods, by spitting in<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> thelap, for entertaining some too presumptuous hope or expectation.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> On the same principle, it is the practice in all caseswhere medicine is employed, to spit three times on the ground,and to conjure the malady as often; the object being, to aid theoperation of the remedy employed. It is usual, too, to marka boil, when it first makes its appearance, three times withfasting<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> spittle. What we are going to say is marvellous,but it may easily be tested<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> by experiment: if a person repents of a blow given to another, either by hand or with amissile, he has nothing to do but to spit at once into the palmof the hand which has inflicted the blow, and all feelings<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> ofresentment will be instantly alleviated in the person struck.This, too, is often verified in the case of a beast of burden,when brought on its haunches with blows; for upon this remedybeing adopted, the animal will immediately step out and mendits pace. Some persons, however, before making an effort, spitinto the hand in manner above stated, in order to make theblow more heavy.<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span></p><p>We may well believe, then, that lichens and leprous spotsmay be removed by a constant application of fasting spittle;that ophthalmia may be cured by anointing, as it were, theeyes every morning with fasting spittle; that carcinomatamay be effectually treated, by kneading the root of the plantknown as "apple of the earth,"<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> with human spittle; thatcrick in the neck may be got rid of by carrying fasting spittleto the right knee with the right hand, and to the left kneewith the left; and that when an insect has got into the ear, it<pb n="5290" />is quite sufficient to spit into that organ, to make it come out.Among the counter-charms too, are reckoned, the practice ofspitting into the urine the moment it is voided, of spitting intothe shoe of the right foot before putting it on, and of spittingwhile a person is passing a place in which he has incurred anykind of peril.</p><p>Marcion of Smyrna, who has written a work on the virtuesof simples, informs us that the sea scolopendra will burstasunder if spit upon; and that the same is the case with bram-ble-frogs,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> and other kinds of frogs. Opilius says that serpentswill do the same, if a person spits into their open mouth; andSalpe tells us, that when any part of the body is asleep, thenumbness may be got rid of by the person spitting into hislap, or touching the upper eyelid with his spittle. If we areready to give faith to such statements as these, we must believe also in the efficacy of the following practices: upon theentrance of a stranger, or when a person looks at an infantwhile asleep, it is usual for the nurse to spit three times uponthe ground; and this, although infants are under the especialguardianship of the god Fascinus,<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> the protector, not of infantsonly, but of generals as well, and a divinity whose worship isentrusted to the Vestal virgins, and forms part of the Romanrites. It is the image of this divinity that is attached beneaththe triumphant car of the victorious general, protecting him,like some attendant physician, against the effects of envy;<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>while, at the same time, equally salutary is the advice of thetongue, which warns him to be wise in time,<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> that so Fortune<pb n="5291" />may be prevailed upon by his prayers, not to follow, as thedestroyer of his glory, close upon his back.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. vii. c. 2.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It certainly does seem to be possessed of some efficacy for the removalof spots and stains, but for no other purpose probably.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In some parts of France, the peasants spit in the hand when in terrorof spectres at night. In our country, prize-fighters spit in the band beforebeginning the combat, and costermongers spit on their morning's handsel,or first earned money, for good luck.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"In sinum."</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See Juvenal, Sat. v. 1. 112.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ajasson remarks that the human spittle contains hydrochlorate ofsoda and potash; the remedial virtues of which, however, would be infinitely small.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A quibble, Ajasson remarks. Did Pliny ever test it himself? Hewould seem to imply it.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Levatur illico in percusso culpa."</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is still the case with pugilists, and persons requiring to use strongexertion. It is based, however, on a mere superstition, as Ajasson remarks.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Malum terram." See B. xxv. c. 54, and B. xxvi. c. 56. Littrétranslates "malum," "apple," in the former passage; but here he calls it"curse of the earth."</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Rubetas." See B. viii. c. 48, B. xi. cc. 19, 76, and 116, and B.xxv. c. 76.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This divinity was identical with Mutinus or Tutinus, and wasworshipped under the form of a phallus, the male generative organ. Asthe guardian of infants, his peculiar form is still unconsciously representedin the shape of the coral bauble with which infants are aided in cuttingtheir teeth.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hence the expression "præfiscini," "Be it said without envy," supposed to avert the effects of the envious eye, fascination, or enchantment.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Resipiscere" seems to be a preferable reading to "respicere," adoptedby Sillig. This passage is evidently in a very corrupt state; but it is mostprobable that reference is made to the attendant who stood behind thegeneral in his triumph, and reminded him that he was a man—or, accordingto Tzetzes, bade him look behind him. Pliny speaks of a servant attendingthe triumphant general, with a golden crown, in B. xxxiii. c. 4. Hardouinattempts another explanation, but a very confused and improbable one.</p></body>
