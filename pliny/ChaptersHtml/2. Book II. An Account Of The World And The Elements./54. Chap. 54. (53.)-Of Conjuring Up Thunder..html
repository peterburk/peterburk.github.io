<div2 type="chapter" n="54" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 54. (53.)—OF CONJURING UP THUNDER.</head><p>It is related in our Annals, that by certain sacred ritesand imprecations, thunder-storms may be compelled or invoked<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>. There is an old report in Etruria, that thunder wasinvoked when the city of Volsinium had its territory laidwaste by a monster named Volta<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>. Thunder was also in-<pb n="1084" />voked by King Porsenna. And L. Piso<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>, a very respectableauthor, states in the first book of his Annals, that this hadbeen frequently done before his time by Numa, and thatTullus Hostilius, imitating him, but not having properlyperformed the ceremonies, was struck with the lightning<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>.We have also groves, and altars, and sacred places, and, amongthe titles of Jupiter, as Stator, Tonans, and Feretrius, wehave a Jupiter Elicius<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>. The opinions entertained on thispoint are very various, and depend much on the dispositionsof different individuals. To believe that we can commandnature is the mark of a bold mind, nor is it less the mark ofa feeble one to reject her kindness<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>. Our knowledge hasbeen so far useful to us in the interpretation of thunder,that it enables us to predict what is to happen on a certainday, and we learn either that our fortune is to be entirelychanged, or it discloses events which are concealed from us;as is proved by an infinite number of examples, public andprivate. Wherefore let these things remain, according tothe order of nature, to some persons certain, to others doubtful, bysome approved, by others condemned. I must not,however, omit the other circumstances connected with themwhich deserve to be related.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The following conjecture is not without a degree of probability; "Exhoc multisque aliis auctorum locis, plerique conjiciunt Etruscis auguribushaud ignotam fuisse vim electricam, licet eorum arcana nunquamdivulgata sint."
