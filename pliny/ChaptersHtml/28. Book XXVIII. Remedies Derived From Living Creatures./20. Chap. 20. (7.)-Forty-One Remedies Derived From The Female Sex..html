(7.)—FORTY-ONE REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THEFEMALE SEX.</head><p>The remedies said to be derived from the bodies of females<pb n="5302" />closely approach the marvellous nature of prodigies; to saynothing of still-born infants cut up limb by limb for the mostabominable practices, expiations made with the menstrual discharge, and other devices which have been mentioned, notonly by midwives but by harlots<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> even as well! The smell of awoman's hair, burnt, will drive away serpents, and hystericalsuffocations, it is said, may be dispelled thereby. The ashesof a woman's hair, burnt in an earthen vessel, or used incombination with litharge, will cure eruptions and prurigo ofthe eyes: used in combination with honey they will removewarts and ulcers upon infants; with the addition of honey andfrankincense, they will heal wounds upon the head, and fill upall concavities left by corrosive ulcers; used with hogs' lard,they will cure inflammatory tumours and gout; and applied topically to the part affected, they will arrest erysipelas and hæmorrhage, and remove itching pimples on the body whichresemble the stings of ants.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The use of the word "prodidere" shows that treatises had beenwritten on these abominable subjects. Laïs, Elephantis, and Salpe wereprobably the "meretrices" to whom he here alludes. See c. 23, and theend of this Book.</p></body>
