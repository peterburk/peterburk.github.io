<div2 type="chapter" n="8" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 8.—EVILS ATTENDANT UPON THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE.</head><p>Cato, who wrote to this effect, died in his eighty-fifth year,in the year of the City 605; so that no one is to suppose thathe had not sufficient time to form his experience, either withreference to the duration of the republic, or the length of hisown life. Well then-are we to conclude that he has stampedwith condemnation a thing that in itself is most useful? Farfrom it, by Hercules! for he subjoins an account of the medicalprescriptions, by the aid of which he had ensured to himselfand to his wife a ripe old age; prescriptions<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> upon which we arenow about to enlarge. He asserts also that he has a book ofrecipes in his possession, by the aid of which he treats themaladies of his son, his servants, and his friends; a book fromwhich we have extracted the various prescriptions according tothe several maladies for which they are employed.</p><p>It was not the thing itself that the ancients condemned, butit was the art as then practised, and they were shocked, moreparticularly, that man should pay so dear for the enjoyment oflife. For this reason it was, they say, that the Temple of<pb n="5377" />Æsculapius, even after he was received as a divinity, was builtwithout the City, and afterwards on an island;<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> for this reason, too, it was, that when, long after the time of Cato, theGreeks were expelled from Italy, the physicians were not<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>exempted from the decree. And here I will<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> improve uponthe foresight displayed by them. Medicine is the only one ofthe arts of Greece, that, lucrative as it is, the Roman gravityhas hitherto refused to cultivate. It is but very few of ourfellow-citizens that have even attempted it, and so soon as everthey have done so, they have become deserters to the Greeksforth with.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> Nay, even more than this, if they attempt to treatof it in any other language than Greek, they are sure to loseall credit, with the most ignorant even, and those who do notunderstand a word of Greek; there being all the less confidencefelt by our people in that which so nearly concerns their welfare, if it happens to be intelligible to them. In fact, this isthe only one of all the arts, by Hercules! in which the momenta man declares<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> himself to be an adept, he is at once believed,there being at the same time no imposture, the results of whichare more fraught with peril. To all this, however, we giveno attention, so seductive is the sweet influence of the hopeentertained of his ultimate recovery by each.</p><p>And then besides, there is no law in existence wherebyto punish the ignorance of physicians, no instance before usof capital punishment inflicted. It is at the expense of ourperils that they learn, and they experimentalize by putting usto death, a physician being the only person that can kill another with sovereign impunity. Nay, even more than this, allthe blame is thrown upon the sick man only; he is accused ofdisobedience forthwith, and it is the person who is dead andgone that is put upon his trial. It is the usage at Rome forthe decuries<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> to pass examination under the censorship of the<pb n="5378" />emperor, and for inquisitions to be made at our party-walls<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>even: persons who are to sit in judgment on our monetarymatters are sent for to Gades<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> and the very Pillars of Hercules;while a question of exile is never entertained without a panelof forty-five men selected for the purpose.<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> But when it isthe judge's own life that is at stake, who are the persons thatare to hold council upon it, but those who the very next momentare about to take it!</p><p>And yet so it is, that we only meet with our deserts, noone of us feeling the least anxiety to know what is necessaryfor his own welfare. We walk<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> with the feet of other people,we see with the eyes of other people, trusting to the memory ofothers we salute one another, and it is by the aid of others thatwe live. The most precious objects of existence, and the chiefsupports<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> of life, are entirely lost to us, and we have nothingleft but our pleasures to call our own. I will not leave Catoexposed to the hatred of a profession so ambitious as this, noryet that senate which judged as he did, but at the same timeI will pursue my object without wresting to my purpose thecrimes practised by its adepts, as some might naturally expect.For what profession has there been more fruitful in poisonings,or from which there have emanated more frauds upon willsAnd then, too, what adulteries have been committed, in thevery houses of our princes even! the intrigue of Eudemus,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>for example, with Livia, the wife of Drusus Cæsar, and that ofValens with the royal lady previously mentioned.<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> Let usnot impute these evils, I say, to the art, but to the men whopractise it; for Cato, I verily believe, as little apprehended<pb n="5379" />such practices as these in the City, as he did the presence ofroyal ladies<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> there.</p><p>I will not accuse the medical art of the avarice even of itsprofessors, the rapacious bargains made with their patients whiletheir fate is trembling in the balance, the tariffs framed upontheir agonies, the monies taken as earnest for the dispatchingof patients, or the mysterious secrets of the craft. I will notmention how that cataract must be couched<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> only, in the eye,in preference to extracting it at once—practices, all of them,which have resulted in one very great advantage, by alluringhither such a multitude of adventurers; it being no moderation on their part, but the rivalry existing between suchnumbers of practitioners, that keeps their charges within moderation. It is a well-known fact that Charmis, the physician<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> already mentioned, made a bargain with a patient ofhis in the provinces, that he should have two hundred thousandsesterces for the cure; that the Emperor Claudius extortedfrom Alcon, the surgeon,<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> ten millions of sesterces by way offine; and that the same man, after being recalled from hisexile in Gaul, acquired a sum equally large in the course of afew years.</p><p>These are faults, however, which must be imputed to individuals only; and it is not my intention to waste reproofupon the dregs of the medical profession, or to call attention tothe ignorance displayed by that crew,<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> the violation of allregimen in their treatment of disease, the evasions practised inthe use of warm baths, the strict diet they imperiously prescribe, the food that is crammed into these same patients,exhausted as they are, several times a day; together with athousand other methods of showing how quick they are tochange their mind, their precepts for the regulation of thekitchen, and their recipes for the composition of unguents,it being one grand object with them to lose sight of noneof the usual incitements to sensuality. The importation offoreign merchandize, and the introduction of tariffs settled byforeigners,<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> would have been highly displeasing to our ances-<pb n="5380" />tors, I can readily imagine; but it was not these inconveniences that Cato had in view, when he spoke thus strongly incondemnation of the medical art.</p><p>"Theriace"<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> is the name given to a preparation devised byluxury; a composition formed of six hundred<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> different ingredients; and this while Nature has bestowed upon us suchnumbers of remedies, each of which would have fully answeredthe purpose employed by itself! The Mithridatic<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span> antidoteis composed of four and fifty ingredients, none of which areused in exactly the same proportion, and the quantity prescribed is in some cases so small as the sixtieth part of onedenarius! Which of the gods, pray, can have instructed manin such trickery as this, a height to which the mere subtletyof human invention could surely never have reached? Itclearly must emanate from a vain ostentation of scientific skill,and must be set down as a monstrous system of puffing off themedical art.</p><p>And yet, after all, the physicians themselves do not understand this branch of their profession; and I have ascertainedthat it is a common thing for them to put mineral vermilion<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span>in their medicines, a rank poison, as I shall have occasion<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span> toshow when I come to speak of the pigments, in place of Indiancinnabar, and all because they mistake the name of the onedrug for that of the other! These, however, are errors whichonly concern the health of individuals, while it is the practiceswhich Cato foresaw and dreaded, less dangerous in themselvesand little regarded, practices, in fact, which the leading menin the art do not hesitate to avow, that have wrought<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span> thecorruption of the manners of our empire.</p><p>The practices I allude to are those to which, while enjoyingrobust health, we submit: such, for instance, as rubbing the bodywith wax and oil,<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span> a preparation for a wrestling match, byrights, but which, these men pretend, was invented as a preservative of health; the use of hot baths, which are necessary,<pb n="5381" />they have persuaded us, for the proper digestion of the food,baths which no one ever leaves without being all the weakerfor it, and from which the more submissive of their patientsare only carried to the tomb; potions taken fasting; vomits toclear the stomach, and then a series of fresh drenchings withdrink; emasculation, self-inflicted by the use of pitch-plastersas depilatories; the public exposure, too, of even the most delicate parts of the female body for the prosecution of thesepractices. Most assuredly so it is, the contagion which hasseized upon the public morals, has had no more fertile sourcethan the medical art, and it continues, day by day even, tojustify the claims of Cato to be considered a prophet and anoracle of wisdom, in that assertion of his, that it is quite sufficient to dip into the records of Greek genius, without becomingthoroughly acquainted with them.</p><p>Such then is what may be said in justification of the senateand of the Roman people, during that period of six hundredyears in which they manifested such repugnance to an art, bythe most insidious terms of which, good men are made to lendtheir credit and authority to the very worst, and so stronglyentered their protest against the silly persuasions entertained bythose, who fancy that nothing can benefit them but what iscoupled with high price.</p><p>I entertain no doubt, too, that there will be found some to express their disgust at the particulars which I am about to give, inrelation to animals: and yet Virgil himself has not disdained—when, too, there was no necessity for his doing so-to speakof ants and weevils,"And nests by beetles made that shun the light."<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span>Homer,<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span> too, amid his description of the battles of the gods,has not disdained to remark upon the voracity of the commonfly; nor has Nature, she who engendered man, thought it beneathher to engender these insects as well. Let each then make ithis care, not so much to regard the thing itself, as to rightlyappreciate in each case the cause and its effects.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Marked by their supereminent absurdity, as Fée remarks.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Formed by the river Tiber.
