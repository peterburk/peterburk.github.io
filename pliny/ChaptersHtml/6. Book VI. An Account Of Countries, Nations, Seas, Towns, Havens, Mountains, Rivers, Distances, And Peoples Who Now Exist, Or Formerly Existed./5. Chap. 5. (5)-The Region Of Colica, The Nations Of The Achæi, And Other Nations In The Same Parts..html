<div2 type="chapter" n="5" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 5. (5)—THE REGION OF COLICA, THE NATIONS OF THE ACHÆI, AND OTHER NATIONS IN THE SAME PARTS.</head><p>Below this lies the region of Pontus known as Colica,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> in<pb n="2012" />which the mountain chain of Caucasus bends away towards theRiphæan mountains, as we have previously<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> mentioned; oneside running down towards the Euxine and the Lake Mæotis,the other towards the Caspian and the Hyrcanian sea. Theremaining portion of these shores is peopled by savage nations,the Melanchlæni,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and the Coraxi, who formerly dwelt in Dios-curias,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> near the river Anthemus, now deserted, but once afamous city; so much so, indeed, that we learn from Timos-thenes, that three hundred nations, all of different languages,were in the habit of resorting to it, and in later times we hadthere one hundred and thirty interpreters for the purpose oftransacting business. There are some authors who are ofopinion that this place was built by Amphitus and Telchius,the charioteers<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> of Castor and Pollux, from whom it is generally understood that the nation of the Heniochi sprang. Afterpassing Dioscurias we come to the town of Heracleium,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>seventy miles distant from Sebastopolis, and then the Achæi,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>the Mardi,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> and the Cercetæ,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> and, behind them, the Cerri andthe Cephalotomi.<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> In the innermost part<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> of this districtthere was Pityus,<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> a city of very considerable opulence, but<pb n="2013" />destroyed by the Heniochi: behind it are the Epageritæ, apeople of Sarmatian origin, dwelling upon the range of theCaucasus, and beyond them, the Sauromatæ. It was withthese people that Mithridates<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> took refuge in the reign of theEmperor Claudius: and from him we learn that the Thalli<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>join up to them, a people who border on the eastern side uponthe mouth<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> of the Caspian sea: he tells us also that at thereflux the channel is dry there. Upon the coast of theEuxine, near the country of the Cercetæ, is the river Icarusa,<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span>with the town and river of Hierus , distant from Heracleiumone hundred and thirty-six miles. Next to this, is the promontory of Cruni, after passing which, we find the Toretæ upona lofty ridge of mountains. The city of Sindos<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> is distantfrom Hierus sixty-seven miles and a half; after passing which,we come to the river Setheries. (6.) From thence to the entrance of the Cimmerian Bosporus the distance is eighty-eightmiles and a half.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">16 Inhabited anciently by the Coli, and constituting the northern portion of ancient Colchis.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. v. c. 27.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or nation "with the black cloaks," from some peculiarity in theirdress.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This was the great trading-place of the wild tribes in the interior;and so numerous were they, that the Greeks asserted that there were seventydifferent languages spoken in the market of Dioscurias.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Whence the appellation <hi rend="ital">Heniochi,</hi> from the Greek <foreign lang="greek">h(nioxo\s.</foreign></p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There were two places called Heracleium on this coast, one north and the other south of the river Achæus: probably the latter is here meant.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably meaning the "martial people," or the "people of Mars."</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Said to have been descended from the Achæns or Greeks who accompanied Jason in the Argonautic Expedition, or, according to Ammianus, who resorted thither after the conclusion of the Trojan war.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This was the title, not of a single nation, but of a number of peoples distinguished for their predatory habits.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This people occupied the N.E. shore of the Euxine, between the Cimmerian Bosporus and the frontier of Colchis.

Parisot conjectures that this place was one of the ancient settlements of the Zigeunes, the modern Bohemians or Gypsies. He seems to found his opinion upon some observations of Malte Brun <hi rend="ital">(Précis de Geographie,</hi> vol. vi.) upon the origin of the Gypsy race, which will amply repay the perusal.</p></body>
