For contractions of the sinews, theflesh of ring-doves is very good, dried and taken with the food:and for spasmodic affections, the ashes of a hedge-hog or weaselare used. A serpent's slough, attached to the patient's body ina piece of bull's hide, is a preventive of spasms: and the driedliver of a kite, taken in doses of three oboli, in three cyathiof hydromel, is a preservative against opisthotony.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xii. c. 51.</p></body>
