(26.)ÑTREATMENT OF THE DISEASES OF TREES.</head><p>Having set forth the various maladies by which trees are attacked, it seems only proper to mention the most appropriate<pb n="3528" />remedies as well. Some of these remedies may be applied toall kinds of trees in common, while others, again, are peculiarto some only. The methods that are common to them all, are,baring the roots, or moulding them up, thus admitting the airor keeping it away, as the case may be; giving them water, ordepriving them of it, refreshing them with the nutritious juicesof manure, and lightening them of their burdens by pruning.The operation, too, of bleeding,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> as it were, is performed uponthem by withdrawing their juices, and the bark is scraped allround<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> to improve them. In the vine, the stock branches aresometimes lengthened out, and at other times repressed; thebuds too are smoothed, and in a measure polished up, in casethe cold weather has made them rough and scaly. These remedies are better suited to some kinds of trees and less so toothers: thus the cypress, for instance, has a dislike to water,and manifests an aversion to manure, spading round it, pruning,and, indeed, remedial operations of every kind; nay, what ismore, it is killed by irrigation, while, on the other hand, thevine and the pomegranate receive their principal nutrimentfrom it. In the fig, again, the tree is nourished by watering,while the very same thing will make the fruit pine and die:the almond, too, if the ground is spaded about it, will lose itsblossom. In the same way, too, there must be no diggingabout the roots of trees when newly grafted, or indeed untilsuch time as they are sufficiently strong to bear. Manytrees require that all superfluous burdens should be prunedaway from them, just as we ourselves cut the nails and hair.Old trees are often cut down to the ground, and then shoot upagain from one of the suckers; this, however, is not the casewith all of them, but only those, the nature of which, as wehave already stated,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> will admit of it.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See c. 43 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See c. 45 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. xvi. cc. 53, 56, 66, 67, and 90.</p></body>
