<div2 type="chapter" n="52" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 52.ÑALUMEN, AND THE SEVERAL VARIETIES OF IT;THIRTY-EIGHT REMEDIES.</head><p>Not less important, or indeed very dissimilar, are the uses<pb n="6295" />that are made of alumen;<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> by which name is understood asort of brine<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> which exudes from the earth. Of this, too,there are several kinds. In Cyprus there is a white alumen,and another kind of a darker colour. The difference, however,in their colour is but trifling in reality, though the uses madeof them are very dissimilar; the white liquid alumen beingemployed for dyeing<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> wool of bright colours, and the black,on the other hand, for giving wool a tawny or a sombre tint.Gold, too, is purified<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> by the agency of black alumen. Everykind of alumen is a compound of slime and water, or in otherwords, is a liquid product exuding from the earth; the concretionof it commencing in winter, and being completed by theaction of the summer sun. That portion of it which is thefirst matured, is the whitest in appearance.</p><p>The countries which produce this substance, are Spain,®gypt, Armenia, Macedonia, Pontus, Africa,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> and the islandsof Sardinia, Melos, Lipara, and Strongyle:<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> the most esteemed,however, is that of Egypt,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> the next best being theproduce of Melos. Of this last kind there are also twovarieties, the liquid alumen, and the solid. Liquid alumen,to be good, should be of a limpid, milky, appearance: whenrubbed between the fingers it should be free from grit, andproductive of a slight sensation of heat. The name given to itis "phorimon."<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> The mode of detecting whether or not it hasbeen adulterated, is by the application of pomegranate-juice;for if genuine, it will turn black on combining with thejuice. The other, or solid alumen, is pale and rough in ap-<pb n="6296" />pearance, and turns black on the application of nut-galls; forwhich reason it is known by the name of "paraphoron."<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span></p><p>Liquid alumen is naturally astringent, indurative, and corrosive:used in combination with honey, it heals ulcerations ofthe mouth, pimples, and pruriginous eruptions. The remedy,when thus used, is employed in the bath, the proportionsbeing two parts of honey to one of alumen. It has the effect,also, of checking and dispersing perspiration, and of neutralizingoffensive odours of the arm-pits. It is taken too, inthe form of pills, for affections of the spleen, and for the purposeof carrying off blood by the urine: incorporated with nitreand melanthium,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> it is curative of itch-scab.</p><p>There is one kind of solid alumen, known to the Greeks as"schiston,"<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> which splits into filaments of a whitish colour;for which reason some have preferred giving it the name of"trichitis."<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> It is produced from the mineral ore known tous as "chalcitis,"<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> from which copper is also produced, itbeing a sort of exudation from that mineral, coagulated intothe form of scum. This kind of alumen is less desiccativethan the others, and is not so useful as a check upon badhumours of the body. Used, however, either in the form of aliniment or of an injection, it is highly beneficial to the ears;as also for ulcerations of the mouth, and for tooth-ache, ifretained with the saliva in the mouth. It is employed alsoas a serviceable ingredient in compositions for the eyes, andfor the generative organs in either sex. The mode of preparingit is to roast it in crucibles, until it has quite lost itsliquid form.</p><p>There is another variety of alumen also, of a less active nature,and known as "strongyle;"<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> which is again subdividedinto two kinds; the fungous, which easily dissolves in anyliquid, and is looked upon as altogether worthless; and theporous, which is full of small holes like a sponge, and inpieces of a globular form, more nearly approaching whitealumen in appearance. It has a certain degree, too, of unctuousness,is free from grit, friable, and not apt to blacken the<pb n="6297" />fingers. This last kind is calcined by itself upon hot coals,unmixed with any other substance, until it is entirely reducedto ashes.</p><p>The best kind of all, however, is that called "melinum,"<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>as coming from the Isle of Melos, as already mentioned; nonebeing more effectual for acting as an astringent, stainingblack, and indurating, and none assuming a closer consistency.It removes granulations of the eye-lids, and, in a calcined state,is still more efficacious for checking defluxions of the eyes:in this last form, too, it is employed for the cure of pruriginouseruptions on the body. Whether taken internally, oremployed externally, it arrests discharges of blood; and if it isapplied with vinegar to a part from which the hair has beenfirst removed, it will change into a soft down the hair whichreplaces it. The leading property of every kind of alumen isits remarkable astringency, to which, in fact, it is indebted forits name<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> with the Greeks. It is for this property that thevarious kinds are, all of them, so remarkably good for theeyes. In combination with grease, they arrest discharges ofblood; and they are employed in a similar manner for checkingthe spread of putrid ulcers, and for removing sores uponthe bodies of infants.</p><p>Alumen has a desiccative effect upon dropsical eruptions;and, in combination with pomegranate juice, it removes diseasesof the ears, malformed nails, indurations resulting fromcicatrization, hangnails, and chilblains. Calcined, with vinegaror nut-galls, in equal proportions, it is curative of phaged¾niculcers; and, in combination with extracted juice ofcabbage, of leprosy. Used in the proportion of one part ofalumen to two of salt, it arrests the progress of serpiginouseruptions; and an infusion of it in water destroys lice andother parasitical insects that infest the hair. Employed in asimilar manner, it is good for burns; and, in combination withthe serous<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> part of pitch, for furfuraceous eruptions on thebody. It is used also as an injection for dysentery, and, employedin the form of a gargle, it braces the uvula and tonsillaryglands. For all those maladies which we have men-<pb n="6298" />tioned as being treated with the other kinds of alumen, thatimported from Melos, be it understood, is still more efficacious.As to the other uses that are made of it for industrial purposes,such as preparing hides and wool, for example, theyhave been mentioned already.<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Beckmann is of opinion that our <hi rend="ital">alum</hi> was not known to the Greeksor Romans, and that what the latter called "alumen" was green vitriol,or sulphate of the protoxide of iron, in an impure state. Hist. Inv. Vol. I.p. 180. <hi rend="ital">Bohn's Edition.</hi> Dr. Pereira remarks, however, that "therecan be little doubt that Pliny was acquainted with our alum, but did notdistinguish it from sulphate of iron, for he informs us that one kind ofalum was white, and was used for dyeing wool of bright colours." MateriaMedica, Vol. I. Delafosse identifies the "alumen" of Pliny with doublesulphate of alum and iron.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Salsugo terr¾."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See Note 11 above.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">For gilding, Hardouin says.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Roman provinces in Africa, other than Egypt.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Strombolo.
