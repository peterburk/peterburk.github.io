It is practised<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> with water, for instance, withballs, by the aid of the air, of the stars, of lamps, basins, hatchets,and numerous other appliances; means by which it engagesto grant a foreknowledge of things to come, as well as conversewith ghosts and spirits of the dead. All these practices, however, have been proved by the Emperor Nero, in our own day,to be so many false and chim¾rical illusions; entertaining ashe did a passion for the magic art, unsurpassed even by hisenthusiastic love for the music of the lyre, and for the songs oftragedy; so strangely did his elevation to the highest pointof human fortune act upon the deep-seated vices of his mind!It was his leading desire to command the gods of heaven, andno aspiration could he conceive more noble than this. Neverdid person lavish more favours upon any one of the arts; andfor the attainment of this, his favourite object, nothing waswanting to him, neither riches, nor power, nor aptitude atlearning, and what not besides, at the expense of a sufferingworld.</p><p>It is a boundless, an indubitable proof, I say, of the utterfalsity of this art, that such a man as Nero abandoned it; andwould to heaven that he had consulted the shades below, andany other spirits as well, in order to be certified in his suspicions, rather than commissioned the denizens of stews andbrothels to make those inquisitions of his [with reference tothe objects of his jealousy]. For assuredly there can be no<pb n="5428" />superstition, however barbarous and ferocious the rites whichit sanctions, that is not more tolerant than the imaginationswhich he conceived, and owing to which, by a series of bloodstained crimes, our abodes were peopled with ghosts.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">These kinds of divination, rather than magic, were called hydromancy,sph¾romancy, a‘romancy, astromancy, lychnomancy, lecanomancy, andaxinomancy. See Rabelais, B. iii. c. 25, where a very full account is givenof the Magic Art, as practised by the ancients. Coffee-grounds, glair ofeggs, and rose-leaves, are still used in France for purposes of divinationby the superstitious.</p></body>
