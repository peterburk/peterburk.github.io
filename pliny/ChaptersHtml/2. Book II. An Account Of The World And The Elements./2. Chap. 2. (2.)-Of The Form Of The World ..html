<div2 type="chapter" n="2" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 2. (2.)—OF THE FORM OF THE WORLD<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>.</head><p>That it has the form of a perfect globe we learn fromthe name which has been uniformly given to it, as well asfrom numerous natural arguments. For not only does afigure of this kind return everywhere into itself<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and sustainitself, also including itself, requiring no adjustments, notsensible of either end or beginning in any of its parts, and isbest fitted for that motion, with which, as will appear hereafter, itis continually turning round; but still more, becausewe perceive it, by the evidence of the sight, to be, in everypart, convex and central, which could not be the case wereit of any other figure.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">I may remark, that the astronomy of our author is, for the mostpart, derived from Aristotle; the few points in which they differ will bestated in the appropriate places.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This doctrine was maintained by Plato in his Timæus, p. 310, andadopted by Aristotle, De Cœlo, lib. ii. cap. 14, and by <placeName key="tgn,2031372" authname="tgn,2031372">Cicero</placeName>, De Nat.Deor. ii 47. The spherical form of the world, <foreign lang="greek">ou)rano\s,</foreign> and its circularmotion are insisted upon by Ptolemy, in the commencement of hisastronomical treatise <foreign lang="greek">Mega/lh Su/ntacis,</foreign> Magna Constructio, frequently referredto by its Arabic title Almagestum, cap. 2. He issupposed to havemade his observations at <placeName key="tgn,2099733" authname="tgn,2099733">Alexandria</placeName>, between the years 125 and 140 A.D.His great astronomical work was translated into Arabic in the year <date value="827" authname="827">827</date>;the original Greek text was first printed in <date value="1538" authname="1538">1538</date> by Grynæus, with acommentary by <placeName key="tgn,2108019" authname="tgn,2108019">Theon</placeName>. George of Trebisond published a Latin versionof it in <date value="1541" authname="1541">1541</date>, and a second was published by Camerarius in <date value="1551" authname="1551">1551</date>, alongwith Ptolemy's other works. John Muller, usually called Regiomontanus,and Purback published an abridgement of the Almagest in <date value="1541" authname="1541">1541</date>. For anaccount of Ptolemy I may refer to the article in the Biog. Univ. xxxv.263 <hi rend="ital">et seq.,</hi> by Delambre, also to Hutton's Math. Diet., <hi rend="ital">inloco,</hi> and tothe high character of him by Whewell, Hist. of the Inductive Sciences,p. 214.</p></body>
