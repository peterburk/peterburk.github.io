That of Hammoniumis the most esteemed, and that of Egypt next, after whichcomes the Syrian tree. It is only odoriferous, however, inplaces that are destitute of water. The tears of it are of anunctuous nature, and are employed as an ingredient in unguents, to modify the harshness of the oil.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is generally supposed by the commentators, that Pliny makes amistake here, and that the elate or spathe was not a tree, but the envelopeor capsule, containing the flowers and fruit of a tree, which is supposed bysome to have been really the Phœnix dactylifera, or date-palm. Therecan be little doubt that he is mistaken in his mention of the abies or fir-tree here. See B. xxiii. c. 53.</p></body>
