AT WHAT SEASONSTHEY ARE NOT INAUSPICIOUS.</head><p>Crows, again, have another kind of food. Nuts being toohard for their beak to break, the crow flies to a great height,<pb n="2491" />and then lets them fall again and again upon the stones or tilesbeneath, until at last the shell is cracked, after which the birdis able to open them. This is a bird with a very ill-omenedgarrulity, though it has been highly praised by some.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> It isobserved, that from the rising of the constellation Arcturusuntil the arrival of the swallow, it is but rarely to be seenabout the sacred groves and temples of Minerva; in someplaces, indeed, not at all, Athens for instance.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> In addition tothese facts, it is the only one that continues to feed its youngfor some time after they have begun to fly. The crow is mostinauspicious at the time of incubation, or, in other words, justafter the summer solstice.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Curse on your ill—Betiding croak."
