SANDARESOS.</head><p>Of a kindred nature, too, is sandastros,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> known as "garamantites"by some: it is found in India, at a place of thatname, and is a product also of the southern parts of Arabia.The great recommendation of it is, that it has all the appearanceof fire placed behind a transparent substance, it burning withstar-like scintillations within, that resemble drops of gold, and<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span><pb n="6424" />are always to be seen in the body of the stone, and never uponthe surface. There are certain religious associations, too, connectedwith this stone, in consequence of the affinity which itis supposed to bear with the stars; these scintillations beingmostly, in number and arrangement, like the constellations ofthe Pleiades and Hyades; a circumstance which had led to theuse of it by the Chaldæi in the ceremonials which they practise.</p><p>Here, too, the male stones are distinguished from the female,by their comparative depth of colour and the vigorousness ofthe tints which they impart to objects near them: indeed thestones of India, it is said, quite dim the sight by their brilliancy.The flame of the female sandastros is of a more softened nature,and may be pronounced to be lustrous rather than brilliant.Some prefer the stone of Arabia to that of India, and say thatthis last bears a considerable resemblance to a smoke-colouredchrysolithos. Ismenias asserts that sandastros, in consequenceof its extreme softness, will not admit of being polished, acircumstance which makes it sell all<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> the dearer: other writers,again, call these stones "sandrisitæ." One point upon whichall the authorities are agreed is, that the greater the numberof stars upon the stone, the more costly it is in price.</p><p>The similarity of the name has sometimes caused this stone to beconfounded with that known as "sandaresos," and which Nicandercalls "sandaserion," and others "sandaseron." Some, again,call this last-mentioned stone "sandastros," and the former one"sandaresos." The stone<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> that is thus mentioned by Nicander,is a native of India as well as the other, and likewise takesits name from the locality where it is found. The colour ofit is that of an apple, or of green oil, and no one sets anyvalue on it.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Sandaresus" and "Sandasiros" are other readings.
