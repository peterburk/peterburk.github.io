<div2 type="chapter" n="17" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 17.—THE IMMODERATE PRICES OF STATUES.</head><p>In the ædileship of M. Scaurus, there were three thousandstatues erected on the stage of what was a temporary theatre<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>only. Mummius, the conqueror of Achaia, filled the Citywith statues; he who at his death was destined not to leave adowry to his daughter,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> for why not mention this as anapology for him? The Luculli<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> also introduced many articlesfrom abroad. Yet we learn from Mucianus,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> who wasthrice consul, that there are still three thousand statues inRhodes, and it is supposed that there are no fewer in existenceat Athens, at Olympia, and at Delphi. What livingmortal could enumerate them all? or of what utility wouldbe such information? Still, however, I may, perhaps, affordamusement by giving some slight account of such of those worksof art as are in any way remarkable, and stating the names ofthe more celebrated artists. Of each of these it would beimpossible to enumerate all the productions, for Lysippus<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>alone is said to have executed no less than fifteen hundred<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>works of art, all of which were of such excellence that anyone of them might have immortalized him. The number wasascertained by his heir, upon opening his coffers after hisdeath, it having been his practice to lay up one golden<pb n="6164" />denarius<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> out of the sum which he had received as the priceof each statue.</p><p>This art has arrived at incredible perfection, both in successfulnessand in boldness of design. As a proof of successfulness,I will adduce one example, and that of a figure whichrepresented neither god nor man. We have seen in our owntime, in the Capitol, before it was last burnt by the party<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> ofVitellius, in the shrine of Juno there, a bronze figure of a doglicking its wounds. Its miraculous excellence and its perfecttruthfulness were not only proved by the circumstance of itshaving been consecrated there, but also by the novel kind ofsecurity that was taken for its safety; for, no sum appearingequal to its value, it was publicly enacted that the keepers ofit should be answerable for its safety with their lives.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxxvi. c.
