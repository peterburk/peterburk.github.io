<div2 type="chapter" n="14" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 14. (7.)—THE PEPPER-TREE.—THE VARIOUS KINDS OFPEPPER—BREGMA—ZINGIBERI, OR ZIMPIBERI.</head><p>The olive-tree<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> of India is unproductive, with the soleexception of the wild olive. In every part we meet with treesthat bear pepper,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> very similar in appearance to our junipers,<pb n="3112" />although, indeed, it has been alleged by some authors that theyonly grow on the slopes of Caucasus which lie exposed to thesun. The seeds, however, differ from those of the juniper, inbeing enclosed in small pods similar to those which we see inthe kidney-bean. These pods are picked before they open,and when dried in the sun, make what we call "long pepper."But if allowed to ripen, they will open gradually, and whenarrived at maturity, discover the white pepper; if left exposed to the heat of the sun, this becomes wrinkled, and changesits colour. Even these productions, however, are subject totheir own peculiar infirmities, and are apt to become blastedby the inclemency of the weather; in which case the seedsare found to be rotten, and mere husks. These abortive seeds areknown by the name of "bregma," a word which in the Indianlanguage signifies "dead." Of all the various kinds of pepper,this is the most pungent, as well as the very lightest, and isremarkable for the extreme paleness of its colour. That whichis black is of a more agreeable flavour; but the white pepperis of a milder quality than either.</p><p>The root of this tree is not, as many persons have imagined,the same as the substance known as zimpiberi, or, as some callit, zingiberi, or ginger, although it is very like it in taste.For ginger, in fact, grows in Arabia and in Troglodytica, invarious cultivated spots, being a small plant<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> with a whiteroot. This plant is apt to decay very speedily, although it isof intense pungency; the price at which it sells is six denariiper pound. Long pepper is very easily adulterated withAlexandrian mustard; its price is fifteen denarii per pound,while that of white pepper is seven, and of black, four. It isquite surprising that the use of pepper has come so much intofashion, seeing that in other substances which we use, it issometimes their sweetness, and sometimes their appearance thathas attracted our notice; whereas, pepper has nothing in itthat can plead as a recommendation to either fruit or berry, itsonly desirable quality being a certain pungency; and yet it isfor this that we import it all the way from India! Who wasthe first to make trial of it as an article of food? and who, Iwonder, was the man that was not content to prepare himself<pb n="3113" />by hunger only for the satisfying of a greedy appetite? Bothpepper and ginger grow wild in their respective countries, andyet here we buy them by weight—just as if they were somuch gold or silver. Italy,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> too, now possesses a species ofpepper-tree, somewhat larger than the myrtle, and not veryunlike it. The bitterness of the grains is similar to that whichwe may reasonably suppose to exist in the Indian pepperwhen newly gathered; but it is wanting in that mature flavour which the Indian grain acquires by exposure in the sun,and, consequently, bears no resemblance to it, either in colouror the wrinkled appearance of the seeds. Pepper is adulteratedwith juniper berries, which have the property, to a marvellousdegree, of assuming the pungency of pepper. In reference toits weight, there are also several methods of adulterating it.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Fée expresses himself at a loss to conjecture what trees are here meantby Pliny.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Fée remarks, that there are many inaccuracies in the account heregiven by Pliny of the pepper-tree, and that it does not bear any resem-blance to the juniper-tree. The grains, he says, grow in clusters, and notin a husk or pod; and he remarks, that the long pepper and the black pepper, of which the white is only a variety divested of the outer coat, aredistinct species. He also observes, that the real long pepper, the Piperlongum of Linnæus, was not known to the ancients.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Fée remarks, that this is not a correct description of ginger, the Amomum zingiber of Linnæus. Dioscorides was one of those who thoughtthat ginger was the root of the pepper-tree.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is very doubtful what tree is here alluded to by Pliny, though certain that it is not one of the pepper-trees. Sprengel takes it to be theDaphne Thymelæa.</p></body>
