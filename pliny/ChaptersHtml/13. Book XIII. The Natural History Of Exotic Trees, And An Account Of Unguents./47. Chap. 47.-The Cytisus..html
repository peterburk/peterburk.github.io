<div2 type="chapter" n="47" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 47.ÑTHE CYTISUS.</head><p>The cytisus<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> is also a shrub, which, as a food for sheep; hasbeen extolled with wonderful encomiums by Aristomachus theAthenian, and, in a dry state, for swine as well: the sameauthor, too, pledges his word that a jugerum of very middling land, planted with the cytisus, will produce an incomeof two thousand sesterces per annum. It is quite as useful asthe ervum,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> but is apt to satiate more speedily: very little ofit is necessary to fatten cattle; to such a degree, indeed, thatbeasts of burden, when fed upon it, will very soon take a dislike to barley. There is no fodder known, in fact, that isproductive of a greater abundance of milk, and of better quality; in the medical treatment of cattle in particular, thisshrub is found a most excellent specific for every kind of malady. Even more than this, the same author recommends it,when first dried and then boiled in water, to be given to nursing women, mixed with wine, in cases where the milk hasfailed them: and he says that, if this is done, the infant willbe all the stronger and taller for it. In a green state, or, ifdried, steeped in water, he recommends it for fowls. BothDemocritus and Aristomachus promise us also that bees willnever fail us so long as they can obtain the cytisus for food.There is no crop that we know of, of a similar nature, thatcosts a smaller price. It is sown at the same time as barley,or, at all events, in the spring, in seed like the leek, or elseplanted in the autumn, and before the winter solstice, in the stalk.When sown in grain, it ought to be steeped in water, and if<pb n="3209" />there should happen to be no rain, it ought to be wateredwhen sown: when the plants are about a cubit in height,they are replanted in trenches a foot in depth. It is transplanted at the equinoxes, while the shrub is yet tender, and inthree years it will arrive at maturity. It is cut at the vernalequinox, when the flower is just going off; a child or an oldwoman is able to do this, and their labour may be had at atrifling rate. It is of a white appearance, and if one wouldwish to express briefly what it looks like, it is a trifoliatedshrub,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> with small, narrow leaves. It is always given toanimals at intervals of a couple of days, and in winter, when it isdry, before being given to them, it is first moistened with water.Ten pounds of cytisus will suffice for a horse, and for smalleranimals in proportion: if I may here mention it by the way,it is found very profitable to sow garlic and onions betweenthe rows of cytisus.</p><p>This shrub has been found in the Isle of Cythnus, fromwhence it has been transplanted to all the Cyclades, and morerecently to the cities of Greece, a fact which has greatly increased the supply of cheese: considering which, I am muchsurprised that it is so rarely used in Italy. This shrub is proof,too, against all injuries from heat, from cold, from hail, andfrom snow: and, as Hyginus adds, against the depredations ofthe enemy even, the wood<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> produced being of no value whatever.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From the various statements of ancient authors, FŽe has come to theconclusion that this name was given to two totally different productions.The cytisus which the poets speak of as grateful to bees and goats, andsheep, he takes to be the Medicago arborea of Linn¾us, known to us asMedic trefoil, or lucerne; while the other, a tree with a black wood, heconsiders identical with the Cytisus laburnum of Linn¾us, the laburnum,or false ebony tree.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A kind of vetch or tare. See B. xviii.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Frutex." When speaking of it as a shrub, he seems to be confounding the tree with the plant.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Evidently in allusion to the tree.</p></body>
