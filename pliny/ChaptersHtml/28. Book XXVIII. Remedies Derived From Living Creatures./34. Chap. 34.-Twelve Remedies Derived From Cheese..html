<div2 type="chapter" n="34" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 34.—TWELVE REMEDIES DERIVED FROM CHEESE.</head><p>We have already<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> spoken of the different kinds of cheesewhen treating of the mamillæ and other parts of animals.Sextius attributes the same properties to mares' milk cheesethat he does to cheese made of cows' milk: to the former hegives the names of "hippace." Cheese is best for the stomach when not salted, or, in other words, when new cheese isused. Old [salted] cheese has a binding effect upon thebowels, and reduces the flesh, but is more wholesome tothe stomach [than new salted cheese]. Indeed, we may pronounce of aliments in general, that salt meats reduce the system,while fresh food has a tendency to make flesh. Fresh cheese,applied with honey, effaces the marks of bruises. It acts,also, emolliently upon the bowels; and, taken in the form oftablets, boiled in astringent wine and then toasted with honey ona platter, it modifies and alleviates griping pains in the bowels.</p><p>The cheese known as "saprum,"<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> is beaten up, in wine, withsalt and dried sorb apples, and taken in drink, for the cure ofceliac affections. Goats' milk cheese, pounded and applied tothe part affected, is a cure for carbuncle of the generative organs;sour cheese, also, with oxymel, is productive of a similar effect.In the bath it is used as a friction, alternately with oil, for theremoval of spots.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span><pb n="5323" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. xi. c. 97.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From the Greek <foreign lang="greek">sapro\n,</foreign> "rotten" cheese.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Like our cream cheese, or new milk cheese. probably.</p></body>
