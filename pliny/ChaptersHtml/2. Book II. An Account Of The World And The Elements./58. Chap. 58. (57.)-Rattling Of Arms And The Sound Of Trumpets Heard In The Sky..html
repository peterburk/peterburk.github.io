(57.)—RATTLING OF ARMS AND THE SOUND OFTRUMPETS HEARD IN THE SKY.</head><p>We have heard, that during the war with the Cimbri, therattling of arms and the sound of trumpets were heard throughthe sky, and that the same thing has frequently happenedbefore and since<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>.
