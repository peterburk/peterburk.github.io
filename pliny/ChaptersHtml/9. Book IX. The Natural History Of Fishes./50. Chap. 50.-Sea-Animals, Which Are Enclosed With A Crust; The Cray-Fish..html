Thiscreature keeps itself concealed for five months, and the same isthe case with crabs, which disappear for the same period. Atthe beginning of spring, however, they both<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> of them, after the<pb n="2424" />manner of snakes, throw off old age, and renew their coverings.While other animals swim on the water, cray-fish float with akind of action like creeping. They move onwards, if there isnothing to alarm<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> them, in a straight line, extending on eachside their horns, which are rounded at the point by a ballpeculiar to them; but, on the other hand, the moment theyare alarmed, they straighten these horns, and proceed witha sidelong motion. They also use<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> these horns when fighting with each other. The cray-fish is the only animal thathas the flesh in a pulpy state, and not firm and solid, unlessit is cooked alive in boiling water.</p><p>(31.) The cray-fish frequents rocky places, the crab<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> spotswhich present a soft surface. In winter they both choosesuch parts of the shore as are exposed to the heat of the sun,and in summer they withdraw to the shady recesses of deepinlets of the sea. All fish of this kind suffer from the cold ofwinter, but become fat during autumn and spring, and moreparticularly during the full moon; for the warmth of that luminary, as it shines in the night, renders<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> the temperature of theweather more moderate.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Locusta;" literally, the "locust" of the sea. By this name is meant,Cuvier says, the "langouste" of the French (our cray-fish), which has nolarge forcipes, and has a thorax covered with spines; the Palinurus quadricornis of the naturalists. This is clearly the <foreign lang="greek">ka/rabos</foreign> of Aristotle, Hist.Anim. B. viii. c. 23; for we generally find it thus translated by Pliny,when he borrows anything from that philosopher. We know that the bodyof this animal was spiny, from the fact that Tiberius, as we learn fromSuetonius, cruelly caused the face of a fisherman who had offended him, tobe rubbed with a locusta.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle, and Theophrastus, in his "Treatise on Animals whichconceal themselves," state to a similar effect.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle, Hist.
