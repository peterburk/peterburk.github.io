(28.)ÑINSTANCES OF EXTREME COURAGE.</head><p>A minute enquiry by whom the greatest valour has everbeen exhibited, would lead to an endless discussion, more especially if all the fables of the poets are to be taken for granted.Q. Ennius admired T. C¾cilius Denter<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and his brother to such adegree, that on their account he added a sixteenth book to hisAnnals. L. Siccius Dentatus, who was tribune of the peoplein the consulship of Spurius Tarpeius and A. Aterius,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> notlong after the expulsion of the kings, has also very numeroustestimonies in his favour. This hero fought one hundred andtwenty battles, was eight times victorious in single combat, andwas graced with forty-five wounds in the front of the body,without one on the back. The same man also carried offthirty-four spoils,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> was eighteen times presented with the victor's spear,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and received twenty-five pendants,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> eighty-three<pb n="2171" />torcs,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> one hundred and sixty bracelets,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> twenty-six crowns,(of which fourteen were civic, eight golden, three mural, andone obsidional), a fisc<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> of money, ten prisoners, and twentyoxen altogether.<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> He followed in the triumphal processionsof nine generals, who mainly owed their victories to his exertions; besides all which, a thing that I look upon as the mostimportant of all his services, he denounced to the people T.Romilius,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> one of the generals of the army, at the end of hisconsulship, and had him convicted of having made an improperuse of his authority.<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span></p><p>The military honours of Manlius Capitolinus would havebeen no less splendid than his, if they had not been all effacedat the close of his life. Before his seventeenth year, he had<pb n="2172" />gained two spoils, and was the first of equestrian rank who received a mural crown; he also gained six civic crowns, thirty seven donations, and had twenty-three scars on the fore-part ofhis body. He saved the life of P. Servilius, the master of thehorse, receiving wounds on the same occasion in the shouldersand the thigh. Besides all this, unaided, he saved the Capitol,when it was attacked by the Gauls, and through that, thestate itself; a thing that would have been the most gloriousact of all, if he had not so saved it, in order that he might, asits king, become its master.<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> But in all matters of this nature,although valour may effect much, fortune does still more.</p><p>No person living, in my opinion at least, ever excelled M.Sergius,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> although his great-grandson, Catiline, tarnished thehonours of his name. In his second campaign he lost his righthand; and in two campaigns he was wounded three and twentytimes; so much so, that he could scarcely use either his handsor his feet; still, attended by a single slave, he afterwardsserved in many campaigns, though but an invalided soldier.He was twice taken prisoner by Hannibal, (for it was with noordinary enemy that he would engage,) and twice did he escapefrom his captivity, after having been kept, without a singleday's intermission, in chains and fetters for twenty months.On four occasions he fought with his left hand alone, two horsesbeing slain under him. He had a right hand made of iron,and attached to the stump, after which he fought a battle, andraised the siege of Cremona, defended Placentia, and tooktwelve of the enemy's camps in Gaul. All this we learn froman oration of his, which he delivered when, in his pr¾torship,his colleagues attempted to exclude him from the sacred rites,on the ground of his infirmities.<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> What heaps upon heaps ofcrowns would he have piled up, if he had only had other enemies! For, in matters of this nature, it is of the first importance to consider upon what times in especial the valour of<pb n="2173" />each man has fallen. What civic crowns did Trebia, whatdid the Ticinus, what did Lake Thrasymenus afford? Whatcrown was there to be gained at Cann¾, where it was deemedthe greatest effort of valour to have escaped<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> from the enemy?Other persons have been conquerors of men, no doubt, butSergius<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> conquered even Fortune herself.<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There has been considerable difficulty in ascertaining who was theindividual here referred to; the subject is discussed at some length byHardouin, who shows that it is probable, that it was Lucius C¾cilius, whowas slain in a battle with the Gauls, A.U.C. 470, and in the consulship ofDolabella and Domitius.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The name of this consul has been the subject of much discussionamong the commentators. Livy, B. iii. c. 31, has been referred to, ascalling him Atermius; but in some of the best editions, he is named Aterius. The tribunate of Dentatus took place A.U.C. 299, fifty-five years afterthe expulsion of the kings.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">When a Roman overcame an enemy with whom he had been personally engaged, he took possession of some part of his armour and dress,which might bear testimony to the victory; this was termed the "spolium."ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Hasta pura;" these words, according to Hardouin, signify a lancewithout an iron head. We are told that it was given to him who gainedthe first victory in a battle; it was also regarded as an emblem of supremepower, and as a mark of the authority which one nation claimed overanother.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Phaleris." These were bosses, discs or crescents of metal, sometimes gold, They were mostly used in pairs, and as ornaments for thehelmet; but we more commonly read of them as attached to the harness of horses, and worn as pendants from the head, so as to produce a terrificeffect when shaken by the rapid movements of the horse.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The "torques" was an ornament of gold, twisted spirally and bentinto a circular form, and worn among the upper classes of the Persians,the Gauls, and other Asiatic and northern nations. They are often foundboth in France and Ireland, as well as in this country, but varying greatlyin size and weight.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Golden "armill¾," or bracelets, were worn by the Gauls on the armsand the legs. The Sabines also wore them on the left arm, at the time ofthe foundation of Rome.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The word "fiscus" signifies a wicker basket or pannier, probably ofpeculiar construction, in which the Romans were accustomed to keep andcarry about large sums of money. In process of time the word came tosignify a treasure or money-chest.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We have nearly the same detail of the honours bestowed on Dentatusby Val. Maximus, B. iii. c. 2. Pliny again speaks of Dentatus, and thehonours bestowed upon him, B. xxii. c. 5; and especially notices the "corona graminea," the grass or obsidional crown, as the highest of his honours. The different kinds of honorary crowns are very fully described inB. xvi. c. 3, 4, and 5; in B. xxii. c. 4, we have a particular account ofthe "corona graminea;" in c. 5, mention is made of its having been givento Dentatus, and, in the next, other individuals are enumerated to whom ithad been presented.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">T. Romilius Rocus Vaticanus was consul B.C. <date value="-455" authname="-455">455</date>. Having defeated the ®qui, and gained immense booty, instead of distributing itamong the soldiers, he and his colleague sold it, on account of the povertyof the treasury. They were, in consequence, brought to trial, and Veturiuswas sentenced to pay 10,000 asses. He was, however, elected augur in453, as some compensation for the ill-treatment he had experienced.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Livy, B. iii. c. 31, gives an account of the conviction of Romilius, butsays, that it was effected by C. Claudius Cicero, the tribune of the people.To obviate the discordance in the names, some commentators have proposed to substitute the words "Lucio Siccio" for "Claudio Cicerone."ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We have an account of the victories, honours, and unfortunate fate ofManlius in Livy, B. vi. c. 14Ñ20. In enumerating the honours conferredupon him, the numbers are given somewhat differently in c. 20; thirtyspoils of enemies slain, forty donations from the generals, two mural andeight civic crowns.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">M. Sergius Silus. He was one of the city pr¾tors B.C. <date value="-197" authname="-197">197</date>.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Among the Jews and other nations of antiquity, it was considered anessential point for the priests to be without blemish, perfect and free fromdisease.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In allusion to the compliment paid by the senate to the consul, M.Terentius Varro, by whose rashness the battle of Cann¾ was lost. On hisescape and safe return to Rome, instead of visiting him with censure,he received the thanks of the senate, "that he had not despaired of therepublic."</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It appears somewhat remarkable, considering the extraordinary actsof valour here enumerated, as performed by Sergius, that we hear so littleof him from other sources.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_17"><a href="#ref_17">17. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hardouin takes the meaning to be, that though ill fortune overtookthe Romans in their wars with Hannibal, nevertheless Sergius defeatedFortune herself, in dying before his country was overwhelmed by thosecalamities.</p></body>
