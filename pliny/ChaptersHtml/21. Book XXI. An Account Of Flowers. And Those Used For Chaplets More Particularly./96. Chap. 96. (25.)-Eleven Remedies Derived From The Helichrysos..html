<div2 type="chapter" n="96" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 96. (25.)—ELEVEN REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE HELICHRYSOS.</head><p>The helichrysos is by some persons called the "chrysanthemon.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> It has small, white branches, with leaves of awhitish colour, similar to those of the abrotonum. The clusters,disposed around it, and glistening like gold in the rays of thesun, are never known to fade; hence it is that they makechaplets of it for the gods, a custom which was most faithfullyobserved by Ptolemæus, the king of Egypt. This plant growsin shrubberies: taken in wine, it acts as a diuretic and emmenagogue, and, in combination with honey, it is employed topically for burns. It is taken also in potions for the stings ofserpents, and for pains in the loins; and, with honied wine, it<pb n="4381" />removes coagulated blood in the abdominal regions and thebladder. The leaves of it, beaten up and taken in doses ofthree oboli, in white wine, arrest the menstrual dischargewhen in excess.</p><p>The smell of this plant is far from disagreeable, and henceit is kept with clothes, to protect them from the attacks ofvermin.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See c. 38.
