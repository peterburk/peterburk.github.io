<div2 type="chapter" n="44" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 44.—THE ORIGIN OF WINDS.</head><p>In like manner I would not deny that winds, or rathersudden gusts, are produced by the arid and dry vapours ofthe earth; that air may also be exhaled from water, whichcan neither be condensed into a mist, nor compressed into acloud; that it may be also driven forward by the impulse ofthe sun, since by the term 'wind' we mean nothing more thana current of air, by whatever means it may be produced<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>.For we observe winds to proceed from rivers and bays, andfrom the sea, even when it is tranquil; while others, whichare named <hi rend="ital">Altani,</hi> rise up from the earth; when they comeback from the sea they are named <hi rend="ital">Tropæi,</hi> but if they gostraight on, <hi rend="ital">Apogæi</hi><span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>.<pb n="1071" /></p><p>(44.) The windings and the numerous peaks of mountains,their ridges, bent into angles or broken into defiles, with thehollow valleys, by their irregular forms, cleaving the air whichrebounds from them (which is also the cause why voices are,in many cases, repeated several times in succession), give riseto winds.</p><p>(45.) There are certain caves, such as that on the coast ofDalmatia, with a vast perpendicular chasm, into which, if alight weight only be let down, and although the day be calm,a squall issues from it like a whirlwind. The name of theplace is Senta. And also, in the province of Cyrenaica, thereis a certain rock, said to be sacred to the south wind, whichit is profane for a human hand to touch, as the south windimmediately rolls forwards clouds of sand<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>. There are also,in many houses, artificial cavities, formed in the walls<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, whichproduce currents of air; none of these are without theirappropriate cause.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Our author's opinion respecting the origin of winds nearly agreeswith that of Aristotle; "nihil ut aliud ventus(<foreign lang="greek">a)/nemos</foreign>) sit, nisi aër multusfluctuans et compressus, qui etiam spiritus (<foreign lang="greek">pneu=ma</foreign>) appellatur;" DeMeteor. This treatise contains a full account of the phænomena ofwinds. Seneca also remarks, "Ventus est aër fluens;" Nat. Quæst. lib. 3&amp; 5.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle informs us, that the winds termed apogæi(<foreign lang="greek">a)po/gaioi</foreign>) proceed from a marshy and moist soil; De Mundo,cap. 4. p. 605. For theorigin and meaning of the terms here applied to the winds, see theremarks of Hardouin and Alexandre, in Lemaire, i. 323.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is mentioned by Pomp. Mela.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"In domibus etiam multis manu facta inclusa opacitateconceptacula....." Some of the MSS. have <hi rend="ital">madefacta</hi> for<hi rend="ital">manu facta,</hi> andthis reading has been adopted by Lemaire; but nearly all the editors, asDalechamps, Laët, Grovonius, Poincinet and Ajasson, retain the formerword.</p></body>
