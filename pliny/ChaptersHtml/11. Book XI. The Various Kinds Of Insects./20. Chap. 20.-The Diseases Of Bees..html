The sign that they are diseased, is a kind of torpid,moping sadness: on such occasions, they are to be seen bringing out those that are sick before the hives, and placing themin the warm sun, while others, again, are providing them withfood. Those that are dead they carry away from the hive,and attend the bodies, paying their last duties, as it were, infuneral procession. If the king should happen to be carriedoff by the pestilence, the swarm remains plunged in grief andlistless inactivity; it collects no more food, and ceases to issue<pb n="3022" />forth from its abode; the only thing that it does is to gatheraround the body, and to emit a melancholy humming noise.Upon such occasions, the usual plan is to disperse the swarmand take away the body; for otherwise they would continuelistlessly gazing upon it, and so prolong their grief. Indeed,if due care is not taken to come to their aid, they will die ofhunger. It is from their cheerfulness, in fact, and theirbright and sleek appearance that we usually form an estimateas to their health.</p><p> (19) There are certain maladies, also, which affect theirproductions; when they do not fill their combs, the diseaseunder which they are labouring is known by the name of<hi rend="ital">claros,</hi><span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and if they fail to rear their young, they are sufferingfrom the effects of that known as <hi rend="ital">blapsigonia.</hi><span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The reading seems doubtful, and the meaning is probably unknown.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Injury of the young."</p></body>
