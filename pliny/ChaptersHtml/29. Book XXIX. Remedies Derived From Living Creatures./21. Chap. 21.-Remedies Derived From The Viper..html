<div2 type="chapter" n="21" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 21.—REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE VIPER.</head><p>The application of a viper's head, even if it be not the onethat has inflicted the wound, is of infinite utility as a remedy.It is highly advantageous, too, to hold the viper that inflictedthe injury on the end of a stick, over the steam of boiling<pb n="5396" />water, for it will quite undo<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> the mischief, they say. Theashes, also, of the viper, are considered very useful, employed asa liniment for the wound. According to what Nigidius tellsus, serpents are compelled, by a sort of natural instinct, toreturn to the person who has been stung by them. The peopleof Scythia split the viper's head between the ears, in order toextract a small stone,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> which it swallows in its alarm, theysay: others, again, use the head entire.</p><p>From the viper are prepared those tablets which are knownas "theriaci"<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> to the Greeks: for this purpose the animal iscut away three fingers' length from both the head and the tail,after which the intestines are removed and the livid vein adhering to the back-bone. The rest of the body is then boiledin a shallow pan, in water seasoned with dill, and the bones aretaken out, and fine wheaten flour added; after which thepreparation is made up into tablets,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> which are dried in theshade and are employed as an ingredient in numerous medicaments. I should remark, however, that this preparation, itwould appear, can only be made from the viper. Some persons, after cleansing the viper in manner above described, boildown the fat, with one sextarius of olive oil, to one half. Ofthis preparation, when needed, three drops are added to someoil, with which mixture the body is rubbed, to repel theapproach of all kinds of noxious animals.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is <hi rend="ital">perhaps</hi> the meaning of "præcanere."
