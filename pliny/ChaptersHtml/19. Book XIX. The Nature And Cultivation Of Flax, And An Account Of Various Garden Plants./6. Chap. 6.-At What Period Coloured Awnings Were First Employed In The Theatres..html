<div2 type="chapter" n="6" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 6.—AT WHAT PERIOD COLOURED AWNINGS WERE FIRST EMPLOYED IN THE THEATRES.</head><p>In more recent<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> times linens alone have been employedfor the purpose of affording shade in our theatres; Q. Catulushaving been the first who applied them to this use, onthe occasion of the dedication by him of the Capitol. At alater period, Lentulus Spinther, it is said, was the first tospread awnings of fine linen<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> over the theatre, at the celebration of the Games in honour of Apollo. After this, Cæsar,<pb n="4139" />when Dictator, covered with a linen awning the whole of theRoman Forum, as well as the Sacred Way, from his own houseas far as the ascent to the Capitol, a sight, it is said, more wonderful even than the show of gladiators which he then exhibited. At a still later period, and upon the occasion of nopublic games, Marcellus, the son of Octavia, sister of Augustus, during his ædileship, and in the eleventh consulship of hisuncle, on the * * * day before the calends of August, coveredin the Forum with awnings, his object being to consult thehealth of those assembled there for the purposes of litigation—a vast change, indeed, from the manners prevalent in thedays of Cato the Censor, who expressed a wish that theForum was paved with nothing else but sharp pointed stones.</p><p>Awnings have been lately extended, too, by the aid of ropes,over the amphitheatres of the Emperor Nero, dyed azure, likethe heavens, and bespangled all over with stars. Those whichare employed by us to cover the inner court<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> of our housesare generally red: one reason for employing them is to protectthe moss that grows there from the rays<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> of the sun. Inother respects, white fabrics of linen have always held theascendancy in public estimation. Linen, too, was highlyvalued as early as the Trojan war; for why else should it nothave figured as much in battles as it; did in shipwrecks? ThusHomer,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> we find, bears witness that there were but few amongthe warriors of those days who fought with cuirasses<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> onmade of linen; while, as for the rigging of the ships, ofwhich that writer speaks, it is generally supposed by the morelearned among the commentators, that it was made of this material; for the word "sparta,"<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> which he employs, meansnothing more than the produce of a seed.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Postea." Sillig would reject this word, as being a corruption, andnot consistent with fact, Catulus having lived before the time of Cleopatra. He suggests that the reading should be "Populo Romano ea in the-atris spectanti umbram fecere." "Linen, too, has provided a shade forthe Roman people, when viewing the spectacles of the theatre." Lucretius,B. iv l. 73, <hi rend="ital">et seq.,</hi> speaks of these awnings as being red, yellow, andiron grey.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Carbasina." Cambric.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The cavaædium is generally supposed to have been the same as the"atrium," the large inner apartment, roofed over, with the exception ofan opening in the middle, which was called the "compluvium," or "impluvium," over which the awning here mentioned was stretched. Herethe master of the house received his visitors and clients.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">White would be much preferable to red for this purpose.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Il. ii. ll. 529 and 830.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Il. viii. l. 63.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Il. ii. l. 135.
