<div2 type="chapter" n="43" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 43.ÑCASSIA.</head><p>Cassia<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> is a shrub also, which grows not far from the plainswhere cinnamon is produced, but in the mountainous localities; the branches of it are, however, considerably thicker thanthose of cinnamon. It is covered with a thin skin rather thana bark, and, contrary to what is the case with cinnamon, itis looked upon as the most valuable when the bark falls offand crumbles into small pieces. The shrub is three cubits inheight, and the colours which it assumes are threefold: whenit first shoots from the ground, for the length of a foot, it iswhite; after it has attained that height, it is red for half afoot, and beyond that it is black. This last is the part thatis held in the highest esteem, and next to it the portion thatcomes next, the white part being the least valued of all. Theycut the ends of the branches to the length of two fingers, and<pb n="3141" />then sew them in the fresh skins of cattle that have beenkilled expressly for the purpose; the object being that theskins may putrefy, and the maggots generated thereby mayeat away the woody parts, and so excavate<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> the bark; whichis so intensely bitter, that it is quite safe from their attacks.That which is the freshest is the most highly esteemed; ithas a very delicate smell, and is so extremely hot to the taste,that it may be said to burn the tongue, rather than graduallywarm the mouth. It is of a purple colour, and though ofconsiderable volume, weighs but very little in comparison; theouter coat forms into short tubes which are by no means easilybroken: this choice kind of cassia, the barbarians call by thename of lada. There is another sort, again, which is calledbalsamodes,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> because it has a smell like that of balsam, but itis bitter; for which reason it is more employed for medicinalpurposes, just as the black cassia is used for unguents. Thereis no substance known that is subject to greater variations inprice: the best qualities sell at fifty denarii per pound, others,again, at five.</p><p>(20.) To these varieties the dealers have added another,which they call daphnoides,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and give it the surname of isocinnamon;<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> the price at which it sells is three hundreddenarii per pound. It is adulterated with storax, and, inconsequence of the resemblance of the bark, with very smallsprigs of laurel. Cassia is also planted in our<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> part of theworld, and, indeed, at the extreme verge of the Empire, on thebanks of the river Rhenus, where it flourishes when plantedin the vicinity of hives of bees. It has not, however, thatscorched colour which is produced by the excessive heat of thesun; nor has it, for the same reason, a similar smell to thatwhich comes from the south.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There has been considerable doubt what plant it was that producedthe cassia of the ancients. FŽe, after diligently enquiring into the subject,inclines to think that it was the Laurus cassia of Linn¾us, the same treethat produces the cassia of the present day.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There is little doubt that all this is fabulous.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or, "smelling like balsam."</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Looking like laurel."</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Equal to cinnamon." FŽe thinks that it is a variety of the Lauruscassia.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He probably alludes to the Daphne Cnidium of Linn¾us, which, asFŽe remarks, is altogether different from the Laurus cassia, or genuinecassia.</p></body>
