<div2 type="chapter" n="3" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 3. (4.)—AFRICA.</head><p>Beyond the river Tusca begins the region of Zeugitana<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>,and that part which properly bears the name of Africa<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>.<pb n="1389" />We here find three promontories; the White Promontory<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>,the Promontory of Apoll<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, facing Sardinia, and that ofMercury<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>, opposite to Sicily. Projecting into the sea theseheadlands form two gulfs, the first of which bears the nameof "Hipponensis" from its proximity to the city calledHippo Dirutus<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>, a corruption of the Greek name Diarrhytus,which it has received from the channels made for irrigation.Adjacent to this place, but at a greater distance fromthe sea-shore, is Theudalis<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>, a town exempt from tribute.We then come to the Promontory of Apollo, and uponthe second gulf, we find Utica<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>, a place enjoying the rightsof Roman citizens, and famous for the death of Cato; theriver Bagrada<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>, the place called Castra Cornelia<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>, the co-<pb n="1390" />lony<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> of Carthage, founded upon the remains of Great Carthage<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>,the colony of Maxula<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>, the towns of Carpi<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>, Misua,and Clypea<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>, the last a free town, on the Promontory ofMercury; also Curubis, a free town<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span>, and Neapolis<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span>.</p><p>Here commences the second division<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> of Africa properlyso called. Those who inhabit Byzacium have the name ofLibyphœnices<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span>. Byzacium is the name of a district whichis 250 miles in circumference, and is remarkable for its extremefertility, as the ground returns the seed sown by thehusbandman with interest a hundred-fold<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span>. Here are the<pb n="1391" />free towns of Leptis<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span>, Adrumetum<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span>, Ruspina<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span>, and Thapsus<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span>;and then Thenæ<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span>, Macomades<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span>, Tacape<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span>, and Sabrata<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span> whichtouches on the Lesser Syrtis; to which spot, from theAmpsaga, the length of Numidia and Africa is 580 miles,and the breadth, so far as it has been ascertained, 200.That portion which we have called Africa is divided intotwo provinces, the Old and the New; these are separatedby a dyke which was made by order of the second ScipioAfricanus<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span> and the kings<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span>, and extended to Thenæ, whichtown is distant from Carthage 216 miles.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Extending from the river Tusca, or Zaina, to the northern frontiersof Byzacium. It corresponds with the Turkish province or beylik ofTunis.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He says this not only to distinguish it from Africa, considered asone-third of the globe, but also in contradistinction to the proconsularprovince of the Roman empire of the same name, which contained notonly the province of Zeugitana, but also those of Numidia, Byzacium,and Tripolis.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Candidum: now Ras-el-Abiad.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The references to this headland identify it with Cape Farina, or RasSidi Ali-al-Mekhi, and not, as some have thought, the more westerly CapeZibeeb or Ras Sidi Bou-Shoushe. Shaw however applies the name ofZibeeb to the former.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Cape Bon, or Ras-Addar.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">More properly called Hippo Diarrhytus or Zaritus, a Tyrian colony,situate on a large lake which communicated with the sea, and receivedthe waters of another lake. Its situation exposed it to frequent inundations,whence, as the Greeks used to state, the epithet <foreign lang="greek">dia/r)r(utos.</foreign> Itseems more probable however that this is the remnant of some Phœniciantitle, as the ancients were not agreed on the true form of the name,and of this uncertainty we have a further proof in the <hi rend="ital">Hippo Dirutus</hi>of our author.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is placed by Ptolemy to the south-east of Hippo, and near thesouthern extremity of Lake Sisar.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This important city stood on the north part of the CarthaginianGulf, west of the mouth of the Bagrada, and twenty-seven Roman milesN.W. of Carthage; but the site of its ruins at the modern Bou-Shater isnow inland, in consequence of the changes made by the Bagrada in thecoast-line. In the Third Punic war Utica took part with the Romansagainst Carthage, and was rewarded with the greater part of the Carthaginianterritory.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called the Mejerdah, and though of very inconsiderable size, thechief river of the Carthaginian territory. The main stream is formedby the union of two branches, the southern of which, the ancient Bagrada,is now called the Mellig, and in its upper course the Meskianah. Theother branch is called the Hamiz.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or the "Cornelian Camp." The spot where Cornelius Scipio Africa-nus the Elder first encamped, on landing in Africa, B.C. <date value="-204" authname="-204">204</date>. Cæsar describesthis spot, in his description of Curio's operations against Utica,B. C. b. ii. c. 24, 25. This spot is now called Ghellah.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This colony was first established by Caius Gracchus, who sent 6000settlers to found on the site of Carthage the new city of Junonia. TheRoman senate afterwards annulled this with the other acts ofGracchus. Under Augustus however the new city of Carthage wasfounded, which, when Strabo wrote, was as prosperous as any city inAfrica. It was made, in place of Utica, which had favoured the Pompeianparty, the seat of the proconsul of Old Africa. It stood on thepeninsula terminated by Ras-Sidi-Bou-Said, Cape Carthage or Carthagena.As Gibbon has remarked, "The place might be unknown ifsome broken arches of an aqueduct did not guide the footsteps of theinquisitive traveller."</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The original city of Carthage was called 'Carthago Magna' to distinguishit from New Carthage and Old Carthage, colonies in Spain.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Rhades, according to Marcus.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Marcus identifies it with the modern Gurtos.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">By the Greeks called 'Aspis.' It derived its Greek and Roman namesfrom its site on a hill of a shield-like shape. It was built by Agathocles,the Sicilian, B.C. <date value="-310" authname="-310">310</date>. In the first Punic war it was the landing-placeof Manlius and Regulus, whose first action was to take it, B.C. <date value="-256" authname="-256">256</date>. Itssite is still known as Kalebiah, and its ruins are peculiarly interesting.The site of Misua is occupied by Sidi-Doud, according to Shaw andD'Anville.</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Shaw informs us that an inscription found on the spot designates thisplace as a colony, not a free city or town. Its present name is Kurbah.</p><p><span id="note_17"><a href="#ref_17">17. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The present Nabal, according to D'Anville.</p><p><span id="note_18"><a href="#ref_18">18. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Zeugitana extended from the river Tusca to Horrea-Cælia, and Byzaciumfrom this last place to Thenæ.</p><p><span id="note_19"><a href="#ref_19">19. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">As sprung partly from the Phœnician immigrants, and partly fromthe native Libyans or Africans.</p><p><span id="note_20"><a href="#ref_20">20. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny says, B. xvii. c. 3, "A hundred and fifty fold." From Shawwe learn that this fertility no longer exists, the fields producing not morethan eight- or at most twelve-fold.</p><p><span id="note_21"><a href="#ref_21">21. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The modern Lempta occupies its site.</p><p><span id="note_22"><a href="#ref_22">22. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Originally a Phœnician colony, older than Carthage. It was the capital of Byzacium, and stood within the southern extremity of the Sinus Neapolitanus or Gulf of Hammamet. Trajan made it a colony, under the high-sounding name, as we gather from inscriptions, of <hi rend="ital">Colonia Concordia Ulpia Trajana Augusta Frugifera Hadrumetana,</hi> or, as set forth on coins, <hi rend="ital">Colonia Concordia Julia Hadrumetana Pia.</hi> The epithet <hi rend="ital">Frugifera</hi> refers to the fact that it was one of the chief sea-ports for the corn-producing country of Byzacium. It was destroyed by the Vandals, but restored by the Emperor Justinian under the name of Justiniana or Justinianopolis. The modern Sousa stands on its site; and but slight traces of the ancient city are to be found.</p><p><span id="note_23"><a href="#ref_23">23. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Situate in the vicinity of the modern Monastir.</p><p><span id="note_24"><a href="#ref_24">24. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Shaw discovered its ruins at the modern town of Demas.</p><p><span id="note_25"><a href="#ref_25">25. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Taineh, according to D'Anville. This place formed the boundary between the proconsular province of Africa and the territory of the Numidian king Masinissa and his descendants.</p><p><span id="note_26"><a href="#ref_26">26. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The present Mahometa, according to Marcus, El Mahres according to D'Anville.</p><p><span id="note_27"><a href="#ref_27">27. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Cabès, according to D'Anville, giving name to the Gulf of Cabès. Marcus calls it Gaps.</p><p><span id="note_28"><a href="#ref_28">28. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Tripoli Vecchio; also called Sabart according to D'Anville.</p><p><span id="note_29"><a href="#ref_29">29. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Scipio Æmilianus, the son-in-law of Æmilius Paulus.</p><p><span id="note_30"><a href="#ref_30">30. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Micipsa, the son of Masinissa, and his two legitimate brethren. Scipio having been left by Masinissa executor of his will, the sovereign power was divided by him between Micipsa and his two brethren Gulussa and Mastanabal. On this occasion also he separated Numidia from Zeugitana and Byzacium, by a long dyke drawn from Thenæ, due south, to the borders of the Great Desert, and thence in a north-westerly direction to the river Tusca.</p></body>
