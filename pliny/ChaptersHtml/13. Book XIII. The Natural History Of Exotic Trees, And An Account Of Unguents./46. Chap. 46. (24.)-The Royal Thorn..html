(24.)—THE ROYAL THORN.</head><p>We must take care, also, not to omit a peculiar shrub thatis planted at Babylon, and only upon a thorny plant there,as it will not live anywhere else, just in the same manner asthe mistletoe will live nowhere but upon trees. This shrub,however, will only grow upon a kind of thorn, which is knownas the royal thorn.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> It is a wonderful fact, but it germinatesthe very same day that it has been planted. This is done<pb n="3208" />at the rising of the Dog-star, after which it speedily takespossession of the whole tree. They use it in the preparationof wine, and it is for this purpose that it is planted. Thisthorn grows at Athens also, upon the Long Walls there.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Spina regia. Some writers have considered this to be the same withthe Centaurea solstitialis of Linnæus. .Sprengel takes it to be the Cassytafiliformis of Linnæus, a parasitical plant of India. We must conclude,however, with Fée, that both the thorn and the parasite have not hithertobeen identified.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Makron Teichos.
