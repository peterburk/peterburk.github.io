(9.)—MIRRORS.</head><p>It is generally supposed among us that it is only the veryfinest silver that admits of being laminated, and so convertedinto mirrors. Pure silver was formerly used for the purpose,but, at the present day, this too has been corrupted by thedevices of fraud. But, really, it is a very marvellous propertythat this metal has, of reflecting objects; a property which, itis generally agreed, results from the repercussion of the air,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>thrown back as it is from the metal upon the eyes. Thesame too is the action that takes place when we use a mirror.If, again, a thick plate of this metal is highly polished, and isrendered slightly concave,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> the image or object reflected isenlarged to an immense extent; so vast is the difference betweena surface receiving,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and throwing back the air. Evenmore than this-drinking-cups are now made in such amanner, as to be filled inside with numerous<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> concave facets,like so many mirrors; so that if but one person looks into theinterior, he sees reflected a whole multitude of persons.</p><p>Mirrors, too, have been invented to reflect monstrous<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>forms; those, for instance, which have been consecrated in theTemple at Smyrna. This, however, all results from the configurationgiven to the metal; and it makes all the differencewhether the surface has a concave form like the section of adrinking cup, or whether it is [convex] like a Thracian<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>buckler; whether it is depressed in the middle or elevated;whether the surface has a direction<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> transversely or obliquely;or whether it runs horizontally or vertically; thepeculiar configuration of the surface which receives the shadows,<pb n="6127" />causing them to undergo corresponding distortions: for, infact, the image is nothing else but the shadow of the objectcollected upon the bright surface of the metal.</p><p>However, to finish our description of mirrors on the present<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>occasion—the best, in the times of our ancestors, were those ofBrundisium,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> composed of a mixture of<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> stannum and copper:at a later period, however, those made of silver were preferred,Pasiteles<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> being the first who made them, in the time<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>of Pompeius Magnus. More recently,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> a notion has arisenthat the object is reflected with greater distinctness, by theapplication to the back of the mirror of a layer of gold.<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span><pb n="6128" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A very far-fetched explanation, and very wide of the mark.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Paulum propulsa."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Which he supposes a concave surface to do.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This passage is noticed by Beckmann, in his account of Mirrors;Vol. II. p. 58. <hi rend="ital">Bohn's Edition.</hi></p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Distorting the image reflected, by reason of the irregularities of thesurface.

Hardouin(qy. if not Dalechamps ?) is of opinion that mirrors, according to thenewest invention, at that period were covered behind with a plate of gold,as our mirrors are with an amalgam. But as the ancient plates of silverwere not transparent, how could the gold at the back of them produce anyeffect in regard to the image ? May not the meaning be that a thin plateof gold was placed at some distance before the mirror, in order to throwmore light upon its surface ? Whatever may have been the case, Plinyhimself seems not to have had much confidence in the invention."— Beckmann,Hist. Inv. Vol. II. p. 62.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Dr. Watson (Chemical Essays. Vol. IV. p. 246) seems to think thatPliny is here speaking of <hi rend="ital">glass </hi> mirrors: "If we admit that Pliny wasacquainted with glass mirrors, we may thus understand what he saysrespecting an invention which was then new, of applying gold behind amirror. Instead of an amalgam of tin, some one had proposed to coverthe back of the mirror with an amalgam of gold, with which the ancientswere certainly acquainted, and which they employed in gilding." SeeChapter 20 of the present Book. On the above passage by Dr. Watson,Beckmann has the following remarks: "This conjecture appears, at anyrate, to be ingenious; but when I read the passage again, without prejudice,I can hardly believe that Pliny alludes to a plate of glass in a placewhere he speaks only of metallic mirrors; and the overlaying with amalgamrequires too much art to allow me to ascribe it to such a period without sufficient proof. I consider it more probable, that some person hadtried, by means of a polished plate of gold, to collect the rays of light, andto throw them either on the mirror or the object, in order to render theimage brighter."—Hist. Inv. Vol. II. p. 72.</p></body>
