The dungof this last animal, reduced to ashes and taken in the evening,with wine, is good for coughs that are recurrent at night.The smoke, too, of a hare's fur, inhaled, has the effect of bringing off from the lungs such humours as are difficult to be discharged by expectoration. Purulent ulcerations of the chestand lungs, and bad breath proceeding from a morbid state ofthe lungs, are successfully treated with butter boiled with anequal quantity of Attic honey till it assumes a reddish hue, aspoonful of the mixture being taken by the patient everymorning: some persons, however, instead of honey preferusing larch-resin for the purpose. In cases where there are<pb n="5344" />discharges of blood, cow's blood, they say, is good, taken insmall quantities with vinegar; but as to bull's blood, it wouldbe a rash thing to believe in any such recommendation. Forinveterate spitting of blood, bull-glue is taken, in doses of threeoboli, in warm water.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Earn mori tradunt," The reading here is very doubtful.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Subulo."</p></body>
