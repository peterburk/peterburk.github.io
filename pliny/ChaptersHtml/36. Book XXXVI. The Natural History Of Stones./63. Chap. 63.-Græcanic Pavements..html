The ground is well rammed down,and a bed of rough work, or else broken pottery, is then laidupon it. Upon the top of this, a layer of charcoal is placed,well trodden down with a mixture of sand, lime, and ashes; carebeing taken, by line and rule, to give it a uniform thicknessof half a foot. The surface then presents the ordinary appearanceof the ground; but if it is well rubbed with thepolishing-stone, it will have all the appearance of a blackpavement.</p></div2></body>
