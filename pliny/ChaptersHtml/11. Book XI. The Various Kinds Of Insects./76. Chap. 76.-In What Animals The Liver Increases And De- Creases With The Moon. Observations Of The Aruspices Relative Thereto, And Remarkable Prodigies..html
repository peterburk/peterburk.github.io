In the rabbits of B¾tica, the liver is always found tohave a double lobe. Ants will not touch one lobe of the liverof the bramble-frog, in consequence of its poisonous nature, itis generally thought. The liver is remarkable for its powersof preservation, and sieges have afforded us remarkable instances of its being kept so long as a hundred years.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There must be some corrupt reading here; for, as Sillig remarks,who ever heard of a siege which lasted a hundred years?</p></body>
