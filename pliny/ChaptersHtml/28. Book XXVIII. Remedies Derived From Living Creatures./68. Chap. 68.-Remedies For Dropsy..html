Theashes, too, of burnt cow-dung, and of bulls' dung in particular—animals that are reared in herds, I mean—are highly esteemed.This dung, the name given to which is "bolbiton,"<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> is re-duced to ashes, and taken in doses of three spoonfuls to onesemisextarius of honied wine; that of the female animal beingused where the patient is a woman, and that of the other sexin the case of males; a distinction about which the magicianshave made a sort of grand mystery. The dung of a bull-calf isalso applied topically for this disease, and ashes of burnt calves'dung are taken with seed of staphylinos,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> in equal proportions,in wine. Goats' blood also is used, with the marrow; but itis generally thought that the blood of the he-goat is the mostefficacious, when the animal has fed upon lentisk, more particularly.<pb n="5357" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From the Greek.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xix. c. 27, B. xx. c. 15, and B. xxv. c. 64.</p></body>
