<div2 type="chapter" n="13" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 13.ÑREMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE HUMAN EXCRETIONS.</head><p>In Greece, where everything is turned to account, theowners of the gymnasia have introduced the very excretions<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>even of the human body among the most efficient remedies;so much so, indeed, that the scrapings from the bodies of theathletes are looked upon as possessed of certain properties ofan emollient, calorific, resolvent, and expletive nature, resulting from the compound of human sweat and oil. Thesescrapings are used, in the form of a pessary, for inflammationsand contractions of the uterus: similarly employed, they actas an emmenagogue, and are useful for reducing condylomataand inflammations of the rectum, as also for assuaging pains<pb n="5295" />in the sinews, sprains, and nodosities of the joints. Thescrapings obtained from the baths are still more efficacious forthese purposes, and hence it is that they form an ingredient inmaturative preparations. Such scrapings as are impregnatedwith wrestlers' oil,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> used in combination with mud, have amollifying effect upon the joints, and are more particularlyefficacious as a calorific and resolvent; but in other respectstheir properties are not so strongly developed.</p><p>The shameless and disgusting researches that have beenmade will quite transcend all belief, when we find authors ofthe very highest repute proclaiming aloud that the maleseminal fluid is a sovereign remedy for the sting of the scorpion! In the case too, of women afflicted with sterility, theyrecommend the application of a pessary, made of the firstexcrement that is voided by an infant at the moment of itsbirth; the name they give it is "meconium."<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> They haveeven gone so far, too, as to scrape the very filth from off thewalls of the gymnasia, and to assert that this is also possessedof certain calorific properties. These scrapings are used as aresolvent for inflamed tumours, and are applied topically toulcers upon aged people and children, and to excoriations andburns.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xv. c. 5.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Ceroma."
