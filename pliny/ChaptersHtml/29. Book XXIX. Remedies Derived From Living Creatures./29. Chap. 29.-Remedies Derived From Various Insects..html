Any kind of pebble, applied to the woundon the side which has lain next to the ground, will alleviate thepain. A potsherd too, covered with earth on any part of it, andapplied just as it is found, will effect a cure, it is said—theperson, however, who applies it must not look behind him,and must be equally careful that the sun does not shine uponhim. Earth-worms also, are pounded and applied to thewound; in addition to which, they form ingredients in numerousother medicaments, being kept in honey for the purpose.</p><p>For injuries inflicted by bees, wasps, hornets, and leeches,the owlet is considered a very useful remedy; persons, too, whocarry about them the beak of the woodpecker<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> of Mars arenever injured by any of these creatures. The smaller kindsof locusts also, destitute of wings and known as "attelebi,"are a good remedy for the sting of the scorpion.</p><p>There is a kind of venomous ant, by no means common inItaly; Cicero calls it "solipuga," and in Bætica it is knownas "salpuga."<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> The proper remedy for its venom and thatof all kinds of ants is a bat's heart.
