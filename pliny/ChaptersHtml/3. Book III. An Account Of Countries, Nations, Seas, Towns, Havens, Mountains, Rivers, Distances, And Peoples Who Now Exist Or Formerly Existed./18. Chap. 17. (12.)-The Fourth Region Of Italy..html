<div2 type="chapter" n="17" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 17. (12.)ÑTHE FOURTH REGION OF ITALY.</head><p>We now come to the fourth region, which includes themost valiant probably of all the nations of Italy. Upon thecoast, in the territory of the Frentani<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>, after the river Tifernus,we find the river Trinium<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>, with a good harbour at its mouth,the towns of Histonium<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>, Buca<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, and Ortona, and the riverAternus<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>. In the interior are the Anxani surnamed Frentani,the Higher and Lower Carentini<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>, and the Lanuenses; in theterritory of the Marrucini, the Teatini<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>; in that of the Peligni,the Corfinienses<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>, the Super¾quani<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>, and the Sulmonenses<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>;<pb n="1232" />in that of the Marsi, the Anxantini<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>, the Atinates<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>, theFucentes<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>, the Lucenses<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>, and the Marruvini<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>; in that ofthe Albenses, the town of Alba on Lake Fucinus; in thatof the ®quiculani, the Cliternini<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span>, and the Carseolani<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span>; inthat of the Vestini, the Angulani<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span>, the Pinnenses, and thePeltuinates, adjoining to whom are the Aufinates<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> Cismontani; in that of the Samnites, who have been calledSabelli<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span>, and whom the Greeks have called Saunit¾, thecolony of old Bovianum<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span>, and that of the Undecumani,<pb n="1233" />the Aufidenates<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span>, the Esernini<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span>, the Fagifulani, the Ficolenses<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span>, the S¾pinates<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span>, and the Tereventinates; in that ofthe Sabini, the Amiternini<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span>, the Curenses<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span>, Forum Dec”<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span>,Forum Novum, the Fidenates, the Interamnates<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span>, the Nursini<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span>, the Nomentani<span id="ref_31"><a href="#note_31">[31]</a></span>, the Reatini<span id="ref_32"><a href="#note_32">[32]</a></span>, the Trebulani, boththose called Mutusci<span id="ref_33"><a href="#note_33">[33]</a></span> and those called Suffenates<span id="ref_34"><a href="#note_34">[34]</a></span>, the Tiburtes, and the Tarinates.</p><p>In these districts, the Comini<span id="ref_35"><a href="#note_35">[35]</a></span>, the Tadiates, the C¾dici,<pb n="1234" />and the Alfaterni, tribes of the ®quiculi, have disappeared.From Gellianus we learn that Archippe<span id="ref_36"><a href="#note_36">[36]</a></span>, a town of theMarsi, built by Marsyas, a chieftain of the Lydians, hasbeen swallowed up by Lake Fucinus, and Valerianus informsus that the town of the Viticini in Picenum was destroyedby the Romans. The Sabini (called, according to somewriters, from their attention to religious<span id="ref_37"><a href="#note_37">[37]</a></span> observances andthe worship of the gods, Sevini) dwell on the dew-clad hillsin the vicinity of the Lakes of the Velinus<span id="ref_38"><a href="#note_38">[38]</a></span>. The Nar, withits sulphureous waters, exhausts these lakes, and, descendingfrom Mount Fiscellus<span id="ref_39"><a href="#note_39">[39]</a></span>, unites with them near the groves ofVacuna<span id="ref_40"><a href="#note_40">[40]</a></span> and Reate, and then directs its course towards theTiber, into which it discharges itself. Again, in anotherdirection, the Anio<span id="ref_41"><a href="#note_41">[41]</a></span>, taking its rise in the mountain of theTrebani, carries into the Tiber the waters of three lakes remarkable for their picturesque beauty, and to which Subla-<pb n="1235" />queum<span id="ref_42"><a href="#note_42">[42]</a></span> is indebted for its name. In the territory of Reateis the Lake of Cutili¾<span id="ref_43"><a href="#note_43">[43]</a></span>, in which there is a floating island,and which, according to M. Varro, is the navel or centralpoint of Italy. Below the Sabine territory lies that of La-tium, on one side Picenum, and behind it Umbria, whilethe range of the Apennines flanks it on either side.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">They occupied what is now called the Abruzzo Inferiore.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now the Trigno.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">On the site of the present Vasto d'Ammone, five miles south of the Punta della Penna.

Other writers, however, following Pliny, have placed it on the Punta della Penna, where considerable remains were visible in the 17th century. Ortona still retains its ancient name.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now the Pescara.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The sites of their towns are unknown; but D'Anville supposes the Higher or Upper Carentum to have occupied the site of the modern Civita Burella, and the Lower one the Civita del Conte.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Teate is supposed to be the present Chieti.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The people of Corfinium, the chief city of the Peligni.

Mommsen however considers Bojano to be the site of only Bovianum Undecumanorum, or "of the Eleventh Legion," and considers that the site of the ancient Samnite city of Bovianum Vetus is the place called Piettrabondante, near Agnone, twenty miles to the north, where there appear to be the remains of an ancient city.</p><p><span id="note_22"><a href="#ref_22">22. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The people of Aufidena, a city of northern Samnium, in the upper valley of the Sagrus or Sagro.

It is supposed that there were three places of this name. One Cominiun is mentioned in the Samnite wars as being about twenty miles from Aquilonia, while Cominium Ceritum, probably another place, is spoken of by Livy in his account of the second Punic War. The latter, it is suggested, was about sixteen miles north-west of Beneventum, and on the site of the modern Cerreto. The Comini here mentioned by Pliny, it is thought, dwelt in neither of the above places. The sites of the towns of many of the peoples here mentioned are also equally unknown.</p><p><span id="note_36"><a href="#ref_36">36. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Solinus, B. ii., also states, that this place was founded by Marsyas, king of the Lydians.

In order to carry off these waters, a channel was cut through the rocks by Curius Dentatus, the conqueror of the Sabines, by means of which the waters of the Velinus were carried through a narrow gorge to a spot where they fall from a height of several hundred feet into the river Nar. This fall is now known as the Fall of Terni or the Cascade Delle Marmore.</p><p><span id="note_39"><a href="#ref_39">39. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Still called Monte Fiscello, near the town of Civita Reale. Virgil calls the Nar (now the Nera), "Sulphure‰ Nar albus aqu‰," "The white Nar with its sulphureous waters."Ñ®neid, vii. 517.</p><p><span id="note_40"><a href="#ref_40">40. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A Sabine divinity said to have been identical with Victory. The Romans however made her the goddess of leisure and repose, and represented her as being worshiped by the husbandmen at harvest home, when they were "vacui," or at leisure.

In its vicinity was the celebrated villa of Claudius and Nero, called the Villa Sublacencis.</p><p><span id="note_43"><a href="#ref_43">43. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This was a town of the Sabines between Reate and Interocrea, in the vicinity of a small lake of the same name. It was a mere pool, according to Dionysius, being but 400 feet in diameter. It is supposed that the floating island was formed from the incrustations of carbonate of lime on the banks, which, becoming detached, probably collected in the middle. The lake still exists, but the floating island has disappeared. There are some fine ruins of Roman baths in the vicinity of the lake.</p></body>
