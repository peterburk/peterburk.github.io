<div2 type="chapter" n="66" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 66.—THE VARIOUS KINDS OF GLASS, AND THE MODE OFMAKING IT.</head><p>In process of time, as human industry is ingenious in discovering,it was not content with the combination of nitre,but magnet-stone<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> began to be added as well; from the impressionthat it attracts liquefied<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> glass as well as iron. In asimilar manner, too, brilliant stones of various descriptionscame to be added in the melting, and, at last, shells and fossilsand. Some authors tell us, that the glass of India is made ofbroken crystal, and that, in consequence, there is none thatcan be compared to it.</p><p>In fusing it, light and dry wood is used for fuel, Cypriancopper and nitre being added to the melting, nitre of Ophir<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>more particularly. It is melted, like copper, in contiguousfurnaces, and a swarthy mass of an unctuous appearance is theresult. Of such a penetrating nature is the molten glass, thatit will cut to the very bone any part of the body which itmay come near, and that, too, before it is even felt. Thismass is again subjected to fusion in the furnace, for the purposeof colouring it; after which, the glass is either blowninto various forms, turned in a lathe, or engraved<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> like silver.Sidon was formerly famous for its glass-houses, for it was thisplace that first invented<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> mirrors.<pb n="6381" /></p><p>Such was the ancient method of making glass: but, at thepresent day, there is found a very white sand for the purpose,at the mouth of the river Volturnus, in Italy. It spreadsover an extent of six miles, upon the sea-shore that liesbetween Cumæ and Liternum, and is prepared for use bypounding it with a pestle and mortar; which done, it is mixedwith three parts of nitre, either by weight or measure, and,when fused, is transferred to another furnace. Here it formsa mass of what is called "hammonitrum;" which is againsubmitted to fusion, and becomes a mass of pure, white, glass.Indeed, at the present day, throughout the Gallic and Spanishprovinces even, we find sand subjected to a similar process.In the reign of Tiberius, it is said, a combination was devisedwhich produced a flexible<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> glass; but the manufactory of theartist was totally destroyed, we are told, in order to prevent thevalue of copper, silver, and gold, from becoming depreciated.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>This story, however, was, for a long time, more widely spreadthan well authentieated. But be it as it may, it is of littleconsequence; for, in the time of the Emperor Nero, there was aprocess discovered, by which two small glass cups were made,of the kind called "petroti,"<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> the price of which was no lessthan six thousand sesterces!</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Magnes lapis." See B. xxxiv. c. 42, and Chapter 25 of this Book.Beckmann is of opinion that an ore of Manganese is meant, a substancewhich has a resemblance to the magnet, and is of the greatest utility inmaking glass.

Vol. II. p. 237.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This appears to be the meaning of "Quoniam in se liquorem vitriquoque ut ferrum trahere creditur."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In the description given by Isidorus in the "Origines," which in otherrespects is similar, these words are omitted, and it is possible that they area gloss by some one who was better acquainted with the Old Testamentthan with Pliny. On the other hand, as Sillig remarks, the Phœniciansmay, at an early period, have imported into Greece a substance which theycalled "nitre of Ophir."</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See Beckmann, Hist.

Beckmann would seem to give this word theforce only of "thought of," for he gives it as his opinion that attemptswere made at Sidon to form glass mirrors, but that the experiments hadnot completely succeeded. "Had this invention formed an epoch in theart of making mirrors, Pliny, in another place (B. xxxiii. c. 45), wherehe describes the various improvements of it so fully, would not have omittedit: but of those experiments he makes no further mention." He alsoexpresses an opinion that the Sidonian mirrors consisted of dark-colouredglass, resembling obsidian stone."—Hist. Inv.
