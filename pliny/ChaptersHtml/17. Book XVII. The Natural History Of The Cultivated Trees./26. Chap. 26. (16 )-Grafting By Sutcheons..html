(16 )—GRAFTING BY SUTCHEONS.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span></head><p>Grafting by scutcheons would appear to owe its origin tothat by inoculation; but it is suited more particularly to athick bark, such as that of the fig-tree for instance. For thispurpose, all the branches are cut off, in order that they maynot divert the sap, after Which the smoothest part is selected<pb n="3484" />in the stock, and a scutcheon<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> of the bark removed, due carebeing taken that the knife does not go below it. A similarpiece of bark from another tree, with a protuberant bud uponit, is then inserted in its place, care being taken that the unionis so exact that there is no room left for a cicatrix to form, andthe juncture so perfect as to leave no access to either damp orair: still, however, it is always the best plan to protect thescutcheon by means of a plaster of clay and a band. Those whofavour the modern fashions pretend that this method has beenonly discovered in recent times; but the fact is, that we findit employed by the ancient Greeks, and described by Cato,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>who recommends it for the olive and the fig; and he goes sofar as to determine the very dimensions even, in accordancewith his usual exactness. The scutcheon, he says, when takenoff with the knife should be four<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> fingers in length, and threein breadth. It is then fitted to the spot which it is to occupy,and anointed with the mixture of his which has been previosly described.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> This method, too, he recommends for the</p><p>Some persons have adopted another plan with the vine,which consists partly of that of grafting by scutcheon, andpartly by fissure; they first remove a square piece of barkfrom the stock, and then insert a slip in the place that is thuslaid bare. I once saw at Thuliæ,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> near Tibur, a tree that hadbeen grafted<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> upon all these various ways, and loaded with fruitof every kind. Upon one branch there were nuts to be seen,upon another berries, upon another grapes, upon anotherpears, upon another figs, and upon others pomegranates, and<pb n="3485" />several varieties of the apple; the tree, however, was butvery short-lived. But, with all our experiments, we findit quite impossible to rival Nature; for there are someplants that can be reproduced in no other manner than spontaneously, and then only in wild and desert spots. The plane<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>is generally considered the best adapted to receive every kindof graft, and next to it the robur; both of them, however,are very apt to spoil the flavour of the fruit. Some treesadmit of grafting upon them in any fashion, the fig and thepomegranate for instance; the vine, however, cannot begrafted upon by scutcheon, nor, indeed, any other of the treeswhich has a bark that is thin, weak, or cracked. So, too,those trees which are dry, or which contain but little moisture,will not admit of grafting by inoculation. This last method isthe most prolific of them all, and next to it that by scutcheon,but neither of them can be depended upon, and this last moreparticularly; for when the adherence of the bark is the onlypoint of union the scutcheon is liable to be immediately displaced by the slightest gust of wind. Grafting by insertion isthe most reliable method, and the tree so produced will bearmore fruit than one that is merely planted.</p><p>(17.) We must not here omit one very singular circumstance. Corellius, a member of the Equestrian order at Rome,and a native of Ateste, grafted a chesnut, in the territory ofNeapolis, with a slip taken from the same tree, and from thiswas produced the chesnut which is so highly esteemed, andfrom him has derived its name. At a later period again,Etereius, his freedman, grafted the Corellian<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> chesnut afresh.There is this difference between the two; the Corellian ismore prolific, but the Etereian is of superior quality.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Emplastrum."

He thinks itpossible, however, that a kind of mock grafting may have been producedin the case, still employed in some parts of Italy, and known as the"greffe-Diane." A trunk of an orange tree is split, and slips of numeroustrees are than passed into it, which in time throw out their foliage andblossoms in various parts of the tree, or at the top; the consequence ofwhich is, that the stock appears to bear several varieties of blossoms at thesame moment. It is lot improbable that Pliny was thus imposed upon.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The plane and the oak are no longer employed for the purpose.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xv. c. 25.</p></body>
