(18.)ÑTHE WOOD-PECKER OF MARS.</head><p>There are some small birds also, which have hooked talons;the wood-pecker, for example, surnamed "of Mars," of considerable importance in the auspices. To this kind belongthe birds which make holes in trees, and climb stealthily upthem, like cats; mounting with the head upwards, they tapagainst the bark, and learn by the sound whether or not theirfood lies beneath; they are the only birds that hatch theiryoung in the hollows of trees. It is a common belief, that if ashepherd drives a wedge into their holes, they apply a certainkind of herb,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> immediately upon which it falls out. Trebiusinforms us that if a nail or wedge is driven with ever so muchforce into a tree in which these birds have made their nest, itwill instantly fly out, the tree making a loud cracking noisethe moment that the bird has lighted upon the nail or wedge.</p><p>These birds have held the first rank in auguries, in Latium,since the time of the king<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> who has given them their name.One of the presages that was given by them, I cannot passover in silence. A woodpecker came and lighted upon thehead of ®lius Tubero, the City prator, when sitting on histribunal dispensing justice in the Forum, and showed suchtameness as to allow itself to be taken with the hand; uponwhich the augurs declared that if it was let go, the statewas menaced with danger, but if killed, disaster would befall<pb n="2495" />the pr¾tor; in an instant he tore the bird to pieces, and beforelong the omen was fulfilled.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxv. c. 5.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Picus, the son of Saturn, king of Latium.
