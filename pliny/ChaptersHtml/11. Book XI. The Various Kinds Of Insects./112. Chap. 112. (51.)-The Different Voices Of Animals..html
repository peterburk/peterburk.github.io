<div2 type="chapter" n="112" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 112. (51.)—THE DIFFERENT VOICES OF ANIMALS.</head><p>Aristotle<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> is of opinion that no animal has a voice whichdoes not respire, and that hence it is that there is no voice ininsects, but only a noise, through the circulation of the air inthe interior, and its resounding, by reason of its compression.Some insects, again, he says, emit a sort of humming noise,such as the bee, for instance; others a shrill, long-drawn note,like the grasshopper, the two cavities beneath the thorax receiving the air, which, meeting a moveable membrane within,emits a sound by the attrition.—Also that flies, bees, andother insects of that nature, are only heard while they areflying, and cease to be heard the moment they settle, and thatthe sound which they emit proceeds from the friction and theair within them, and not from any act of respiration. At allevents, it is generally believed that the locust emits a soundby rubbing together the wings and thighs, and that amongthe aquatic animals the scallop makes a certain noise as itflies.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> Mollusks, however, and the testaceous animals have novoice and emit no sounds. As for the other fishes, although<pb n="3094" />they are destitute of lungs and the tracheal artery, they arenot entirely without the power of emitting certain sounds: itis only a mere joke to say that the noise which they make isproduced by grating their teeth together. The fish, too, thatis found in the river Acheloüs, and is known as the boar-fish,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>makes a grunting noise, as do some others which we have previously<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> mentioned. The oviparous animals hiss: in theserpent this hissing is prolonged, in the tortoise it is short andabrupt. Frogs make a peculiar noise of their own, as alreadystated;<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> unless, indeed, this, too, is to be looked upon as amatter of doubt; but their noise originates in the mouth, andnot in the thorax. Still, however, in reference to this subject,the nature of the various localities exercises a very considerableinfluence, for in Macedonia, it is said, the frogs are dumb, andthe same in reference to the wild boars there. Among birds,the smaller ones chirp and twitter the most, and more especially about the time of pairing. Others, again, exercise theirvoice while fighting, the quail, for instance; others beforethey begin to fight, such as the partridge; and others whenthey have gained the victory, the dunghill cock, for instance.The males in these species have a peculiar note of their own,while in others, the nightingale for example, the male hasthe same note as the female.</p><p>Some birds sing all the year round, others only at certaintimes of the year, as we have already mentioned when speaking of them individually. The elephant produces a noisesimilar to that of sneezing, by the aid of the mouth, and in-dependently of the nostrils; but by means of the nostrils itemits a sound similar to the hoarse braving of a trumpet.It is only in the bovine race that the voice of the female is thedeepest, it being in all other kinds of animals more shrill thanthat of the male; it is the same also with the male of thehuman race when castrated. The infant at its birth is neverheard to utter a cry before it has entirely left the uterus:it begins to speak at the end of the first year. A son ofCrœsus,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> however, spoke when only six months old, and, whileyet wielding the child's rattle, afforded portentous omens, for<pb n="3095" />it was at the same period that his father's empire fell. Thosechildren which begin to speak the soonest, begin to walk thelatest. The human voice acquires additional strength at thefourteenth year; but in old age it becomes more shrill again,and there is no living creature in which it is subject to morefrequent changes.</p><p>In addition to the preceding, there are still some singularcircumstances that deserve to be mentioned with reference tothe voice. If saw-dust or sand is thrown down in the orchestra of a theatre, or if the walls around are left in a roughstate, or empty casks are placed there, the voice is absorbed;while, on the other hand. if the wall is quite straight, or ifbuilt in a concave form, the voice will move along it, and willconvey words spoken in the slightest whisper from oneend<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> to the other, if there is no inequality in the surface toimpede its progress. The voice, in man, contributes in a greatdegree to form his physiognomy, for we form a knowledge ofa man before we see him by hearing his voice, just as well<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>as if we had seen him with our eyes. There are as manykinds of voices, too, as there are individuals in existence, andeach man has his own peculiar voice, just as much as his ownpeculiar physiognomy. Hence it is, that arises that vast diversity of nations and languages throughout the whole earth:in this, too, originate the many tunes, measures, and inflexionsthat exist. But, before all other things, it is the voice thatserves to express our sentiments,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> a power that distinguishesus from the beasts; just as, in the same way, the various shadesand differences in language that exist among men have createdan equally marked difference between us and the brutes.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hist.
