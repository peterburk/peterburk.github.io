(1 7.)ÑHYDROMELI, OR MELICRATON.</head><p>There is a wine also made solely of honey and water.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> Forthis purpose it is recommended that rain-water<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> should bekept for a period of five years. Those who shew greater skill,content themselves with taking the water just after it hasfallen, and boiling it down to one third, to which they thenadd one third in quantity of old honey, and keep the mixtureexposed to the rays of a hot sun<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> for forty days after therising of the Dog-star; others, however, rack it off in thecourse of ten days, and tightly cork the vessels in which it iskept. This beverage is known as "hydromeli," and with ageacquires the flavour of wine. It is nowhere more highlyesteemed than in Phrygia.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Mead, or metheglin, See B. xxii. c. 51.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There is no ground, FŽe says, for this recommendation.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Stoves are now used for this purpose.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Hydromeølum," on the other hand, made of water and apples, wasthe same as our modern cider.</p></body>
