THE ORDINANCE OF KING NUMA AS TO FISH.</head><p>Cassius Hemina informs us that sea-fish have been in useat Rome from the time of its foundation. I will give his ownwords, however, upon the subject:—"Numa ordained that fishwithout<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> scales should not be served up at the Festivals ofthe Gods; a piece of frugality, the intention of which was,that the banquets, both public and private, as well as therepasts laid before the couches<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> of the gods, might be providedat a smaller expense than formerly: it being also hiswish to preclude the risk that the caterers for the sacredbanquets would spare no expense in buying provisions, and soforestall the market."</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We learn from Festus, that he prohibited the use also of the scarus,a fish <hi rend="ital">with</hi> scales.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Ad pulvinaria." Literally, "At the cushions;" in reference tothe practice of placing the statues of the gods upon pillows at the Lectisternia,which were sacrifices in the nature of feasts, at which images ofthe gods were placed reclining on couches, with tables and food beforethem, as if they were really partaking of the things offered in sacrifice.Livy, B. v. c. 13. gives an account of a Lectisternium celebrated with greatpomp, which he asserts to have been the first instance of the practice.</p></body>
