The lower partof all feathers is hollow; if cut, they will not grow again, but ifpulled out, they will shoot afresh. Insects fly by the aid of afrail membrane; the wings of the fish<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> called the "swallow" aremoistened in the sea, while those of the bat which frequentsour houses are dry; the wings of this last animal have certainarticulations as well. The hairs that issue from a thick skinare rough, while those on females are of a finer quality. Thosefound on the horse's mane are more abundant, which is thecase also with the shoulders of the lion. The dasypus hashair in the inside of the mouth even and under the feet, twofeatures which Trogus has also attributed to the hare; fromwhich the same author concludes that hairy men are the mostprone to lust. The most hairy of all animals is the hare.Man is the only creature that has hair as the mark of puberty;and a person who is devoid of this, whether male or female,is sure to be sterile. The hair of man is partly born withhim, and in part produced after his birth. The last kind of hairwill not grow upon eunuchs, though that which has been bornwith them does not fall off; which is the case also withwomen, in a great degree. Still however, there have beenwomen known to be afflicted with falling off of the hair, justas some are to be seen with a fine down on the face, after thecessation of the menstrual discharge. In some men the hairthat mostly shoots forth after birth will not grow spontaneously. The hair of quadrupeds comes off every year, and<pb n="3082" />grows again. That of the head in man grows the fastest, andnext to it the hair of the beard. When cut, the hairs shoot,not from the place where they have been cut, as is the casewith grass, but at the root. The hair grows quickly in certain diseases, phthisis more particularly; it grows also withrapidity in old age, and on the body after death. In personsof a libidinous tendency the hair that is produced at birth fallsoff more speedily, while that which is afterwards producedgrows with the greatest rapidity. In quadrupeds, the hairgrows thicker in old age; but on those with wool, it becomesthinner. Those quadrupeds which have thick hair on theback, have the belly quite smooth. From the hides of oxen,and that of the bull more especially, glue is extracted byboiling.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. ix. c. 43.</p></body>
