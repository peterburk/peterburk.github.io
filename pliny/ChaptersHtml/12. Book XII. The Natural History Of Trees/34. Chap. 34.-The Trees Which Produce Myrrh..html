Some authors have said that the barkis smooth like that of the arbute, others, that it is rough andcovered with thorns: it has the leaf of the olive, but more wavy,with sharp points at the edges: Juba says, however, that itresembles the leaf of the olusatrum. Some again say that itresembles the juniper,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> only that it is rougher and bristlingwith thorns, and that the leaves are of a rounder shape, thoughthey have exactly the taste of the juniper. There have beensome writers who have incorrectly asserted that both myrrhand frankincense are the product of the same tree.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Theophrastus says the terebinth.</p></body>
