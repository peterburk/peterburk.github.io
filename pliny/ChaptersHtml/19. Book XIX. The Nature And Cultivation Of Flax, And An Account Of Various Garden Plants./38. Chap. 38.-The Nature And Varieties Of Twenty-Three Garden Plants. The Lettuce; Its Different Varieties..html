<div2 type="chapter" n="38" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 38.—THE NATURE AND VARIETIES OF TWENTY-THREEGARDEN PLANTS. THE LETTUCE; ITS DIFFERENT VARIETIES.</head><p>The Greeks have distinguished three varieties of the lettuce<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>;the first with a stalk so large, that small garden gates<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>, it issaid, have been made of it: the leaf of this lettuce is somewhat larger than that of the herbaceous, or green lettuce, butextremely narrow, the nutriment seeming to be expended onthe other parts of the plant. The second kind is that with arounded<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> stalk; and the third is the low, squat lettuce<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> generally known as the Laconian lettuce.<pb n="4181" /></p><p>Some persons<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> have made distinctions in reference to theirrespective colours, and the times for sowing them: the blacklettuce is sown in the month of January, the white in March,and the red in April; and they are fit for transplanting, all ofthem, at the end of a couple of months. Those, again, whohave pursued these enquiries even further than this, have distinguished a still greater number of varieties of them—thepurple, the crisped, the Cappadocian,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> and the Greek lettuce,this last having a longer leaf than the rest, and a broad stalk:in addition to which, there is one with a long, narrow leaf,very similar to endive in appearance. The most inferior kind,however, of all, is the one to which the Greeks, censuring itfor its bitterness, have given the name of "picris."<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> There isstill another variety, a kind of white lettuce, called "meconis,"<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>a name which it derives from the abundance of milk, of anarcotic quality, which it produces; though, in fact, it is generally thought that they are all of them of a soporific tendency.In former times, this last was the only kind of lettuce thatwas held in any esteem<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> in Italy, the name "lactuca" havingbeen given it on account of the milk<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> which it contains.</p><p>The purple kind, with a very large root, is generally knownas the Cæcilian<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> lettuce; while the round one, with an extremely diminutive root and broad leaves, is known to somepersons as the "astytis,"<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> and to others as the "eunychion,"it having the effect, in a remarkable degree, of quenching theamorous propensities. Indeed, they are, all of them, possessedof cooling and refreshing properties, for which reason it is,that they are so highly esteemed in summer; they have theeffect, also, of removing from the stomach distaste for food,and of promoting the appetite. At all events, we find itstated, that the late Emperor Augustus, when ill, was saved<pb n="4182" />on one occasion<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>, thanks to the skill of his physician, Musa<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>,by eating lettuces, a food which the excessive scruples of hisformer physician, C. Æmilius, had forbidden him. At thepresent day, however, lettuces have risen into such high estimation, that a method has been discovered even of preservingthem during the months in which they are out of season, bykeeping them in oxymel<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>. It is generally supposed, also,that lettuces have the effect of making blood.</p><p>In addition to the above varieties, there is another kind oflettuce known as the "goats' lettuce,"<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> of which we shall haveoccasion to make further mention when we come to the medicinal plants: at the moment, too, that I am writing this, anew species of cultivated lettuce has been introduced, knownas the Cilician lettuce, and held in very considerable esteem;the leaf of it is similar to that of the Cappadocian lettuce,except that it is crisped, and somewhat larger.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Lactuca sativa of Linnæus.
