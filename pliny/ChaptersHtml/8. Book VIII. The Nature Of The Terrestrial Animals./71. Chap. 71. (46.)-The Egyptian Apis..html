<div2 type="chapter" n="71" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 71. (46.)ÑTHE EGYPTIAN APIS. <span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span></head><p>In Egypt an ox is even worshipped as a deity; they call itApis. It is distinguished by a conspicuous white spot on theright side, in the form of a crescent. There is a knot also underthe tongue, which is called "cantharus."<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> This ox is notallowed to live beyond a certain number of years; it is then destroyed by being drowned in the fountain of the priests. Theythen go, amid general mourning, and seek another ox to replaceit; and the mourning is continued, with their heads shaved,until such time as they have found one; it is not long, however,at any time, before they meet with a successor. When one hasbeen found, it is brought by the priests to Memphis. Thereare two temples appropriated to it, which are called thalami,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>and to these the people resort to learn the auguries. According as the ox enters the one or the other of these places, theaugury is deemed favourable or unfavourable. It givesanswers to individuals, by taking food from the hand of thosewho consult it. It turned away from the hand of GermanicusC¾sar, and not long after he died.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> In general it lives insecret; but, when it comes forth in public, the multitudesmake way for it, and it is attended by a crowd of boys, singinghymns in honour of it; it appears to be sensible of the adorationthus paid to it, and to court it. These crowds, too, suddenlybecome inspired, and predict future events. Once in the yeara female is presented to the ox, which likewise has her appro-<pb n="2331" />priate marks, although different from those on the male; andit is said that she is always killed the very same day thatthey find her. There is a spot in the Nile, near Memphis,which, from its figure, they call Phiala;<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> here they throw intothe water a dish of gold, and another of silver, every year uponthe days on which they celebrate the birth of Apis.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> Thesedays are seven in number, and it is a remarkable thing, thatduring this time, no one is ever attacked by the crocodile; onthe eighth day, however, after the sixth hour, these beastsresume all their former ferocity.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We have an account of Apis in Herodotus, B. iii. c. 28; also in Pomponius Mela, B. i. c. 9; and in, ®lian, Anim.
