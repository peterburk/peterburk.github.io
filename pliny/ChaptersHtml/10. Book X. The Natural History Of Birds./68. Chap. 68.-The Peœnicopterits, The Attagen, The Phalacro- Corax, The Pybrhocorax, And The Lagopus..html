<div2 type="chapter" n="68" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 68.—THE PEŒNICOPTERITS, THE ATTAGEN, THE PHALACRO-CORAX, THE PYBRHOCORAX, AND THE LAGOPUS.</head><p>Apicius, that very deepest whirlpool of all our epicures, hasinformed us that the tongue of the phœnicopterus<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> is of themost exquisite flavour. The attagen,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> also, of Ionia is a famous<pb n="2529" />bird; but although it has a voice at other times, it is mute incaptivity. It was formerly<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> reckoned among the rare birds,but at the present day it is found in Gallia, Spain, and in theAlps even; which is also the case with the phalacrocorax,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> abird peculiar to the Balearic Isles, as the pyrrhocorax,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> a blackbird with a yellow bill, is to the Alps, and the lagopus,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> whichis esteemed for its excellent flavour. This last bird derivesits name from its feet, which are covered, as it were, with thefur of a hare, the rest of the body being white, and the size ofa pigeon. It is not an easy matter to taste it out of its nativecountry, as it never becomes domesticated, and when dead itquickly spoils.</p><p>There is another<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> bird also, which has the same name, andonly differs from the quail in size; it is of a saffron colour,and is most delicate eating. Egnatius Calvinus, who was prefect there, pretends that he has seen<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> in the Alps the ibis also,a bird that is peculiar to Egypt.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Literally, the "red-wing." The modem flamingo.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Buffon thinks that this is the grouse of the English, the Tetrao Scoti-cus of the naturalists; but Cuvier is of opinion that it is either the common wood-cock, the Tetrao bonasia of Linnæus, or else the wood-cock withpointed tail, of the south of Europe, the Tetrao alchata of Linnæus, mostprobably the latter, as the male has black and blue spots on the back; afact which may explain the joke in the "Birds" of Aristophanes, where arun-away slave who has been marked with stripes, is called an attagen. Bysome it is called the "red-headed hazel-hen."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In allusion, perhaps, to the words of Horace, Epod. ii. 54.Non attagen Ionicus<lb />Jucundior, quam lecta de pinguissimis<lb />Oliva ramis arborum.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Literally, the "bald crow." Pliny, B. xi. c. 47, says that it is anaquatic bird: and naturalists generally identify it with the cormorant, thePelecanus carbo of Linnæus.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Literally, the red crow, the chocard of the Alps, the Corvus pyrrhocorax of Linnæus.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The "hare's foot." Identical with the snow partridge, the Tetraolagopus of Linnæus; it is white in winter.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The same bird, Cuvier says, as seen in summer, being then of asaffron colour, with blackish spots.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier remarks, that the green courlis, the Scolopax falcinellus ofLinnus, which is not imrobably the real ibis of the ancients, is by nomeans uncommon in Italy.</p></body>
