At Trœzen, on the contrary, allthe inhabitants are subject to diseases of the feet, owing to thebad quality of the water there. The state of the Tungri,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> in<pb n="5476" />Gaul, has a spring of great renown, which sparkles as itbursts forth with bubbles innumerable, and has a certainferruginous taste, only to be perceived after it has beendrunk. This water is strongly purgative, is curative of tertianfevers, and disperses urinary calculi: upon the application offire it assumes a turbid appearance, and finally turns red. Thesprings<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> of Leucogæa, between Puteoli and Neapolis, arecurative of eye diseases and of wounds. Cicero, in his workentitled "Admiranda,"<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> has remarked that it is only by thewaters of the marshes of Reate<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> that the hoofs of beasts ofburden are hardened.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot"><foreign lang="greek">)/Alfos;</foreign> from which the lake probably derived its name. It hasbeen suggested that the source of the river Anigrus in Elis is meant. Itswaters had an offensive smell, and its fish were not eatable; and near itwere caverns sacred to the Nymphs Anigrides, where persons with cutaneousdiseases were cured. The water of these caverns is impregnated withsulphur.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Possibly the M.
