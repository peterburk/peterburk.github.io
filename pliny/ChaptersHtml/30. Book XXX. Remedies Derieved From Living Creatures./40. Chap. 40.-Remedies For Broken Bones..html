For broken bones, adog's brains are used, spread upon a linen cloth, with woollaid upon the surface and moistened every now and then. Thefractured bone will mostly unite in the course of fourteendays; and a cure equally expeditious may be effected by usingthe ashes of burnt field-mice, with honey, or of burnt earthworms; a substance which is extremely useful for the extraction of splintered bones.</p></div2></body>
