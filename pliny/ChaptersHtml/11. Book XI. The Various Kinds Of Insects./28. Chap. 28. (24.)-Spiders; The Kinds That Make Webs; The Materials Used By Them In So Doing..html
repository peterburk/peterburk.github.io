(24.)—SPIDERS; THE KINDS THAT MAKE WEBS; THEMATERIALS USED BY THEM IN SO DOING.</head><p>It is by no means an absurdity to append to the silk-worman account of the spider, a creature which is worthy of ourespecial admiration. There are numerous kinds of spiders, however, which it will not be necessary here to mention, from thefact of their being so well known. Those that bear the name of<hi rend="ital">phalangium</hi> are of small size, with bodies spotted and running to a point; their bite is venomous, and they leap as theymove from place to place. Another kind, again, is black, andthe fore-legs are remarkable for their length. They have all ofthem three joints in the legs. The smaller kind of wolf-spider<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>does not make a web, but the larger ones make their holes inthe earth, and spread their nets at the narrow entrance thereof.A third kind, again, is remarkable for the skill which it displays in its operations. These spin a large web, and the abdomen suffices to supply the material for so extensive a work,whether it is that, at stated periods the excrements are largelysecreted in the abdomen, as Democritus thinks, or that thecreature has in itself a certain faculty of secreting<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> a peculiarsort of woolly substance. How steadily does it work with itsclaws, how beautifully rounded and how equal are the threadsas it forms its web, while it employs the weight of its body asan equipoise! It begins at the middle to weave its web, andthen extends it by adding the threads in rings around, like awarp upon the woof: forming the meshes at equal intervals,but continually enlarging them as the web increases in breadth,it finally unites them all by an indissoluble knot. With whatwondrous art does it conceal the snares that lie in waitfor its prey in its checkered nettings! How little, too, wouldit seem that there is any such trap laid in the compactness of<pb n="3028" />its web and the tenacious texture of the woof, which wouldappear of itself to be finished and arranged by the exercise ofthe very highest art! How loose, too, is the body of the webas it yields to the blasts, and how readily does it catch all objectswhich come in its way! You would fancy that it had left,quite exhausted, the thrums of the upper portion of its netunfinished where they are spread across; it is with the greatest difficulty that they are to be perceived, and yet the momentthat an object touches them, like the lines of the hunter's net,they throw it into the body of the web. With what architectural skill, too, is its hole arched over, and how well defended by a nap of extra thickness against the cold! Howcarefully, too, it retires into a corner, and appears intent uponanything but what it really is, all the while that it is so carefully shut up from view, that it is impossible to perceive whether there is anything within or not! And then too, how extraordinary the strength of the web! When is the wind everknown to break it, or what accumulation of dust is able toweigh it down?</p><p>The spider often spreads its web right across between twotrees, when plying its art and learning how to spin; and then,as to its length, the thread extends from the very top of thetree to the ground, while the insect springs up again in aninstant from the earth, and travels aloft by the very self-samethread, thus mounting at the same moment and spinningits threads. When its prey falls into its net, how on the alertit is, and with what readiness it runs to seize it! Eventhough it should be adhering to the very edge of its web, theinsect always runs instantly to the middle, as it is by thesemeans that it can most effectually shake the web, and so successfully entangle its prey. When the web is torn, thespider immediately sets about repairing it, and that so neatly,that nothing like patching can ever be seen. The spider liesin wait even for the young of the lizard, and after envelopingthe head of the animal, bites its lips; a sight by no meansunworthy of the amphitheatre itself, when it is one's good fortune to witness it. Presages also are drawn from the spider;for when a river is about to swell, it will suspend its webhigher than usual. In calm weather these insects do not spin,but when it is cloudy they do, and hence it is, that a greatnumber of cobwebs is a sure sign of showery weather. It is<pb n="3029" />generally supposed that it is the female spider that spins,and the male that lies in wait for prey, thus making an equaldivision of their duties.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Aranea lupus of Linnæus.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">As Cuvier observes, he has here guessed at the truth.</p></body>
