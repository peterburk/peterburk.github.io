All kinds of paste that are used for this purpose,ought not to be older or newer than one day. The paper isthen thinned out with a mallet, after which a new layer ofpaste is placed upon it; then the creases which have formedare again pressed out, and it then undergoes the same processwith the mallet as before. It is thus that we have memorialspreserved in the ancient handwriting of Tiberius and CaiusGracchus, which I have seen in the possession of PomponiusSecundus,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> the poet, a very illustrious citizen, almost twohundred years since those characters were penned. As for thehandwriting of Cicero, Augustus, and Virgil, we frequentlysee them at the present day.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. vii. c. 18, and B. xiv. c. 6.
