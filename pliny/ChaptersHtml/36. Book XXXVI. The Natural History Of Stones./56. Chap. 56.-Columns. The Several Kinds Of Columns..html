<div2 type="chapter" n="56" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 56.—COLUMNS. THE SEVERAL KINDS OF COLUMNS.</head><p>The more closely columns are placed together, the thickerthey appear to be. There are four different kinds of pillars.Those of which the diameter at the foot is one-sixth partof the height, are called Doric. When the diameter is one-ninth,they are Ionic; and when it is one-seventh, Tuscan.The proportions in the Corinthian are the same as those ofthe Ionic; but they differ in the circumstance that theCorinthian capitals are of the same height as the diameterat the foot, a thing that gives them a more slender appearance;whereas, in the Ionic column, the height of thecapital is only one-third of the diameter at the foot. In<pb n="6375" />ancient times the rule was, that the columns should be one-thirdof the breadth of the temple in height.</p><p>It was in the Temple of Diana, at Ephesus, as originallybuilt, that spirals<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> were first placed beneath, and capitalsadded: and it was determined that the diameter of the shaftsshould be one-eighth of their height, and that the spiralsshould be one-half of the diameter in height, the upper extremityof the shaft being one-seventh less in diameter thanthe foot. In addition to these columns, there are what arecalled "Attic" columns, quadrangular, and with equal sides.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It seems difficult to understand whether by the word "spiræ" hemeans astragals, or bases. It would almost appear, by the use of the word"subditæ," that it is "bases" for the shafts. It is just possible, however,that the meaning may be that the "spire" were placed <hi rend="ital">beneath</hi> thecapitals which were added.</p></body>
