<div2 type="chapter" n="47" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 47. (22.)—PHŒNICOBALANUS.</head><p>The fruit of the palm in Egypt, which is known by thename of adipsos,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> is put to a similar use in unguents, and isheld next in esteem after the myrobalanum. It is of a greencolour, has exactly the smell of a quince, and has no stone ornut within. It is gathered a little before it begins to ripen.That which is left ungathered is known as phœnicobalanus;<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>it turns black, and has a tendency to inebriate the person whoeats of it. The price of myrobalanum is two denarii per pound.The shop-keepers give this name also to the dregs of theunguent that is made with it.<pb n="3144" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Curing thirst." Dioscorides, B. i. c. 148, says that it was so calledfrom being full of juice, which quenched thirst like water.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Palm-nut." Fée thinks it not improbable that one of the date-palms is meant, if we may judge from the name. He suggests that possi-bly the Elais or avoira of Guinea, the Elais Guineensis, which is found asfar as Upper Egypt, and which produces a fine oil known as palm-oil, ismeant, or possibly the Douma Thebaica, a palm-tree frequently met within Egypt. On fermentation, a vinous drink is extracted from the last,which is capable of producing intoxication.</p></body>
