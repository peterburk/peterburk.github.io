There is one which resembles the terebinth<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> in everyrespect, except the fruit, which is very similar to the almond,though less in size, and remarkable for its extreme sweetness.This tree was met with in Bactria, and some persons lookedupon it as a variety of the terebinth, rather than as bearing astrong resemblance to it. As to the tree from which theymanufacture a kind of linen<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> cloth, in leaf it resembles themulberry-tree, while the calix of the fruit is similar to thedog-rose.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> This tree is reared in the plains, and there is nosight throughout the cultivated parts of the country that ismore enchanting than the plantations of it.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See Theophrastus, B. iv. c. 5.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Dalechamps and Desfontaines are of opinion, that the pistachio, orPistacia terebinthus of Linnæus, is here alluded to; but Fée considers thatthere are no indications to lead to such a conclusion.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is not improbable that he may here allude to the cotton-tree, ofwhich further mention is made in c. xxi. of the present Book.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Fée is of opinion that Cynorrhodon here means, not the dog-rose, butthe gall which is formed on the tree by the sting of the Cynips bedeguar.</p></body>
