This tree yields a morecopious supply of resin than the pine: the mode in which thisis done we shall set forth<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> on a future occasion. It growsalso in flat countries. Many people think that this is thesame tree that grows along the shores of Italy, and is knownas the "tibulus;"<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> but this last is slender, and more com-pact than the pine; it is likewise free from knots, and henceis used in the construction of light gallies;<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> they are both almostentirely destitute of resin.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In c. 23 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A variety of the Pinus silvestris of Linn¾us.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Liburnic¾."
