<div2 type="chapter" n="1" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 1. (1.)—TASTE OF THE ANCIENTS FOR AGRICULTURE.</head><p>WE now pass on to the Natural History of the various grains,of the garden plants and flowers, and indeed of all the otherproductions, with the exception of the trees and shrubs, whichthe Earth, in her bounteousness, affords us—a boundless fieldfor contemplation, if even we regard the herbs alone, when wetake into consideration the varieties of them, their numbers,the flowers they produce, their odours, their colours, theirjuices, and the numerous properties they possess—all of whichhave been engendered by her with a view to either the preservation or the gratification of the human race.</p><p>On entering, however, upon this branch of my subject, it ismy wish in the first place to plead the cause of the Earth, andto act as the advocate of her who is the common parent of all,although in the earlier<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> part of this work I have already hadoccasion to speak in her defence. For my subject matter, as Iproceed in the fulfillment of my task, will now lead me to consider her in the light of being the producer of various noxioussubstances as well; in consequence of which it is that we arein the habit of charging her with our crimes, and imputing toher a guilt that is our own. She has produced poisons, it istrue; but who is it but man that has found them out? Forthe birds of the air and the beasts of the field, it is sufficient tobe on their guard against them, and to keep at a distance fromthem. The elephant, we find, and the gurus, know how to<pb n="4002" />sharpen<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and renovate their teeth against the trunks of trees,and the rhinoceros against rocks; wild boars, again, pointtheir tusks like so many poniards by the aid of both rocks andtrees; and all animals, in fact, are aware how to prepare themselves for the infliction of injury upon others; but still, whichis there among them all, with the exception of man, that dipshis weapons in poison? As for ourselves, we envenom thepoint of the arrow,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and we contrive to add to the destructivepowers of iron itself; by the aid of poisons we taint the watersof the stream, and we infect the various elements of Nature;indeed, the very air even, which is the main support of life,we turn into a medium for the destruction of life.</p><p>And it is not that we are to suppose that animals are ignorant of these means of defence, for we have already had occasion to point out<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> the preparations which they make against theattacks of the serpent, and the methods they devise for effectinga cure when wounded by it; and yet, among them all, thereis not one that fights by the aid of the poison that belongs toanother, with the sole exception of man. Let us then candidlyconfess our guilt, we who are not contented even with thepoisons as Nature has produced them; for by far the greaterportion of them, in fact, are artificially prepared by the humanhand!</p><p>And then besides, is it not the fact, that there are manymen, the very existence of whom is a baneful poison, as itwere? Like that of the serpent, they dart their livid tongue,and the venom of their disposition corrodes every object uponwhich it concentrates itself. Ever vilifying and maligning,like the ill-omened birds of the night, they disturb the reposeof that darkness which is so peculiarly their own, and breakin upon the quiet of the night even, by their moans and wailings, the only sounds they are ever heard to emit. Likeanimals of inauspicious presage, they only cross our path to<pb n="4003" />prevent us from employing our energies or becoming useful toour fellow-men; and the only enjoyment that is sought bytheir abominable aspirations is centred in their universal hatredof mankind.</p><p>Still, however, even in this respect Nature has asserted hermajestic sway; for how much more numerous<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> are the goodand estimable characters which she has produced! just in thesame proportion that we find her giving birth to productionswhich are at once both salutary and nutritious to man. It is inour high esteem for men such as these, and the commendationsthey bestow, that we shall be content to leave the others, likeso many brakes and brambles, to the devouring flames of theirown bad passions, and to persist in promoting the welfare ofthe human race; and this, with all the more energy and perseverance, from the circumstance that it has been our objectthroughout, rather to produce a work of lasting utility than toensure ourselves a widely-spread renown. We have only tospeak, it is true, of the fields and of rustic operations; butstill, it is upon these that the enjoyment of life so materiallydepends, and that the ancients conferred the very highest rankin their honors and commendations.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. ii. c. 63.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Of course this is only mere declamation; it is not probable that the animals have any notion at all of <hi rend="ital">sharpening</hi> the weapons that nature has given; in addition to which, this mode of sharpening them against hard substances would only wear away the enamel, and ultimately destroy them.
