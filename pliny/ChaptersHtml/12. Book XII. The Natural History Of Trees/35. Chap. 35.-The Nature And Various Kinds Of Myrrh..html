<div2 type="chapter" n="35" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 35.—THE NATURE AND VARIOUS KINDS OF MYRRH.</head><p>Incisions are made in the myrrh-tree also twice a year, and atthe same season as in the incense-tree; but in the case of themyrrh-tree they are all made the way up from the root as far asthe branches which are able to bear it. The tree spontaneouslyexudes, before the incision is made, a liquid which bears thename of stacte,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and to which there is no myrrh that is superior. Second only in quality to this is the cultivated myrrh:of the wild or forest kind, the best is that which is gathered insummer. They give no tithes of myrrh to the god, because itis the produce of other countries as well; but the growers paythe fourth part of it to the king of the Gebanitæ. Myrrh isbought up indiscriminately by the common people, and thenpacked into bags; but our perfumers separate it without anydifficulty, the principal tests of its goodness being its unctuousness and its aromatic smell. (16.) There are several<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> kinds<pb n="3131" />of myrrh; the first among the wild myrrhs is the Troglodytic; and the next are the Minæan, which includes theAtramitic, and that of Ausaritis, in the kingdom of the Gebanitæ. A third kind is the Dianitic,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and a fourth is themixed myrrh, or "all-sorts;"<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> a fifth, again, is the Sambracenian, which is brought from a city in the kingdom of theSabæi, near the sea; and a sixth is known by the name ofDusaritic. There is a white myrrh also, which is produced inonly one spot, and is carried for sale to the city of Messalum.The Troglodytic myrrh is tested by its unctuousness, and itspeculiarly dry appearance: it has also a dirty, rough lookwith it, but is more acrid than the other kinds. The Sambracenian myrrh has none of these faults, and is more sightly inappearance than any of them, though it is far from beingso powerful. In general, however, the proof of its goodnessconsists in its being separated in little pieces of uneven shape,formed by the concretion of a whitish juice, which dries uplittle by little. When broken it ought to exhibit white markslike the finger-nails, and to be slightly bitter to the taste.That of second quality is of a mottled appearance within;while of worse quality is that which is of a black colourwithin; the very worst of all is that which is black on theoutside as well.</p><p>The price of myrrh varies according to the number of purchasers. Stacte is sold at prices which vary from three denarii to forty per pound, while the very highest price of thecultivated myrrh is eleven denarii. Erythræan myrrh, thesame, it is pretended, as Arabian myrrh, is sixteen denarii perpound, Troglodytic also, is sixteen denarii; and that known asodoraria, or odoriferous myrrh, sells at fourteen. Myrrh isadulterated with pieces of mastich, and other gums; it is alsodrugged with the juice of wild cucumber, in order to producea certain bitterness, and with litharge for the purpose of increasing its weight. Other sophistications may be discoveredon tasting it, and the gum will adhere to the teeth. But the<pb n="3132" />cleverest mode of adulterating it is with Indian myrrh,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> asubstance which is gathered from a certain prickly shrub whichgrows there. This is the only thing that India produces ofworse quality than the corresponding produce of other countries: they may, however, be very easily distinguished, thatof India being so very much inferior.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From the Greek <foreign lang="greek">sta/zw,</foreign> "to drop." Fée observes, that the modernsknow nothing positive as to the mode of extracting myrrh from the tree.See the account given by Ovid, Met. B. x. 1. 500 <hi rend="ital">et seq.</hi> of the transformation of Myrrha into this tree,—" The warm drops fall from the tree. Thetears, even, have their own honour; and the myrrh that distils from thebark bears the name of its mistress, and in no age will remain unknown."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Fée remarks, that at the present day we are acquainted only with onekind of myrrh; the fragments which bear an impression like those of nailsbeing not a distinct kind, but a simple variety in appearance only. Hethinks, also, that Pliny may very possibly be describing several distinctresinous products, under the one name of myrrh. An account of thesevarious districts will be found in B. vi. c. 32.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hardouin suggests that it may be so called from the island of Dia,mentioned by Strabo, B. xvi.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Collatitia." The reading, however, is very doubtful.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">What this was is now unknown. Fée suggests that it may have beenbdellium, which is found in considerable quantities in the myrrh that isimported at the present day.</p></body>
