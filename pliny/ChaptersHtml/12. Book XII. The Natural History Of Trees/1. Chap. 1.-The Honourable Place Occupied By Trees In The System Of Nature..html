It now remains for us to speak ofthe vegetable productions of the earth, which are equally farfrom being destitute of a vital spirit,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> (for, indeed, nothing canlive without it), that we may then proceed to describe the minerals extracted from it, and so none of the works of Nature maybe passed by in silence. Long, indeed, were these last bounties of hers concealed beneath the ground, the trees and forestsbeing regarded as the most valuable benefits conferred by Nature upon mankind. It was from the forest that man drewhis first aliment, by the leaves of the trees was his cave rendered more habitable, and by their bark was his clothing supplied; even at this very day,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> there are nations that liveunder similar circumstances to these. Still more and more,then, must we be struck with wonder and admiration, thatfrom a prim¾val state such as this, we should now be cleavingthe mountains for their marbles, visiting the Seres<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> to obtainour clothing, seeking the pearl in the depths of the Red Sea,and the emerald in the very bowels of the earth. For ouradornment with these precious stones it is that we have devisedthose wounds which we make in our ears; because, forsooth,it was deemed not enough to carry them on our hands, ournecks, and our hair, if we did not insert them in our very fleshas well. It will be only proper, then, to follow the order ofhuman inventions, and to speak of the trees before treating of<pb n="3102" />other subjects; thus may we trace up to their very origin themanners and usages of the present day.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Anim‰."
