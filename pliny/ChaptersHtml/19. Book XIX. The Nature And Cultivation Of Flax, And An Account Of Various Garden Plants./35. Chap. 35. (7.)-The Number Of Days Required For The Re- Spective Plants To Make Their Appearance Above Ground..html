<div2 type="chapter" n="35" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 35. (7.)—THE NUMBER OF DAYS REQUIRED FOR THE RE-SPECTIVE PLANTS TO MAKE THEIR APPEARANCE ABOVE GROUND.</head><p>Among the garden<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> plants which make their appearancemost speedily above ground, are ocimum, blite, the turnip, androcket; for they appear above the surface the third day afterthey are sown. Anise, again, comes up on the fourth day, thelettuce on the fifth, the radish on the sixth, the cucumber andthe gourd on the seventh—the cucumber rather the first of thetwo—cresses and mustard on the fifth, beet on the sixth dayin summer and the tenth in winter, orage on the eighth, onionson the nineteenth or twentieth, and scallions on the tenthor twelfth. Coriander, again, is more stubborn in its growth,cunila and wild marjoram do not appear till after the thirtiethday, and parsley comes up with the greatest difficulty of all,for at the very earliest it is forty days before it shows itself,and in most instances as much as fifty.</p><p>The age<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>, too, of the seed is of some importance in this respect; for fresh seed comes up more rapidly in the case of theleek, the scallion, the cucumber, and the gourd, while in thatof parsley, beet, cardamum, cunila, wild majoram, and coriander, seed that has been kept for some time is the best.</p><p>There is one remarkable circumstance<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> in connection withthe seed of beet; it does not all germinate in the first year, butsome of it in the second, and some in the third even; henceit is that a considerable quantity of seed produces only a verymoderate crop. Some plants produce only in the year in whichthey are set, and some, again, for successive years, parsley,leeks, and scallions<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> for instance; indeed, these plants, whenonce sown, retain their fertility, and produce for many years.<pb n="4178" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The whole nearly of this Chapter is borrowed from Theophrastus,Hist.
