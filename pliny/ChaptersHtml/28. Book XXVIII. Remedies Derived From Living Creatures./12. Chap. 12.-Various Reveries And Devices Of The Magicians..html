When a person has beenstruck by lightning, if the body is turned upon the side whichhas sustained the injury, he will instantly recover the power<pb n="5294" />of speech—that is quite certain.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> For the cure of inguinaltumours, some persons take the thrum of an old web, and aftertying seven or nine knots in it, mentioning at each knot thename of some widow woman or other, attach it to the partaffected. To assuage the pain of a wound, they recommendthe party to take a nail or any other substance that has beentrodden under foot, and to wear it, attached to the body withthe thrum of a web. To get rid of warts, some lie in afootpath with the face upwards, when the moon is twenty daysold at least, and after fixing their gaze upon it, extend theirarms above the head, and rub themselves with anythingwithin their reach. If a person is extracting a corn at themoment that a star shoots, he will experience an immediatecure,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> they say. By pouring vinegar upon the hinges of adoor, a thick liniment is formed, which, applied to the forehead, will alleviate headache: an effect equally produced, weare told, by binding the temples with a halter with which aman has been hanged. When a fish-bone happens to stick inthe throat, it will go down immediately, if the person plungeshis feet into cold water; but where the accident has happenedwith any other kind of bone, the proper remedy is to applyto the head some fragments of bones taken from the same dish.In cases where bread has stuck in the throat, the best plan isto take some of the same bread, and insert it in both ears.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Of which the Persian Magi were the most noted professors.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The "constat" here, whether it belongs to the magicians, or to Plinyhimself, is highly amusing, as Ajasson remarks.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Sillig appears to be right in his conjecture that the "vel" hereshould be omitted.</p></body>
