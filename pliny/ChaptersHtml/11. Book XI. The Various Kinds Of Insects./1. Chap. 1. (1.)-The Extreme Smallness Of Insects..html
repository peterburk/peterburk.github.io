<div2 type="chapter" n="1" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 1. (1.)—THE EXTREME SMALLNESS OF INSECTS.</head><p>WE shall now proceed to a description of the insects, asubject replete with endless difficulties;<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> for, in fact, thereare some authors who have maintained that they do not respire,and that they are destitute of blood. The insects are numerous,and form many species, and their mode of life is like that ofthe terrestrial animals and the birds. Some of them are furnished with wings, bees for instance; others are divided intothose kinds which have wings, and those which are withoutthem, such as ants; while others, again, are destitute of bothwings and feet. All these animals have been very properlycalled "insects,"<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> from the incisures or divisions which separate the body, sometimes at the neck, and sometimes at thecorselet, and so divide it into members or segments, onlyunited to each other by a slender tube. In some insects, however, this division is not complete, as it is surrounded bywrinkled folds; and thus the flexible vertebræ of the creature,whether situate at the abdomen, or whether only at the upperpart of the body, are protected by layers, overlapping eachother; indeed, in no one of her works has Nature more fullydisplayed her exhaustless ingenuity.</p><p>(2.) In large animals, on the other hand, or, at all events,<pb n="3002" />in the very largest among them, she found her task easy andher materials ready and pliable; but in these minute creatures,so nearly akin as they are to non-entity, how surpassing theintelligence, how vast the resources, and how ineffable theperfection which she has displayed. Where is it that she hasunited so many senses as in the gnat?—not to speak of creaturesthat might be mentioned of still smaller size—Where, I say,has she found room to place in it the organs of sight? Wherehas she centred the sense of taste? Where has she insertedthe power of smell? And where, too, has she implanted thatsharp shrill voice of the creature, so utterly disproportioned tothe smallness of its body? With what astonishing subtletyhas she united the wings to the trunk, elongated the jointsof the legs, framed that long, craving concavity for a belly, andthen inflamed the animal with an insatiate thirst for blood,that of man more especially! What ingenuity has she displayedin providing it with a sting,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> so well adapted for piercing theskin! And then too, just as though she had had the mostextensive field for the exercise of her skill, although theweapon is so minute that it can hardly be seen, she has formedit with a twofold mechanism, providing it with a point for thepurpose of piercing, and at the same moment making it hollow,to adapt it for suction.</p><p>What teeth, too, has she inserted in the teredo,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> to adapt itfor piercing oak even with a sound which fully attests theirdestructive power! while at the same time she has made woodits principal nutriment. We give all our admiration to theshoulders of the elephant as it supports the turret, to thestalwart neck of the bull, and the might with which it hurlsaloft whatever comes in its way, to the onslaught of the tiger,or to the mane of the lion; while, at the same time, Nature isnowhere to be seen to greater perfection than in the verysmallest of her works. For this reason then, I must beg ofmy readers, notwithstanding the contempt they feel for manyof these objects, not to feel a similar disdain for the information I am about to give relative thereto, seeing that, in the<pb n="3003" />study of Nature, there are none of her works that are unworthyof our consideration.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Immensæ subtilitatis." As Cuvier remarks, the ancients have committed more errors in reference to the insects, than to any other portion ofthe animal world. The discovery of the microscope has served more thananything to correct these erroneous notions.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Insecta," "articulated."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The trunk of the gnat, Cuvier says, contains five silken and pointedthreads, which together have the effect of a sting.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Teredo navalis of Linnæus, not an insect, but one of the mollusks.This is the same creature that is mentioned in B. xvi. c. 80; but that spokenof in B. viii. c. 74, must have been a land insect.</p></body>
