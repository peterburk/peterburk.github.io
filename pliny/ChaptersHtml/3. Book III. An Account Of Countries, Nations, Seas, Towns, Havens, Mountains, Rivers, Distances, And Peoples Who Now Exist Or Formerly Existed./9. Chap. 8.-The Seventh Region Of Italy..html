At an early period the Umbri were expelled from itby the Pelasgi; and these again by the Lydians,who from a king of theirs<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> were named Tyrrheni, butafterwards, from the rites observed in their sacrifices, were called,in the Greek language<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>, Tusci. The first town in Etruria isLuna<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>, with a noble harbour, then the colony of Luca<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>,at some distance from the sea, and nearer to it again thecolony of Pis¾<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>, between the rivers Auser<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> andArnus<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>, whichowes its origin to Pelops and the Pisans<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>, or else to theTeutani, a people of Greece. Next is Vada<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> Volaterrana, thenthe river Cecinna<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>, and Populonium<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> formerly belongingto the Etrurians, the only town they had on this coast.Next to these is the river Prile<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>, then the Umbro<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>, which isnavigable, and where the district of Umbria begins, the portof Telamon<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>, Cosa<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> of the Volcientes, founded by the Roman<pb n="1188" />people, Gravisc¾<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span>, Castrum novum<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span>, Pyrgi<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span>, theriver C¾retanus<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span>, and C¾re<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> itself, four milesinland, called Agylla bythe Pelasgi who founded it, Alsium<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span>, Fregen¾<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span>, andthe riverTiber, 284<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span> miles from the Macra.</p><p>In the interior we have the colonies of Falisci<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span>, founded bythe Argives, according to the account of Cato<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span>, and surnamedFalisci Etruscorum, Lucus Feroni¾<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span>, Rusellana, theSenienses<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span>, and Sutrina<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span>.

B. iv.c. 55, and Velleius Paterculus, B. i. c. 1. These writers all agree as to thefact of the migration of a colony of Lydians under the conduct ofTyrrhenus to the part of Italy afterwards called Etruria. Thissubject however, as well as the migrations of the Pelasgi, isinvolved in the greatest obscurity.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From the Greek verb <foreign lang="greek">qu/ein</foreign> "to sacrifice," heimplies:Ñfrom theircustom of frequently sacrificing, says Servius, on the Xth Book ofthe ®neid. Dionysius of Halicarnassus says that they were from theirfrequent sacrifices called <foreign lang="greek">quo/skooi.</foreign> These areprobably fanciful derivations; but there is no doubt that the peopleof Etruria were for severalcenturies the instructors of the Romans in the arts of sacrifice, augury,and divination.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The ruins of Luna, which was destroyed by the Normans in themiddle ages, are still visible on the banks of the Magra. The modernname of the port is Golfo della Spezzia.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The modern city of Lucca has its site and name.ÑLivy, B. xli. c. 13,informs us that this colony was founded in the year of the city 576, duringthe Consulship of Claudius Pulcher and Sempronius Gracchus.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The modern city of Pisa.

It entered the Tyrrhenian sea, near theport of Vada Volaterrana just mentioned.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The present Piombino is supposed to have arisen from the ruins ofthis place.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now the Bruno.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The modern Ombrone.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now known as Telamone Vecchio.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There are ruins near lake Orbitello, which bear the name of Cosa:Ansedonia was said to have risen from its ruins, and in its turn fallen todecay.</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Two localities have been mentioned as the site of Gravisc¾, at bothof which there are ancient remains: one on the right bank of the Marta,about a mile from its mouth, and the other on the sea-coast at a spotcalled Santo Clementino or Le Saline, a mile south of the mouth of theMarta. Probably the latter are the remains of Gravisc¾, althoughDennis (Etruria, i. pp. 387Ð395) inclines to be in favour of theformer.</p><p><span id="note_17"><a href="#ref_17">17. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The modern Torre Chiaruccia, five miles south of Civita Vecchia.</p><p><span id="note_18"><a href="#ref_18">18. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The modern Torre di Santa Severa.</p><p><span id="note_19"><a href="#ref_19">19. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now the Vaccina.</p><p><span id="note_20"><a href="#ref_20">20. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The remains of this once powerful city are marked by the village ofCervetri or Old C¾re. According to Strabo it received its name fromthe Greek word <foreign lang="greek">xai=re</foreign> "hail!" with which the inhabitants saluted theTyrrhenian or Lydian invaders. It was to this place that the Romanssent their most precious sacred relics when their city was taken by theGauls. Its most interesting remains are the sepulchres, of which anaccount is given in Dennis's Etruria.</p><p><span id="note_21"><a href="#ref_21">21. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Its remains are to be seen in the vicinity of the modernvillage of Palo.</p><p><span id="note_22"><a href="#ref_22">22. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Its site is supposed to have been at the spot now called the Torre diMaccarese, midway between Palo and Porto, and at the mouth of theriver Arone. Its situation was marshy and unhealthy.</p><p><span id="note_23"><a href="#ref_23">23. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This exceeds the real distance, which is about 230 miles.</p><p><span id="note_24"><a href="#ref_24">24. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The site of the Etruscan Falerii or Falisci is probably occupied by thepresent Civita Castellana; while that of the Roman city of the samename, at a distance of four miles, is marked by a single house and the ruinsof a church, called Santa Maria di Falleri. The ancient city wascaptured by the Romans under Camillus.</p><p><span id="note_25"><a href="#ref_25">25. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In his book of "Origines," which is now lost.</p><p><span id="note_26"><a href="#ref_26">26. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"The Grove of Feronia." The town was so called from the groveof that Sabine goddess there situate. In the early times of Rome therewas a great resort to this spot not only for religious purposes, but forthose of trade as well. Its traces are still to be seen at the village of SaintOrestes, near the south-east extremity of the hill there, which is still calledFelonica. This is in southern Etruria, but Ptolemy mentions anotherplace of the same name in the north-west extremity of Etruria, betweenthe Arnus and the Macra.</p><p><span id="note_27"><a href="#ref_27">27. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The people of the spot now called Siena, in Tuscany.</p><p><span id="note_28"><a href="#ref_28">28. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Sutri, on the river Pozollo.</p><p><span id="note_29"><a href="#ref_29">29. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The people of Arretium, one of the most powerful cities of Etruria.The three tribes or peoples here mentioned probably did not occupy distinct towns, but constituted separate communities or municipal bodies,being distinct colonies or bodies of settlers. The Julienses were thecolonists settled there by Augustus. The Fidentes had probably settledat an earlier period. The modern Arezzo has risen on the remains of theRoman city, while the remains of the Etruscan city are pointed out onan elevated spot called Poggio di San Cornellio, two or three miles southeast of Arezzo. Many valuable relics of antiquity have been discoveredhere. The family of M¾cenas sprang from this place.</p><p><span id="note_30"><a href="#ref_30">30. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The people of Aqu¾ Tauri, a watering-place of Etruria, situate aboutthree miles north of the present Civita Vecchia, and now called Bagni diFerrata. The baths are described by Rutilius in his Itinerary, who callsthem Tauri Therm¾ (the Bull's Baths), and ascribes their name to thefact of their having been accidentally discovered by a bull.</p><p><span id="note_31"><a href="#ref_31">31. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The people of Blera, on the site of the modern village of Bieda, abouttwelve miles south of Viterbo. Numerous remains of Etruscan antiquityhave been found here.ÑSee Dennis's Etruria, vol. i. pp. 260Ð272.</p><p><span id="note_32"><a href="#ref_32">32. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The people of Cortona, a powerful city of Etruria, which is stillknown by the same name. It was probably in the number of the citiesof Etruria that were ravaged by Sylla, and then recolonized by him.Numerous remains of Etruscan antiquity have been discovered there.</p><p><span id="note_33"><a href="#ref_33">33. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The people of Capena, an ancient and important city of Etruria,which, after long opposing the inroads of the Romans, was reduced tosubmission shortly after the fall of Veii, B.C. <date value="-393" authname="-393">393</date>. It existed and heldmunicipal rank till the time of the Emperor Aurelian, after which alltraces of its name or existence were lost, till <date value="1750" authname="1750">1750</date>, when Galetti fixed itssite with great accuracy at Civitucola or San Martino, about 24 milesfrom Rome. It was situate on the banks of a small river now called theGrammiccia, and in its territory was the celebrated 'Lucus Feronin¾' previously mentioned.</p><p><span id="note_34"><a href="#ref_34">34. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The new and old colonists of the city of Clusium, who probably enjoyed distinct municipal rights. The modern Chiusi stands on its site.</p><p><span id="note_35"><a href="#ref_35">35. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The modern Fiorenze or Florence occupies the site of their city.</p><p><span id="note_36"><a href="#ref_36">36. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The village of Fiesole stands on its site. Extensive remains of theancient city are still to be found.</p><p><span id="note_37"><a href="#ref_37">37. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The site of Ferentinum is now uninhabited, but is still known by thename of Ferento. The rivers of the ancient city are very considerable;it was finally destroyed by the people of Viterbo in the 12th century.</p><p><span id="note_38"><a href="#ref_38">38. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">An ancient town of Etruria near Falisci. Cluver thinks that it wassituate at Gallese, a village nine miles north of Civita Castellana; butDennis considers its site to have been between Borghetto on the Tiberand Corchiano, where there are considerable remains of an Etruscan city.The spot is named San Silvestro, from a ruined church there.</p><p><span id="note_39"><a href="#ref_39">39. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or Horta; the spot now called Orte, where numerous Etruscan remains are found; it probably derived its name from the Etruscan goddess Horta. Hortanum, the name given to it by Pliny, is perhaps anadjective form of the name, "oppidun" being understood.</p><p><span id="note_40"><a href="#ref_40">40. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Possibly the same as 'Urbs Vetus,' on the side of which the presentOrvieto stands.</p><p><span id="note_41"><a href="#ref_41">41. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Nepi, near the river Pozzolo.</p><p><span id="note_42"><a href="#ref_42">42. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">According to Hardouin the site of the Novem Pagi, or nine Boroughs,is occupied by the modern Il Mignone, near Civita Vecchia.</p><p><span id="note_43"><a href="#ref_43">43. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Its site is generally supposed to have been at Oriuolo, about five milesnorth of Bracciano; but Dennis informs us that there are no ancientremains at that place. Being a pr¾fecture it may have consisted of onlya number of little villages, united in one jurisdiction.</p><p><span id="note_44"><a href="#ref_44">44. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The modern Pistoia stands on its site.</p><p><span id="note_45"><a href="#ref_45">45. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Perugia.</p><p><span id="note_46"><a href="#ref_46">46. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Supposed by Hardouin to have inhabited the site of the modernSovretto.</p><p><span id="note_47"><a href="#ref_47">47. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably situate in the modern duchy of Castro.</p><p><span id="note_48"><a href="#ref_48">48. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The people of Tarquinii near Rome, the head of the Etruscan confederation. It was here that Demaratus the Corinthian, the father ofTarquinius Priscus, settled. It was deserted by its inhabitants in theeighth or ninth century, who founded the town of Corneto on a hillopposite to it. The ruins are known as Turchina, a corruption of theancient name.</p><p><span id="note_49"><a href="#ref_49">49. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The site of their town is probably marked by the modern Toscanella.</p><p><span id="note_50"><a href="#ref_50">50. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The ruins of their town still retain somewhat of their ancient namein that of "Vetulia."</p><p><span id="note_51"><a href="#ref_51">51. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The people of the powerful city of Veii, subdued by Camillus. Itsruins have been discovered in the vicinity of the village of Isola Farnese.</p><p><span id="note_52"><a href="#ref_52">52. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Their town stood on the site of the present Bisontia.</p><p><span id="note_53"><a href="#ref_53">53. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The people of Volaterr¾, the present Volterra, one of the twelve citiesof the Etruscan Confederation. It was for a time the residence of thekings of Lombardy. The modern town covers only a small portion ofthe area of the ancient city, of which there are some interesting remains.</p><p><span id="note_54"><a href="#ref_54">54. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The people of Volci or Vulci, of which the ruins bear the same name.Its sepulchres have produced vast treasures of ancient art.</p><p><span id="note_55"><a href="#ref_55">55. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The people of Volsinii or Vulsinii, now called Bolsena. This wasone of the most ancient and powerful of the twelve cities of the Etruscanconfederation. On their subjugation by the Romans the Etruscan citywas destroyed, and its inhabitants were compelled to settle on a less defensible site. The new city was the birth-place of Sejanus, the worthlessfavourite of Tiberius. Of the ancient city there are scarcely any remains.</p><p><span id="note_56"><a href="#ref_56">56. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Called also Crustumeria, Crustumium, and Crustuminium. It wasa city of Latium on the borders of the Sabine country, and was subduedby Romulus, though it afterwards appears as independent in the time ofTarquinius Priscus. The territory was noted for its fertility. The exactsite of the city is unknown; a place called Marcigliana Vecchia, aboutnine miles from Rome, seems the most probable.</p><p><span id="note_57"><a href="#ref_57">57. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The site of Caletra is quite unknown. It was situate at some pointin the present valley of the Albegna.</p></body>
