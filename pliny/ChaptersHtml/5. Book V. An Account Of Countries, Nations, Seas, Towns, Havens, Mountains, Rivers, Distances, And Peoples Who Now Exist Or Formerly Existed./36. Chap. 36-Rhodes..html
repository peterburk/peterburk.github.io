<div2 type="chapter" n="36" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 36—RHODES.</head><p>But the fairest of them all is the free island of Rhodes,125, or, if we would rather believe Isidorus, 103 miles incircumference. It contains the inhabited cities of Lindos,Camirus<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>, and Ialysus<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>, now called Rhodos. It is distantfrom Alexandria in Egypt, according to Isidorus, 583 miles;but, according to Eratosthenes, 469. Mucianus says, thatits distance from Cyprus is 166. This island was formerlycalled Ophiussa<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>, Asteria<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, Æthria<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>,Trinacrie<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>, Corymbia<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>,Pœeëssa<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>, Atabyria<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>, from the name of one of itskings; and,in later times, Macaria<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> and Oloessa<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>. The islands of theRhodians are Carpathus<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>, which has given its name to the<pb n="1484" />surrounding sea; Casos<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>, formerly known as Achne<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>;Nisyros<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>, twelve miles distant from Cnidos, and formerlycalled Porphyris<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span>; and, in the same vicinity, midway betweenRhodes and Cnidos, Syme<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span>. This island is thirty-seven milesand a half in circumference, and welcomes us with eight fineharbours. Besides these islands, there are, in the vicinityof Rhodes, those of Cyclopis, Teganon, Cordylussa<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span>, thefour islands called Diabetæ<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span>, Hymos, Chalce<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span>, with its cityof that name, Sentlussa<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span>, Narthecussa<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span>, Dimastos, Progne;and, off Cnidos, Cisserussa, Therionarce, and Calydne<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span>, withthe three towns of Notium, Nisyros, and Mendeterus. InArconnesus<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span> there is the town of Ceramus. Off the coastof Caria, there are the islands known as the Argiæ, twentyin number; also Hyetussa<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span>, Lepsia, and Leros.</p><p>The most noted island, however, in this gulf is that ofCos<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span>, fifteen miles distant from Halicarnassus, and 100 incircumference, according to the opinion of many writers.It was formerly called Merope; according to Staphylus, Cea;<pb n="1485" />Meropis, as Dionysius tells us; and, after that, Nymphæa.In this island there is Mount Prion. Nisyros<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span>, formerlycalled Porphyris, is supposed to have been severed from theisland of Cos. We next come to the island of Caryanda<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span>,with a city of that name, and that of Pidosus<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span>, not farfrom Halicarnassus. In the Gulf of Ceramicus we also findPriaponnesos<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span>, Hipponnesos, Psyra, Mya, Lampsa. Æmyndus,Passala, Crusa, Pinnicussa, Sepiussa<span id="ref_31"><a href="#note_31">[31]</a></span>, and Melano. At ashort distance from the mainland is an island which bearsthe name of Cinædopolis, from the circumstance that KingAlexander left behind there certain persons of a mostdisgraceful character.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Still known as Lindo and Camiro, according to D'Anville.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">One of the three ancient Doric cities of Rhodes. It lay three-quartersof a mile to the south-west of the city of Rhodes, with which Plinyseems here to confound it.

It isprobable that there was a town on the mainland and another in theisland of the same name. Leake says, that there can be little doubt thatthe large peninsula, towards the west end of which is the fine harbourcalled by the Turks Pasha Limani, is the ancient island of Caryanda, nowjoined to the mainland by a narrow sandy isthmus.</p><p><span id="note_29"><a href="#ref_29">29. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The island of Hyali, near the harbour of Meffi, on the coast ofCaria, according to Dupinet.</p><p><span id="note_30"><a href="#ref_30">30. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably so called from the worship of the god Priapus there.</p><p><span id="note_31"><a href="#ref_31">31. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Few, if any, of these islets can now be recognized.
