This kind of stoneworkis what they call "isodomon,"<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> it being "pseudisodomon"<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>when the wall is built of materials of unequal dimensions.A third kind of stonework is called "emplecton,"<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> the twoexteriors only being made with regularity, the rest of thematerial being thrown in at random. It is necessary thatthe stones should lie over one another alternately, in such away that the middle of one stone meets the point of junctionof the two below it; and this, too, in the middle of the wall,if possible; but if not, at all events, at the sides. When themiddle of the wall is filled up with broken stones, the workis known as "diatoichon."<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span><pb n="6373" /></p><p>The reticulated<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> kind of building, which is mostly in useat Rome, is very liable to crack.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> All building should bedone by line and rule, and ought to be strictly on the perpendicular.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Built of stones of equal size."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Built of stones of unequal sizes."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Filled up work," apparently.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The reading is very doubtful here for the word seems to mean, inGreek, "From one wall to another."
