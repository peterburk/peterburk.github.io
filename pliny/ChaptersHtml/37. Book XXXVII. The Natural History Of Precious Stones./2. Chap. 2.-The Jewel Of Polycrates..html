It so happened, however, that a fish of remarkablesize, one destined for the table of a king, swallowedthe jewel, as it would have done a bait; and then, to completethe portentous omen, restored it again to the owner in theroyal kitchen, by the ruling hand of a treacherous<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> fortune.</p><p>The stone in this ring, it is generally agreed, was a sardonyx,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>and they still show one at Rome, which, if we believe thestory, was this identical stone. It is enclosed in a horn of gold,and was deposited, by the Emperor Augustus, in the Templeof Concord, where it holds pretty nearly the lowest rank amonga multitude of other jewels that are preferable to it.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxxiii. c. 6.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">For ultimately, Oroetes, the satrap of Sardes, contrived to allure himinto his power, and had him crucified, B.C. <date value="-522" authname="-522">522</date>. Fuller, in his <hi rend="ital">Worthies,</hi>p. 370, tells a very similar story of the loss and recovery of his ring byone Anderson, a merchant of Newcastle-on-Tyne; and Zuinglius gives asimilar statement with reference to Arnulph, duke of Lorraine, who droppedhis ring into the Moselle, and recovered it from the belly of a fish.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See Chapter 23. According to Herodotus, Pausanias, Dionysius ofHalicarnassus, and Suidas, the stone was an emerald; and Lessing thinksthat there was no figure engraved on it. See Chapter 4 of this Book.Without vouching for the truth of it, we give the following extract fromthe <hi rend="ital">London Journal,</hi> Vol. xxiii. No. 592. "A vine-dresser of Albano,near Rome, is said to have found in a vineyard, the celebrated ring ofPolycrates.ÑThe stone is of considerable size, and oblong in form. Theengraving on it, by Theodore of Samos, the son of Talikles, is of extraordinaryfineness and beauty. It represents a lyre, with three bees flyingabout; below, on the right, a dolphin; on the left, the head of a bull.The name of the engraver is inscribed in Greek characters. The uppersurface of the stone is slightly concave, not highly polished, and onecorner broken. It is asserted that the possessor has been offered 50,000dollars for it."</p></body>
