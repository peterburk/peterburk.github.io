(8.)—THESSALY PROPER.</head><p>In Thessaly is Orchomenus, formerly called the Minyan<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>,and the towns of Almon, by some called Salmon, Atrax<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>,and Pelinna; the Fountain of Hyperia; the towns also ofPheræ<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>, at the back of which is Pieria<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, extendingto Macedonia, Larisa<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>, Gomphi<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>,Thebes<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> of Thessaly, the groveof Pteleon, the Gulf of Pagasa, the town of Pagasa<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>, whichwas afterwards called Demetrias<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>, the Plains of Pharsalia,<pb n="1295" />with a free city of similar name<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>, Crannon<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>, and Iletia.The mountains of Phthiotis are Nymphæus, once so beautiful for itsgarden scenery, the work of nature; Busygæus,Donacesa, Bermius<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>, Daphusa, Chimerion, Athamas, andStephane. In Thessaly there are thirty-four, of which themost famous are Cercetii, Olympus<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>, Pierus, and Ossa, oppositeto which last are Pindus and Othrys, the abodes of theLapithæ. These mountains look towards the west, Pelion<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>towards the east, all of them forming a curve like an amphitheatre,in the interior of which, lying before them, are noless than seventy-five cities. The rivers of Thessaly are theApidanus<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>, the Phœnix<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span>, the Enipeus<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span>, theOnochonus<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span>, andthe Pamisus. There is also the Fountain of Messeis, andthe lake Bœbeis<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span>. The river Peneus<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> too, superior to allothers in celebrity, takes its rise near Gomphi, and flowsdown a well-wooded valley between Ossa and Olympus, a<pb n="1296" />distance of five hundred stadia, being navigable half thatdistance. The vale, for a distance of five miles through whichthis river runs, is called by the name of Tempe; being ajugerum<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> and a half nearly in breadth, while on the rightand left, the mountain chain slopes away with a gentleelevation, beyond the range of human vision, the foliageimparting its colour to the light within. Along this valeglides the Peneus, reflecting the green tints as it rolls alongits pebbly bed, its banks covered with tufts of verdantherbage, and enlivened by the melodious warblings of thebirds. The Peneus receives the river Orcus, or rather, Ishould say, does not receive it, but merely carries its waters,which swim on its surface like oil, as Homer says<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span>; and then,after a short time, rejects them, refusing to allow the watersof a river devoted to penal sufferings and engendered forthe Furies to mingle with his silvery streams.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">So called from the people called Minyæ, who derived their namefrom Minyas, the father of Orchomenus.

It is now called by the Greeks Elymbo, and by theTurks Semavat-Evi, the "Abode of the Celestials." A portion of this rangewas called Pierus; and Ossa, now Kissavo, the "ivy-clad," was dividedfrom Olympus on the N.W. by the Vale of Tempe. Othrys extendedfrom the south of Mount Pindus, to the eastern coast and the Promontory between the Gulf of Pagasa and the northern point of Eubœa.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called Plessedhi or Zagora; situate in the district of Magnesiain Thessaly, between lake Bœbeis and the Pagasæan Gulf.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now the Gouropotamo.</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Flowing into the Asopus near Thermopylæ.</p><p><span id="note_17"><a href="#ref_17">17. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In Pieria.
