(23.)â€”CISTERNS.</head><p>Cisterns should be made of five parts of pure, gravelly, sand,two of the very strongest quicklime, and fragments of silexnot exceeding a pound each in weight; when thus incorporated,the bottom and sides should be well beaten with ironrammers. The best plan, too, is to have the cisterns double;so that all superfluities may settle in the inner cistern, andthe water filter through, as pure as possible, into the outerone.</p></div2></body>
