Here, after passingPhocæa, we come to the Ascanian Port, then the spot whereLarissa<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> stood, and then Cyme<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>, Myrina, also called Sebastopolis<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>,and in the interior, Ægæ<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>, Attalia<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>, Posidea, Neon-<pb n="1473" />tichos<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>, and Temnos<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>. Upon the shore we come to the riverTitanus, and the city which from it derives its name. Grynia<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>also stood here on an island reclaimed from the sea and joinedto the land: now only its harbours are left<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>. We then cometo the town of Elæa<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>, the river Caïcus<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>, which flows fromMysia, the town of Pitane<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>, and the river Canaïus. The followingtowns no longer exist—Canæ<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>, Lysimachia<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>, Atarnea<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span>,Carene<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span>, Cisthene<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span>, Cilla<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span>, Cocylium<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span>, Theba<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span>, Astyre<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span>,<pb n="1474" />Chrysa<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span>, Palæscepsis<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span>, Gergitha<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span>, and Neandros<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span>. Wethen come to the city of Perperene<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span>, which still survives,the district of Heracleotes, the town of Coryphas<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span>, therivers Grylios and Ollius, the region of Aphrodisias<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span>,which formerly had the name of Politice Orgas, the districtof Scepsis<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span>, and the river Evenus<span id="ref_31"><a href="#note_31">[31]</a></span>, on whose banksthe towns of Lyrnesos<span id="ref_32"><a href="#note_32">[32]</a></span> and Miletos have fallen to decay.In this district also is Mount Ida<span id="ref_33"><a href="#note_33">[33]</a></span>, and on the coast Adramytteos<span id="ref_34"><a href="#note_34">[34]</a></span>,formerly called Pedasus, which gives its name tothe gulf and the jurisdiction so called. The other rivers arethe Astron, Cormalos, Crianos, Alabastros, and Hieros, flowingfrom Mount Ida: in the interior is Mount Gargara<span id="ref_35"><a href="#note_35">[35]</a></span>,<pb n="1475" />with a town of the same name. Again, on the coast wemeet with Antandros<span id="ref_36"><a href="#note_36">[36]</a></span>, formerly called Edonis, and afterthat Cimmeris and Assos, also called Apollonia. The townof Palamedium also formerly stood here. The Promontoryof Lecton<span id="ref_37"><a href="#note_37">[37]</a></span> separates Æolis from Troas. In Æolis therewas formerly the city of Polymedia, as also Chrysa, and asecond Larissa. The temple of Smintheus<span id="ref_38"><a href="#note_38">[38]</a></span> is still standing;Colone<span id="ref_39"><a href="#note_39">[39]</a></span> in the interior has perished.

It was called Egyptian Larissa, because Cyrus the Great settled here a body of his Egyptian soldiers. According to D'Anville its site is still known as Larusar.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Said to have been so called from Cyme an Amazon. It was on the northern, side of the Hermus: Herodotus gives it the surname of Phriconis. Its site is supposed to be at the modern Sanderli or Sandarlio. The father of the poet Hesiod was a native of this place.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It was probably so called in honour of the Emperor Augustus.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Situate at a short distance from the coast. We learn from Tacitus that it suffered from the great earthquake in the time of Tiberius. Its site is called Guzel-Hissar, according to D'Anville.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Originally named Agroeira or Alloeira.

Strabo speaks of it as distant thirty stadia from Larissa.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Its site is unknown; but it must not be confounded with the place of that name mentioned in the last Chapter, which stood on the sea-coast.

It is again mentioned by Pliny in B. xxxii. c. 21.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This passage seems to be in a corrupt state, and it is difficult to arrive at Pliny's exact meaning.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The port of the Pergameni. Strabo places it south of the river Caïcus, twelve stadia from that river, and 120 from Pergamum. Its site is uncertain, but Leake fixes it at a place called Kliseli, on the road from the south to Pergamum.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Its modern name is said to be Ak-Su or Bakir.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">On the coast of the Elaitic gulf. It was almost destroyed by an earthquake in the reign of the Emperor Titus. Its site is by some thought to have been at Sanderli.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Supposed to have been situate near the modern Cape Coloni. It was here that in the war with Antiochus, B.C. <date value="-191" authname="-191">191</date>–190, the Roman fleet was hauled up for the winter and protected by a ditch or rampart.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">So called from Lysimachus, the son of Agathocles.</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A strong place opposite to Lesbos.

It was a place with an acropolis and strong walls. Attalus, king of Pergamus, transplanted the people of Gergis to another spot near the sources of the Caïcus, whence we afterwards find a place called Gergetha or Gergithion, in the vicinity of Larissa. The old town of Gergis was by some said to have been the birth-place of the Sibyl, and its coins have her image impressed on them.</p><p><span id="note_26"><a href="#ref_26">26. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Also called Neandria, upon the Hellespont.</p><p><span id="note_27"><a href="#ref_27">27. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">South of Adramyttium; in its vicinity were copper-mines and celebrated vineyards.

Scepsis was an ancient city in the interior of the Troad, south-east of Alexandria, in the mountains of Ida. Its inhabitants were removed by Antigonus to Alexandria; but being permitted by Lysimachus to return to their homes, they built a new city, and the remains of the old town were then called Palæscepsis. This place is famous in literary history for being the spot where certain MSS. of Aristotle and Theophrastus were buried to prevent their transfer to Pergamus. When dug up they were found nearly destroyed by mould, and in this condition were removed by Sylla to Athens.</p><p><span id="note_31"><a href="#ref_31">31. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Sometimes called the Lycormas, now known as the Fidhari or Fidharo.</p><p><span id="note_32"><a href="#ref_32">32. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Frequently mentioned by Homer.</p><p><span id="note_33"><a href="#ref_33">33. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Still known as Ida or Kas-Dagh.</p><p><span id="note_34"><a href="#ref_34">34. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">More generally known as Adramyttium or Adramyteum, now Adramiti or Edremit.

This appears to have been situate at the Chrysa last mentioned by Pliny as no longer in existence. Strabo places Chrysa on a hill, and he mentions the temple of Smintheus and speaks of a symbol which recorded the etymon of that name, the mouse which lay at the foot of the wooden figure, the work of Scopas. According to an ancient tradition, Apollo had his name of Smintheus given him as being the mouse-destroyer, for, according to Apion, the meaning of Smintheus was a "mouse."</p><p><span id="note_39"><a href="#ref_39">39. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">According to tradition this place was in early times the residence of Cycnus, a Thracian prince, who possessed the adjoining country, and the island of Tenedos, opposite to which Colone was situate on the mainland.
