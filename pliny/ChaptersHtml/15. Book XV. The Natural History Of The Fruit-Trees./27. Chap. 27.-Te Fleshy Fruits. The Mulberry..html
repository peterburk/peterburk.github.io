The flesh of the various berries,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> of the mulberry, and of the arbute, are quite different from one another—and then what a difference, too,between the grape, which is only skin and juice,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> the myxaplum, and the flesh of some berries,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> such as the olive, for<pb n="3320" />instance! In the flesh of the mulberry there is a juice of avinous flavour, and the fruit assumes three different colours,being at first white, then red, and ripe when black. Themulberry blossoms one of the very last,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and yet is amongthe first to ripen: the juice of the fruit, when ripe, will stainthe hands, but that of the unripe fruit will remove the marks.It is in this tree that human ingenuity has effected the leastImprovement<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> of all; there are no varieties here, no modifications effected by grafting, nor, in fact, any other improvementexcept that the size of the fruit, by careful management, hasbeen increased. At Rome, there is a distinction made betweenthe mulberries of Ostia and those of Tusculum. A varietygrows also on brambles, but the flesh of the fruit is of a verydifferent nature.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Acinis."
