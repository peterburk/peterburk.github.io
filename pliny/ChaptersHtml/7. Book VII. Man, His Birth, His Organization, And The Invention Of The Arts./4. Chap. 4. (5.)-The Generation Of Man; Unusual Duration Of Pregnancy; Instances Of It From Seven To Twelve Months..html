<div2 type="chapter" n="4" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 4. (5.)—THE GENERATION OF MAN; UNUSUAL DURATION OF PREGNANCY; INSTANCES OF IT FROM SEVEN TO TWELVE MONTHS.</head><p>In other animals the period of gestation and of birth is fixedand definite, while man, on the other hand, is born at all seasons of the year,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and without any certain period of gestation;<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>for one child is born at the seventh month, another at theeighth, and so on, even to the beginning of the tenth andeleventh. Those children which are born before the seventhmonth are never known to survive;<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> unless, indeed, they hap-<pb n="2140" />pen to have been conceived the day before or the day after thefull moon, or at the change of the moon. In Egypt it is notan uncommon thing for children to be born at the eighthmonth; and in Italy, too, children that are born at thisperiod live just as long as others, notwithstanding the opinionsof the ancients to the contrary. There are great variations inthis respect, which occur in numerous ways. Vestilia, forinstance, who was the wife of C. Herdicius, and was afterwardsmarried, first, to Pomponius,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and then to Orfitus, very eminent citizens, after having brought forth four children, alwaysat the seventh month, had Suillius Rufus at the eleventh month,and then Corbulo at the seventh, both of whom became consuls; after which, at the eighth month, she had Cæsonia,who became the wife of the Emperor Caius.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> As for childrenwho are born at the eighth month, the greatest difficulty withthem is to get them over the first forty days.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> Pregnant women, on the other hand, are in the greatest danger during thefourth and the eighth month, and abortions during these periodsare fatal. Masurius informs us, that L. Papirius, the prætor.on one occasion, when the next but one in succession was urginghis suit at law, decided against him, in favour of the heir,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>although his mother declared that her period of gestation hadlasted thirteen months—upon the ground that it did not appearthat there was any fixed and definite period of gestation.<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span><pb n="2141" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Animals have a certain period for generation, because they are moreimmediately affected by the seasons, whereas, in the human race, the artsof life render these fixed terms unnecessary.—B.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Notwithstanding all the observations of the moderns, the question isscarcely decided respecting the length of time to which pregnancy may beprolonged. Cuvier says, that the experiments of Tessier have shewn, thatthere is a greater latitude in animals than had previously been supposed;he also remarks, that the same animals when domesticated, become lessregular in this respect than in the wild state.—B.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Dalechamps has collected authorities to prove, that a child may survive, when born even at an earlier period; but this, although not absolutely impossible, is improbable in the highest degree.—B.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ajasson expresses himself at a loss to identify this Pomponius; butthinks that it may have been either Julius Pomponius Græcinus, consulA.U.C. 759, or L. Pomponius, consul A.U.C. 794, A.D. <date value="41" authname="41">41</date>.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Caius Caligula. The name of this woman, who was first his mistressand then his wife, was Milonia Cesonia. She was neither handsome noryoung when Caligula first admired her: but was noted for her extreme licentiousness, and at the time when she first became intimate with Caligula,had already had three children. She and her daughter, by him, were putto death on the day on which he was murdered. Corbulo has been mentioned in B. vi. c. 8.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Celsus, B. ii. c. 1, speaks of the fortieth day, as one of the criticalperiods of childhood; the others are the seventh month, the seventh year,and the period of puberty.—B.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Who appears to have urged the great lapse of time that had intervened between the death of the alleged father and the birth of his opponent.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Questions of this nature, of great importance, involving property andtitle, have been the subject of judicial consideration in our times; the longest period to which pregnancy may be protracted seems still not to bedetermined, but the general result has been to shorten it. Aulus Gellius,B. iii. c. 16, has collected the opinions of many of the ancients on thissubject.—B.</p></body>
