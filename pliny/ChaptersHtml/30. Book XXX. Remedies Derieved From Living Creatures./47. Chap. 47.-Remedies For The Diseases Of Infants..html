<div2 type="chapter" n="47" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 47.â€”REMEDIES FOR THE DISEASES OF INFANTS.</head><p>For infants that are troubled with coagulation of the milk,a grand preservative is lamb's rennet, taken in water; and incases where the milk has so coagulated, it may be remediedby administering rennet in vinegar. For the pains incident<pb n="5466" />to dentition, sheep's brains are a very useful remedy. Theinflammation called "siriasis,"<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> to which infants are liable, iscured by attaching to them the bones that are found in thedung of dogs. Hernia in infants is cured by letting a greenlizard bite the child's body while asleep, after which the lizardis attached to a reed, and hung up in the smoke; by the timethe animal dies, the child will be perfectly cured, it is said.The slime of snails, applied to the eyes of children, straightensthe eyelashes, and makes them grow. Ashes of burnt snails,applied with frankincense and juice of white grapes, are a curefor hernia [in infants], if applied for thirty days consecutively.Within the horns<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> of snails, there are certain hard substancesfound, like grits of sand: attached to infants, they facilitatedentition.</p><p>Ashes of empty snail-shells, mixed with wax, are a preventive of procidence of the rectum; but they must be usedin combination with the matter that exudes from a viper'sbrains, on the head being pricked. Vipers' brains, attached tothe infant's body in a piece of skin, facilitate dentition, a similar effect being produced by using the larger teeth of serpents.Ravens' dung, attached to an infant with wool, is curative ofcough.</p><p>It is hardly possible to preserve one's seriousness in describingsome of these remedies, but as they have been transmitted tous, I must not pass them in silence. For the treatment ofhernia in infants, a lizard is recommended; but it must be amale lizard, a thing that may be ascertained by its having butone orifice beneath the tail. The method of proceeding, is forthe lizard to bite the part affected through cloth of gold, clothof silver, and cloth dyed purple; after which it is tied fast in acup that has never been used, and smoked. Incontinence ofurine in infants is checked by giving them boiled mice<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> withtheir food. The large indented horns of the scarabmus, attachedto the bodies of infants, have all the virtues of an amulet. Inthe head of the boa;<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> there is a small stone, they say, whichthe serpent spits out, when it is in fear of death: if the reptileis taken by surprise, and the head cut off, and this stone ex-<pb n="5467" />tracted, it will aid dentition to a marvellous degree, attachedto the neck of infants. The brains, too, of the same serpentare recommended to be attached to the body for a similar purpose, as also the small stone or bone that is found in the backof the slug.</p><p>An admirable promoter of dentition is found in sheep'sbrains, applied to the gums; and equally good for diseases ofthe ears, is an application of goose-grease, with juice of ocimum.Upon prickly plants there is found a kind of rough, hairy,grub: attached to the neck of infants, these insects give instantrelief, it is said, when any of the food has stuck in the throat.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Supposed to be an inflammation of the membranes of the brain.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See c. 8 of this Look.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A remedy still used, Ajasson says, in the French provinces.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. vii. c. 14, and B. xxix. c. 38.</p></body>
