<div2 type="chapter" n="21" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 21—SYRIA UPON THE EUPHRATES.</head><p>Arabia, above mentioned, has the cities of Edessa<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>, formerlycalled Antiochia, and, from the name of its fountain,Callirhoë<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>, and Carrhæ<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>, memorable for the defeat of Crassus<pb n="1444" />there. Adjoining to this is the præfecture of Mesopotamia,which derives its origin from the Assyrians, and in which arethe towns of Anthemusia<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and Nicephorium<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>; after whichcome the Arabians, known by the name of Prætavi, with Singara<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>for their capital. Below Samosata, on the side of Syria,the river Marsyas<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> flows into the Euphrates. At Cingillaends the territory of Commagene, and the state of theImmei begins. The cities which are here washed by theriver are those of Epiphania<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> and Antiochia<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>, generallyknown as Epiphania and Antiochia on the Euphrates; alsoZeugma, seventy-two miles distant from Samosata, famousfor the passage there across the Euphrates. Oppositeto it is Apamia<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>, which Seleucus, the founder of bothcities, united by a bridge. The people who join up toMesopotamia are called the Rhoali. Other towns in Syriaare those of Europus<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>, and what was formerly Thapsa-<pb n="1445" />cus<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>, now Amphipolis. We then come to the ArabianScenitæ<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>. The Euphrates then proceeds in its course tillit reaches the place called Ura<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>, at which, taking a turnto the east, it leaves the Syrian Deserts of Palmyra<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>,which extend as far as the city of Petra<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> and the regionsof Arabia Felix.</p><p>(25.) Palmyra is a city famous for the beauty of its site,the riches of its soil, and the delicious quality and abundanceof its water. Its fields are surrounded by sands on everyside, and are thus separated, as it were, by nature from the restof the world. Though placed between the two great empiresof Rome and Parthia, it still maintains<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> its independence;never failing, at the very first moment that a rupturebetween them is threatened, to attract the careful attentionof both. It is distant 337 miles from Seleucia<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> of theParthians, generally known as Seleucia on the Tigris, 203from the nearest part of the Syrian coast, and twenty-sevenless from Damascus.<pb n="1446" /></p><p>(26.) Below the deserts of Palmyra is the region ofStelendene<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span>, and Hierapolis, Berœa, and Chalcis, alreadymentioned<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span>. Beyond Palmyra, Emesa<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> takes to itself aportion of these deserts; also Elatium, nearer to Petra byone-half than Damascus. At no great distance from Sura<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span>is Philiscum, a town of the Parthians, on the Euphrates.From this place it is ten days' sail to Seleucia, and nearlyas many to Babylon. At a distance of 594 miles beyondZeugma, near the village of Massice, the Euphratesdivides into two channels, the left one of which runs throughMesopotamia, past Seleucia, and falls into the Tigris as itflows around that city. Its channel on the right runs towardsBabylon, the former capital of Chaldæa, and flows throughthe middle of it; and then through another city, the name ofwhich is Otris<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span>, after which it becomes lost in the marshes.Like the Nile, this river increases at stated times, and atmuch about the same period. When the sun has reachedthe twentieth degree of Cancer, it inundates<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span> Mesopotamia;and, after he has passed through Leo and entered Virgo,its waters begin to subside. By the time the sun hasentered the twenty-ninth degree of Virgo, the river has fullyregained its usual height.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In the district of Osrhoëne, in the northern part of Mesopotamia.It was situate on the Syrtus, now the Daisan, a small tributary of theEuphrates. Pliny speaks rather loosely when he places it in Arabia.It is supposed that it bore the name of Antiochia during the reign ofthe Syrian king, Antiochus IV. The modern town of Orfahor Uufah issupposed to represent its site.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"The beautiful stream." It isgenerally supposed that this was another name of Edessa.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Supposed to be the Haran, or Charan, of the Old Testament. Itwas here, as alluded to by Pliny, that Crassus was defeated and slain bythe Parthian general, Surena. It was situate in Osroëne, in Mesopotamia,and not far from Edessa. According to Stephanus, it had itsname from Carrha, a river of Syria, and was celebrated in ancient timesfor its temple of Luna, or Lunus.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">According to Strabo, the Aborras, now the Khabur, flowed round this town. By Tacitus it is called Anthemusias. According to Isidorus of Charax, it lay between Edessa and the Euphrates.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Rakkah, a fortified town of Mesopotamia, on the Euphrates, near the mouth of the river Bilecha. It was built by order of Alexander the Great, and completed probably by Seleucus. It is supposed to have been the same place as Callinicum, the fortifications of which were repaired by Justinian. Its name was changed in later times to Leontopolis by the Emperor Leo.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called Sinjar, according to Brotier. Some writers imagine that this was the site of "the plain in the land of Shinar," on which the Tower of Babel was built, mentioned in the Book of Genesis, xi. 2.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Mentioned in C. 17 of the present Book.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably not that in the district of Cassiotis, and on the western bank of the Orontes, mentioned in C. 19 of the present Book. Of this locality nothing seems to be known, except that Dupinet states that it is now called Adelphe by the Turks.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably the "Antiochia ad Taurum" mentioned by the geographer Stephanus, and by Ptolemy. Some writers place it at the modern Aintab, seventy-five miles north-east of Aleppo.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called Roum-Cala, or the "Roman Castle." For Zeugma see p. 424.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In the north-east of the district of Astropatene, originally called Rhaga. It was rebuilt by Seleucus Nicator, and by him called Europus. Colonel Rawlinson has identified it with the present Veramin, at no great distance from the ancient Rhages.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Its ruins are to be seen at the ford of El Hamman, near the modern Rakkah. It stood on the banks of the Euphrates; and here was the usual, and, for a long time, the only ford of the Euphrates. It is supposed to have derived its name from the Aramean word "Thiphsach," signifying "a ford."</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "Dwellers in Tents." See p. 422.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">According to Ortelius and Hardouin, this is the place called Sura by Pliny, in C. 26 of the present Book; but Parisot differs from that opinion. Bochart suggests, that "Ur, of the Chaldees," is the place referred to under this name; but, as Hardouin observes, that place lay at a considerable distance to the south.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">So called from the circumstance that Palmyra stood in the midst of them. It was built by King Solomon, in an oasis of the Desert, in the midst of palm groves, from which it received its Greek name, which was a translation also of the Hebrew "Tadmor," "the city of palm-trees." It lay at a considerable distance from the Euphrates. Its site presents considerable ruins; but they are all of the Roman period, and greatly inferior to those of Baalbec or Heliopolis.</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The rock fortress of the Idumæans in Arabia Petræa, now called Wady-Musa, half-way between the head of the Gulf of Akabah and the Dead Sea.</p><p><span id="note_17"><a href="#ref_17">17. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Which it continued to do until it was conquered under its queen, Zenobia, by the Emperor Aurelian, in A.D. 270. It was partially destroyed by him, but was afterwards fortified by Justinian; though it never recovered its former greatness.</p><p><span id="note_18"><a href="#ref_18">18. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. vi. c. 30.</p><p><span id="note_19"><a href="#ref_19">19. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny is the only author that makes mention of Stelendene.</p><p><span id="note_20"><a href="#ref_20">20. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In C. 19 of the present Book.</p><p><span id="note_21"><a href="#ref_21">21. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Previously mentioned by Pliny. See p. 439. Of Elatium nothing is known.</p><p><span id="note_22"><a href="#ref_22">22. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The same place that is also mentioned in history as Flavia Firms Sura. The site of Philiscum is totally unknown.</p><p><span id="note_23"><a href="#ref_23">23. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Nothing is known of this place.</p><p><span id="note_24"><a href="#ref_24">24. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Parisot remarks, that it is true that the Euphrates increases periodically, much in the same manner as the Nile; but that its increase does not arise from similar causes, nor are the same results produced by it, seeing that the river does not convey the same volume of water as the Nile, and that the country in the vicinity of its bed does not, like Egypt, form a valley pent up between two ranges of hills.</p></body>
