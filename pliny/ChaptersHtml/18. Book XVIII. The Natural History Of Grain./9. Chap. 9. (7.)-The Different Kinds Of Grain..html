(7.)ÑTHE DIFFERENT KINDS OF GRAIN.</head><p>As the field is now prepared, we shall proceed to speak ofthe nature of the various kinds of grain; we must premise,however, that there are two principal classes of grain, thecereals,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> comprising wheat and barley, and the legumina, suchas the bean and the chick-pea, for instance. The differencebetween these two classes is too well known to require anyfurther description.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This word answers to the Latin "frumenta," which indicates all thosekinds of corn from which bread was prepared by the ancients.</p></body>
