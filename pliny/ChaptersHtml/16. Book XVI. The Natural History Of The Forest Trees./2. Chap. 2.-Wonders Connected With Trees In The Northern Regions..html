Theycover all the rest of Germany, and by their shade augment thecold. But the highest of them all are those not far distantfrom the Chauci already mentioned, and more particularly inthe vicinity of the two lakes<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> there. The very shores are linedwith oaks,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> which manifest an extraordinary eagerness to<pb n="3341" />attain their growth: undermined by the waves or uprooted bythe blasts, with their entwining roots they carry vast forestsalong with them, and, thus balanced, stand upright as they floatalong, while they spread afar their huge branches like therigging of so many ships. Many is the time that these treeshave struck our fleets with alarm, when the waves have driventhem, almost purposely it would seem, against their prows asthey stood at anchor in the night; and the men, destitute ofall remedy and resource, have had to engage in a naval combat with a forest of trees!</p><p>(2.) In the same northern regions, too, is the Hercynian<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>Forest, whose gigantic oaks,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> uninjured by the lapse of ages,and contemporary with the creation of the world, by their nearapproach to immortality surpass all other marvels known. Notto speak of other matters that would surpass all belief, it is awell-known fact that their roots,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> as they meet together, up-heave vast hills; or, if the earth happens not to accumulatewith them, rise aloft to the very branches even, and, as theycontend for the mastery, form arcades, like so many portalsthrown open, and large enough to admit of the passage of asquadron of horse.</p><p>(3.) All these trees, in general, belong to the glandiferousclass,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> and have ever been held in the highest honour by theRoman people.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He alludes to the vicinity of the Zuyder Zee. See B. iv. c. 29. Thespots where these forests once stood are now cultivated plains, covered withvillages and other works of the industry of man.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Quercus." We shall see, in the course of this Book, that its identityhas not been satisfactorily established.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. iv. c. 28, and the Note, Vol. i. p. 348. The village of Hercingen, near Waldsee, is supposed to retain the ancient name.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Robora." It will be seen in this Book that the robur has not beenidentified, any more than the quercus.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Fée treats this story as utterly fabulous. The branches of the FicusIndica grow downwards, and so form arcades certainly; but such is not thecase with any European tree.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Not only oaks, but a variety of other trees, were included under thisname by the ancients; the "glans" embracing not only the acorn, butthe mast of the beech, and the hard fruits of other trees.</p></body>
