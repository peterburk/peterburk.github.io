It is of the greatest consequence that the<pb n="3460" />manure should be laid upon the land while<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> the west windsprevail, and during a dry moon. Most persons, however, misunderstand this precept, and think this should be done whenthe west winds are just beginning to blow, and in the monthof February only: it being really the fact that most cropsrequire manuring in other months as well. At whateverperiod, however, it may be thought proper to manure theland, the greatest care should be taken that the wind is blowing due west at the time, and that the moon is on the wane,and quite dry. Such precautions as these will increase in amost surprising degree the fertilizing effects of manure.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Fée is of opinion, that, with reference to this branch of agriculture,the ancients displayed more skill and intelligence than the moderns.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This absurdity is copied from Varro and Columella.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot"><hi rend="ital">I. e.</hi> in the early part of spring.
