<div2 type="chapter" n="55" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 55.—HOW PEARLS ARE FOUND.</head><p>The fish, as soon as ever it perceives the hand,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> shutsits shell and covers up its treasures, being well aware that it isfor them that it is sought; and if it happens to catch the hand,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>it cuts it off with the sharp edge of the shell. And no punishment is there that could be more justly inflicted. There areother penalties added as well, seeing that the greater part ofthese pearls are only to be found among rocks and crags, whileon the other hand, those which lie out in the main sea are generally accompanied by sea-dogs.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> And yet, for all this, thewomen will not banish these gems from their ears! Somewriters say,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> that these animals live in communities, just likeswarms of bees, each of them being governed by one remarkable for its size and its venerable old age;<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> while at the sametime it is possessed of marvellous skill in taking all due pre-<pb n="2434" />cautions against danger; the divers, they say, take especial careto find these, and when once they are taken, the others stray toand fro, and are easily caught in theirnets. We learn alsothat as soon as they are taken they are placed under a thicklayer of salt in earthen-ware vessels; as the flesh is graduallyconsumed, certain knots,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> which form the pearls, are disengaged<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> from their bodies, and fall to the bottom of thevessel.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Isidorus of Charax, as quoted by Athenæus, B. iii.; and Ælian,Hist. Anim. B. x. c. 20, make similar statements. Rondelet, in his treatiseon Testaceous Fishes, B. i., complains of Pliny using the word "videt,""sees," in the present passage; but, as Hardouin says, he only uses it ina free sense, meaning, "is aware of the approach of," or "has a perceptionof."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Isidorus of Charax, in Athenæus, B. iii., tells a similar story; butmodifies it by saying that the fish sometimes cuts off the <hi rend="ital">fingers</hi> of thedivers, and not the hands.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Canes marini." He calls by this name the same animal that a littlefurther on he describes by the name of "canicula," "dog-fish;" alluding,probably, under that name to various species of the shark. Procopius, inhis book, De Bell. Pers. B. i. c. 4, has a wonderful story in relation to thissubject. He says, that the sea-dogs are wonderful admirers of the pearl-fish, and follow them out to sea; that when the sea-dogs are pressed byhunger, they go in quest of prey, and then return to the shell-fish and gazeupon it. A certain fisherman, having watched for the moment when theshell-fish was deprived of the protection of its attendant sea-dog, whichwas seeking its prey, seized the shell-fish, and made for the shore. Thesea-dog, however, was soon aware of the theft, and making straightfor the fisherman, seized him. Finding himself thus caught, he made alast effort, and threw the pearl-fish on shore, immediately on which he wastorn to pieces by its protector.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Such, for instance, as Megasthenes, quoted by Arrian in his Indica,and Ælian, Hist. Anim. B. xv. c. 8.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hardouin suggests that a preferable reading to "vetuslate," wouldbe "venustate," by its beauty; and indeed, Ælian, in the correspondingpassage, Hist. Anim. B. xv. c. 8, says, that the chief is remarkable "for itssize, and the extreme beauty of its colours."</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Nucleos." The Greek authors occasionally call them "stones"and "bones." Tertullian calls them "maladies of shell-fish and warts"—"concharum vitia et verrucas."</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier says, that the most efficient mode of extracting all the concretions that may happen to be concealed in the body of the animal, is toleave the flesh to dissolve in water, upon which the concretions naturallyfall to the bottom.</p></body>
