<div2 type="chapter" n="50" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 50.—INSTANCES OF THE FRUGALITY OF THE ANCIENTS INREFERENCE TO SILVER PLATE.</head><p>The younger Scipio Africanus left to his heir thirty-twopounds' weight of silver; the same person who, on his triumphover the Carthaginians, displayed four thousand three hundredand seventy pounds' weight of that metal. Such was the sumtotal of the silver possessed by the whole of the inhabitants ofCarthage, that rival of Rome for the empire of the world!How many a Roman since then has surpassed her in his displayof plate for a single table! After the destruction ofNumantia, the same Africanus gave to his soldiers, on theday of his triumph, a largess of seven denarii each—and rightworthy were they of such a general, when satisfied with sucha sum! His brother, Scipio Allobrogicus,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> was the veryfirst who possessed one thousand pounds' weight of silver,<pb n="6133" />but Drusus Livius, when he was tribune of the people, possessedten thousand. As to the fact that an ancient warrior,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> a man,too, who had enjoyed a triumph, should have incurred the noticeof the censor for being in possession of five pounds' weight ofsilver, it is a thing that would appear quite fabulous at thepresent day.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> The same, too, with the instance of CatusÆlius,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> who, when consul, after being found by the Ætolianambassadors taking his morning meal<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> off of common earthenware,refused to receive the silver vessels which they sent him;and, indeed, was never in possession, to the last day of hislife, of any silver at all, with the exception of two drinking-cups,which had been presented to him as the reward of hisvalour, by L. Paulus,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> his father-in-law, on the conquest ofKing Perseus.</p><p>We read, too, that the Carthaginian ambassadors declaredthat no people lived on more amicable terms among themselvesthan the Romans, for that wherever they had dinedthey had always met with the same<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> silver plate. And yet,by Hercules! to my own knowledge, Pompeius Paulinus, sonof a Roman of equestrian rank at Arelate,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> a member, too, ofa family, on the paternal side, that was graced with the fur,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>had with him, when serving with the army, and that, too, ina war against the most savage nations, a service of silver platethat weighed twelve thousand pounds!<pb n="6134" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">So called from his victory over the Allobroges.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In allusion to the case of P. Cornelius Rufinus, the consul, who wasdenounced in the senate by the censors C. Fabricius Luscinus and Q. ÆmiliusRufus, for being in possession of a certain quantity of silver plate.This story is also referred to in B. xviii. c. 8, where <hi rend="ital">ten</hi> pounds is thequantity mentioned.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is said ironically.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Sextus Ælius Pœtus Catus, Consul B.C. <date value="-198" authname="-198">198</date>.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Prandentem."</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">L.

There has been considerable doubt as to the meaningof this, but it is most probable that the "privilege of the fur," or in otherwords, a license to be clad in certain kinds of fur, was conferred on certainmen of rank in the provinces. Holland considers it to be the old participleof "pello," and translates the passage "banished out of the countryand nation where his father was born."</p></body>
