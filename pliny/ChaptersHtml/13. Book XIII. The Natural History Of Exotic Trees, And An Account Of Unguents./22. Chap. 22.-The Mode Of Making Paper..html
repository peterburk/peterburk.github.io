The root lies obliquely,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and is about the<pb n="3187" />thickness of one's arm; the section of the stalk is triangular,and it tapers gracefully upwards towards the extremity,being not more than ten cubits at most in height. Very muchlike a thyrsus<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> in shape, it has a head on the top, which hasno seed<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> in it, and, indeed, is of no use whatever, except as aflower employed to crown the statues of the gods. Thenatives use the roots by way of wood, not only for firing, butfor various other domestic purposes as well. From the papyrus itself they construct boats<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> also, and of the outer coat theymake sails and mats, as well as cloths, besides coverlets andropes; they chew it also, both raw and boiled, though theyswallow the juice only.</p><p>The papyrus grows in Syria also, on the borders of the samelake around which grows the sweet-scented calamus;<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> andKing Antiochus used to employ the productions of that countrysolely as cordage for naval purposes; for the use of spartum<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>had not then become commonly known. More recently it hasbeen understood that a papyrus grows in the river Euphrates,in the vicinity of Babylon, from which a similar kind of papermay easily be produced: still, however, up to the present timethe Parthians have preferred to impress<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> their characters uponcloths</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Brachiali radicis obliqueæ crassitudine.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This was a pole represented as being carried by Bacchus and his Bacchanalian train. It was mostly terminated by the fir cone, that tree beingdedicated to Bacchus, in consequence of the use of its cones and turpentinein making wine. Sometimes it is surmounted by vine or fig leaves, withgrapes or berries arranged in form of a cone.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is not the fact: it has seed in it, though not very easily percep.tible. The description here given is otherwise very correct.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Among the ancients the term papyrus was used as a general appellationfor all the different plants of the genus Cyperus, which was used for makingmats, boats, baskets, and numerous other articles: but one species onlywas employed for making paper, the Cyperus papyrus, or Byblos. Feestates that the papyrus is no longer to be found in the Delta, where it formerly abounded.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xii. c. 48.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Sometimes translated <hi rend="ital">hemp.</hi> A description will be given of it in B.xix. c. 7.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Intexere." This would almost appear to mean that they embroideredor interwove the characters. The Persians still write on a stuff made ofwhite silk, gummed and duly prepared for the purpose.</p></body>
