(20.)—WILLOW-BEDS.</head><p>It now remains to give an account of those trees which areplanted for the sake of others—the vine<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> more particularly—and the wood of which is cut from time to time. Holding thevery first rank among these we find the willow, a tree that isalways planted in a moist soil. The hole, however, should betwo feet and a half in depth, and the slip a foot and a halfonly in length. Willow stakes are also used for the samepurpose, and the stouter they are the better: the distance leftbetween these last should be six feet. When they are threeyears old their growth is checked by cutting them downwithin a couple of feet from the ground, the object being tomake them spread out, so that by the aid of their branchesthey may be cleared without the necessity of using a ladder;for the willow is the more productive the nearer its branchesare to the ground. It is generally recommended to trenchround the willow every year, in the month of April. Suchis the mode of cultivation employed for the osier willow.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span></p><p>The stake willow<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> is reproduced both from suckers andcuttings, in a trench of the same dimensions. Stakes may becut from it at the end of about three years mostly. Thesestakes are also used to supply the place of the trees as theygrow old, being fixed in the ground as layers, and cut awayfrom the trunk at the end of a year. A single jugerum of<pb n="3493" />osier willows will supply osiers<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> sufficient for twenty-five jugeraof vines. It is for a similar purpose that the white poplar<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>is grown; the trenches being two feet deep and the cutting afoot and a half in length. It is left to dry for a couple of daysbefore it is planted, and a space is left between the plants a footand a palm in width, after which they are covered with earthto the depth of a couple of cubits.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The maple, linden, elm, and arundo donax, are still employed, as wellas the willow, for this purpose; the latter, however, but very rarely. Theaccount of its cultivation here given is borrowed from Columella, De ReRust.
