<div2 type="chapter" n="2" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 2.—THE VARIOUS KINDS OF UNGUENTS—TWELVE PRIN-CIPAL COMPOSITIONS.</head><p>The names of unguents are due, some of them, to the original place of their composition, others, again, to the extractswhich form their bases, others to the trees from which theyare derived, and others to the peculiar circumstance underwhich they were first made: and it is as well, first of all, toknow that in this respect the fashion has often changed, andthat the high repute of peculiar kinds has been but transitory.In ancient times, the perfumes the most esteemed of all werethose of the island of Delos,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and at a later period those ofMendes.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> This degree of esteem is founded, not only on themode of mixing them and the relative proportions, but according to the degree of favour or disfavour in which the variousplaces which produce the ingredients are held, and the comparative excellence or degeneracy of the ingredients themselves.The perfume of iris,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> from Corinth, was long held in thehighest esteem, till that of Cyzicus came into fashion. It wasthe same, too, with the perfume of roses,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> from Phaselis,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> the<pb n="3161" />repute of which was afterwards eclipsed by those of Neapolis,Capua, and Præneste. Oil of saffron,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> from Soli in Cilicia,was for a long time held in repute beyond any other, and thenthat from Rhodes; after which perfume of œnanthe,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> from Cyprus, came into fashion, and then that of Egypt was preferred.At a later period that of Adramytteum came into vogue, andthen was supplanted by unguent of marjoram,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> from Cos,which in its turn was superseded by quince blossom<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> unguentfrom the same place. As to perfume of cyprus,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> that fromthe island of Cyprus was at first preferred, and then that ofEgypt; when all on a sudden the unguents of Mendes andmetopium<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> rose into esteem. In later times Phœnicia eclipsedEgypt in the manufacture of these last two, but left to thatcountry the repute of producing the best unguent of cyprus.</p><p>Athens has perseveringly maintained the repute of herpanathenaicon.<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> There was formerly a famous unguent,known as "pardalium,"<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> and made at Tarsus; at the presentday its very composition and the mode of mixing it are quiteunknown there: they have left off, too, making unguent ofnarcissus<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> from the flowers of that plant.</p><p>There are two elements which enter into the composition ofunguents, the juices and the solid parts. The former generallyconsist of various kinds of oils, the latter of odoriferous substances. These last are known as hedysmata, while the oilsare called stymmata.<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> There is a third element, which occu-<pb n="3162" />pies a place between the two, but has been much neglected,the colouring matter, namely. To produce a colour, however,cinnabar<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> and alkanet<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> are often employed. If salt<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> issprinkled in the oil, it will aid it in retaining its properties;but if alkanet has been employed, salt is never used. Resinand gum are added to fix the odour in the solid perfumes;indeed it is apt to die away and disappear with the greatestrapidity if these substances are not employed.</p><p>The unguent which is the most readily prepared of all,and indeed, in all probability, the very first that was evermade, is that composed of bryon<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> and oil of balanus,<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> substances of which we have made mention already. In latertimes the Mendesian unguent was invented, a more complicated mixture, as resin and myrrh were added to oil of balanus, and at the present day they even add metopion<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> aswell, an Egyptian oil extracted from bitter almonds; to whichhave been added omphacium,<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> cardamum,<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span> sweet rush,<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span> honey,<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span>wine, myrrh, seed of balsamum,<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span> galbanum,<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span> and resin ofterebinth,<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span> as so many ingredients. Among the most commonunguents at the present day, and for that reason supposed tobe the most ancient, is that composed of oil of myrtle,<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span> calamus, cypress,<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span> cyprus, mastich,<span id="ref_31"><a href="#note_31">[31]</a></span> and pomegranate-rind.<span id="ref_32"><a href="#note_32">[32]</a></span> I am<pb n="3163" />of opinion, however, that the unguents which have been themost universally adopted, are those which are compounded ofthe rose, a flower that grows everywhere; and hence fora long time the composition of oil of roses was of the mostsimple nature, though more recently there have been addedomphacium, rose blossoms, cinnabar, calamus, honey, sweet-rush, flour of salt or else alkanet,<span id="ref_33"><a href="#note_33">[33]</a></span> and wine. The sameis the case, too, with oil of saffron, to which have been latelyaddedcinnabar, alkanet, and wine; and with oil of sampsuchum,<span id="ref_34"><a href="#note_34">[34]</a></span>with which omphacium and calamus have been compounded.The best comes from Cyprus and Mitylene, where sampsuchumabounds in large quantities.</p><p>The commoner kinds of oil, too, are mixed with those ofmyrrh and laurel, to which are added sampsuchum, lilies,fenugreek, myrrh, cassia,<span id="ref_35"><a href="#note_35">[35]</a></span> nard,<span id="ref_36"><a href="#note_36">[36]</a></span> sweet-rush, and cinnamon.<span id="ref_37"><a href="#note_37">[37]</a></span>There is an oil, too, made of the common quince and thesparrow quince, called melinum, as we shall have occasion tomention hereafter;<span id="ref_38"><a href="#note_38">[38]</a></span> it is used as an ingredient in unguents,mixed with omphacium, oil of cyprus, oil of sesamum,<span id="ref_39"><a href="#note_39">[39]</a></span> balsamum,<span id="ref_40"><a href="#note_40">[40]</a></span> sweet-rush, cassia, and abrotonum.<span id="ref_41"><a href="#note_41">[41]</a></span> Susinum<span id="ref_42"><a href="#note_42">[42]</a></span> isthe most fluid of them all: it is made of lilies, oil of balanus,calamus, honey, cinnamon, saffron,<span id="ref_43"><a href="#note_43">[43]</a></span> and myrrh; while theunguent of cyprus<span id="ref_44"><a href="#note_44">[44]</a></span> is compounded of cyprus, omphacium<pb n="3164" />and cardamum, calamus, aspalathus,<span id="ref_45"><a href="#note_45">[45]</a></span> and abrotonum. Thereare some persons who, when making unguent of cyprus, employ myrrh also, and panax:<span id="ref_46"><a href="#note_46">[46]</a></span> the best is that made at Sidon,and the next best that of Egypt: care must be taken not toadd oil of sesamum: it will keep as long as four years, and itsodour is strengthened by the addition of cinnamon. Telinum<span id="ref_47"><a href="#note_47">[47]</a></span>is made of fresh olive-oil, cypirus,<span id="ref_48"><a href="#note_48">[48]</a></span> calamus, melilote,<span id="ref_49"><a href="#note_49">[49]</a></span> fenugreek, honey, marum,<span id="ref_50"><a href="#note_50">[50]</a></span> and sweet marjoram. This last wasthe perfume most in vogue in the time of the Comic poetMenander: a considerable time after that known as "megalium" took its place, being so called as holding the veryhighest rank;<span id="ref_51"><a href="#note_51">[51]</a></span> it was composed of oil of balanus, balsamum,calamus, sweet-rush, xylobalsamum,<span id="ref_52"><a href="#note_52">[52]</a></span> cassia, and resin. Onepeculiar property of this unguent is, that it requires to beconstantly stirred while boiling, until it has lost all smell:when it becomes cold, it recovers its odour.<span id="ref_53"><a href="#note_53">[53]</a></span></p><p>There are some single essences also which, individually,afford unguents of very high character: the first rank is dueto malobathrum,<span id="ref_54"><a href="#note_54">[54]</a></span> and the next to the iris of Illyricum andthe sweet marjoram of Cyzicus, both of them herbs. Thereare perfumers who sometimes add some few other ingredientsto these: those who use the most, employ for the purposehoney, flour of salt, omphacium, leaves of agnus,<span id="ref_55"><a href="#note_55">[55]</a></span> and panax,all of them foreign ingredients.<span id="ref_56"><a href="#note_56">[56]</a></span> The price of unguent<span id="ref_57"><a href="#note_57">[57]</a></span> of<pb n="3165" />cinnamon is quite enormous; to cinnamon there is added oilof balanus, xylobalsamum, calamus, sweet-rush, seeds ofbalsamum, myrrh, and perfumed honey: it is the thickest inconsistency of all the unguents; the price at which it sellsranges from thirty-five to three hundred denarii per pound.Unguent of nard,<span id="ref_58"><a href="#note_58">[58]</a></span> or foliatum, is composed of omphacium orelse oil of balanus, sweet-rush, costus,<span id="ref_59"><a href="#note_59">[59]</a></span> nard, amomum,<span id="ref_60"><a href="#note_60">[60]</a></span>myrrh, and balsamum.</p><p>While speaking on this subject, it will be as well to bear inmind that there are nine different kinds of plants of a similarkind, of which we have already made mention<span id="ref_61"><a href="#note_61">[61]</a></span> as being employed for the purpose of imitating Indian nard; so abundant are the materials that are afforded for adulteration. Allthese perfumes are rendered still more pungent by the addition of costus and amomum, which have a particularly powerful effect on the olfactory organs; while myrrh gives themgreater consistency and additional sweetness, and saffron makesthem better adapted for medicinal purposes. They are mostpungent, however, when mixed with amomum alone, whichwill often produce head-ache even. There are some persons whocontent themselves with sprinkling the more precious ingredients upon the others after boiling them down, for the purpose of economy; but the strength of the unguent is not sogreat as when the ingredients have been boiled together.Myrrh used by itself, and without the mixture of oil, formsan unguent, but it is stacte<span id="ref_62"><a href="#note_62">[62]</a></span> only that must be used, for otherwise it will be productive of too great bitterness. Unguent ofcyprus turns other unguents green, while lily unguent<span id="ref_63"><a href="#note_63">[63]</a></span> makesthem more unctuous: the unguent of Mendes turns themblack, rose unguent makes them white, and that of myrrhof a pallid hue.</p><p>Such are the particulars of the ancient inventions, and thevarious falsifications of the shops in later times; we will nowpass on to make mention of what is the very height of refinement in these articles of luxury, indeed, I may say, the beauideal<span id="ref_64"><a href="#note_64">[64]</a></span> of them all.<span id="ref_65"><a href="#note_65">[65]</a></span><pb n="3166" /></p><p>(2.) This is what is called the "regal" unguent, from thefact that it is composed in these proportions for the kings ofthe Parthians. It consists of myrobalanus,<span id="ref_66"><a href="#note_66">[66]</a></span> costus, amomum,cinnamon, comacum,<span id="ref_67"><a href="#note_67">[67]</a></span> cardamum, spikenard, marum, myrrh,cassia, storax,<span id="ref_68"><a href="#note_68">[68]</a></span> ladanum,<span id="ref_69"><a href="#note_69">[69]</a></span> opobalsamum, Syrian calamus<span id="ref_70"><a href="#note_70">[70]</a></span> andSyrian sweet-rush,<span id="ref_71"><a href="#note_71">[71]</a></span> œnanthe, malobathrum, serichatum,<span id="ref_72"><a href="#note_72">[72]</a></span>cyprus, aspralathus, panax, saffron, cypirus, sweet marjoram,lotus,<span id="ref_73"><a href="#note_73">[73]</a></span> honey, and wine. Not one of the ingredients in thiscompound is produced either in Italy, that conqueror of theworld, or, indeed, in all Europe, with the exception of theiris, which grows in Illyricum, and the nard, which is to befound in Gaul: as to the wine, the rose, the leaves of myrtle, and the olive-oil, they are possessed by pretty nearly allcountries in common.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The perfumes of Delos themselves had nothing in particular to recommend them; but as it was the centre of the worship of Apollo, it is notimprobable that exquisite perfumes formed a large proportion of the offerings brought thither from all parts of the world.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In Egypt.
