<div2 type="chapter" n="28" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 28.—THE FRUIT OF THE ARBUTUS.</head><p>The flesh of the ground-strawberry<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> is very different tothat of the arbute-tree,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> which is of a kindred kind: indeed,this is the only instance in which we find a similar fruit growing upon a tree and on the ground. The tree is tufted andbushy; the fruit takes a year to ripen, the blossoms of theyoung fruit flowering while that of the preceding year isarriving at maturity. Whether it is the male tree or thefemale that is unproductive, authors are not generally agreed.</p><p>This is a fruit held in no esteem, in proof of which it has<pb n="3321" />gained its name of "unedo,"<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> people being generally content with eating but one. The Greeks, however, have foundfor it two names—"comaron" and "memecylon," from whichit would appear<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> that there are two varieties. It has alsowith us another name besides that of "unedo," being knownalso as the "arbutus." Juba states that in Arabia this treeattains the height of fifty cubits.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The common strawberry, the Fragaria vesca of Linnæus.

A native of the Alps and the forests of Gaul, it was unknown tothe Greeks.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Arbutus unedo of Linnæus. It is one of the ericaceous trees,and its fruit bears a considerable resemblance to the strawberry—otherwisethere is not the slightest affinity between them. The taste of the arbuteis poor indeed, compared to that of the strawberry.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He suggests that it is so called from "unum edo," "I eat but one;"a rather fanciful etymology, it would seem.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This supposition is not warranted, from merely the fact of there beingtwo names.</p></body>
