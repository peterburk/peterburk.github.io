<div2 type="chapter" n="41" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 41. (8.)—HYDRARGYROS. REMEDIES DERIVED FROM MINIUM.</head><p>Human industry has also discovered a method of extractinghydrargyros<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> from the inferior minium, a substitute for quick-silver,the further mention of which was deferred, a few pagesbefore,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> to the present occasion. There are two methods ofpreparing this substance; either by pounding minium andvinegar with a brazen pestle and mortar, or else by puttingminium into flat earthen pans, covered with a lid, and thenenclosed in an iron seething-pot well luted with potter's clay.A fire is then lighted under the pans, and the flame kept continuallyburning by the aid of the bellows; which done, thesteam is carefully removed, that is found adhering to the lid,being like silver in colour, and similar to water in its fluidity.This liquid, too, is easily made to separate in globules, which,from their fluid nature, readily unite.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span></p><p>As it is a fact generally admitted, that minium is a poison,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>I look upon all the recipes given as highly dangerous whichrecommend its employment for medicinal purposes; with theexception, perhaps, of those cases in which it is applied to thehead or abdomen, for the purpose of arresting hæmorrhage,due care being taken that it is not allowed to penetrate to theviscera, or to touch any sore. Beyond such cases as these, formy own part, I should never recommend it to be used inmedicine.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or artificial quicksilver.
