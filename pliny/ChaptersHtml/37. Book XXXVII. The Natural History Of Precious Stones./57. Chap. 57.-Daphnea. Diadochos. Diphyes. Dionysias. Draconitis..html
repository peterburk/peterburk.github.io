<div2 type="chapter" n="57" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 57.—DAPHNEA. DIADOCHOS. DIPHYES. DIONYSIAS.DRACONITIS.</head><p>Daphnea<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> is mentioned by Zoroaster as curative of epilepsy.Diadochos<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> is a stone that resembles the beryl. Of diphyes<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>there are two kinds, the white and the black, male and female,with a line dividing the characteristics of either sex. Dionysias<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>is hard and black, and covered with red spots. Triturated inwater, this stone imparts to it the flavour of wine, and it isgenerally thought to be a preservative against intoxication.Draconitis<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> or dracontia is a stone produced from the brain ofthe dragon;<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> but unless the head of the animal is cut offwhile it is alive, the stone will not assume the form of a gem,through spite on the part of the serpent, when finding itself atthe point of death: hence it is that, for this purpose, the headis cut off when it is asleep.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span></p><p>Sotacus, who tells us that he once saw a stone of this kind inthe possession of a king, says that persons go in search of it ina chariot drawn by two horses; and that, the moment they seethe serpent, they strew narcotic drugs in its way, and then cutoff its head when asleep. According to him, this stone iswhite and pellucid, and admits of no polishing or engraving.<pb n="6448" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Laurel-stone."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Substitute" for beryl.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Two-formed," or "of a double nature."
