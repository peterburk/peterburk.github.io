FOURREMEDIES DERIVED FROM IT.</head><p>Having to make mention, in the present Book, of the eggsof the goose and the numerous uses to which they are applied,as also of the bird itself, it is our duty to award the honour toCommagene<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> of a most celebrated preparation there made.This composition is prepared from goose-grease, a substanceapplied to many other well-known uses as well; but in thecase of that which comes from Commagene, a part of Syria, thegrease is first incorporated with cinnamon, cassia,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> white pepper, and the plant called "commagene,"<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and then placed invessels and buried in the snow. The mixture has an agreeable smell, and is found extremely useful for cold shiverings,convulsions, heavy or sudden pains, and all those affections, infact, which are treated with the class of remedies known as"acopa;"<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> being equally an unguent and a medicament.</p><p>There is another method, also, of preparing it in Syria: thefat of the bird is preserved in manner already<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> described, and<pb n="5391" />there is added to it erysisceptrum,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> xylobalsamum,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> palmelate,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> and calamus, each in the same proportion as the grease;the whole being gently boiled some two or three times in wine.This preparation is made in winter, as in summer it will neverthicken, except with the addition of wax. There are numerous other remedies, also, derived from the goose, as well asfrom the raven;<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> a thing I am much surprised at, seeing thatboth the goose and the raven<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> are generally said to be in adiseased state at the end of summer and the beginning ofautumn.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. v. cc. 13, 20.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xii. c. 43.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. x. c. 28.
