<div2 type="chapter" n="35" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 35.—CYPRUS.</head><p>The Pamphylian Sea contains some islands of little note.The Cilician, besides four others of very considerable size, hasCyprus<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>, which lies opposite to the shores of Cilicia and Syria,running east and west; in former times it was the seatof nine kingdoms. Timosthenes states that the circumferenceof this island is 427 miles, Isidorus<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> 375; its length,between the two Promontories of Dinæ<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and Acamas<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> lyingon the west, is, according to Artemidorus, 160 1/2 miles, accordingto Timosthenes, 200. Philonides says that it wasformerly called Acamantis, Xenagoras that it had thenames of Cerastis<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>, Aspelia, Amathusia, and Macaria<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>,while Astynomus gives it the names of Cryptos<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> and Colinia.Its towns are fifteen in number, Neapaphos<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>,Palæpaphos<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>, Curias<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>, Citium<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>, Corineum, Salamis<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>, Ama-<pb n="1481" />thus<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>, Lapethos<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>, Solœ, Tamasos<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>, Epidarum,Chytri<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span>, Arsinoë<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span>, Carpasimn<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span>, andGolgi<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span>. The towns of Cinyria, Marium, andIdalium<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> are no longer in existence. Itis distantfrom Anemurium<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> in Cilicia fifty miles; the sea which runsbetween the two shores being called the Channel of Cilicia<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span>.In the same locality<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span> is the island of Eleusa<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span>, and the four<pb n="1482" />islands known as the Clides<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span>, lying before the promontorywhich faces Syria; and again at the end of the other cape<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span>is Stiria: over against Neapaphos is Hierocepia<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span>, and opposite to Salamis are the Salaininiæ.</p><p>In the Lycian Sea are the islands of Illyris, Telendos,and Attelebussa<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span>, the three barren isles called Cypriæ, andDionysia, formerly called Caretha. Opposite to the Promontory ofTaurus are the Chelidoniæ<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span>, as many in number, and extremelydangerous to mariners. Further on wefind Leucolla with its town, the Pactyæ<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span>, Lasia, Nymphäis,Macris, and Megista, the city on which last no longer exists.After these there are many that are not worthy of notice.Opposite, however, to Cape Chimæra is Dolichiste<span id="ref_31"><a href="#note_31">[31]</a></span>,Chœrogylion, Crambussa<span id="ref_32"><a href="#note_32">[32]</a></span>, Rhoge<span id="ref_33"><a href="#note_33">[33]</a></span>, Enagora, eight milesin circumference, the two islands of Dædala<span id="ref_34"><a href="#note_34">[34]</a></span>, the three ofCrya<span id="ref_35"><a href="#note_35">[35]</a></span>,<pb n="1483" />Strongyle, and over against Sidyma<span id="ref_36"><a href="#note_36">[36]</a></span> the isle of Antiochus.Towards the mouth of the river Glaucus<span id="ref_37"><a href="#note_37">[37]</a></span>, there are Lagussa<span id="ref_38"><a href="#note_38">[38]</a></span>,Macris, Didymæ Helbo, Scope, Aspis, Telandria, the townof which no longer exists, and, in the vicinity of Caunus<span id="ref_39"><a href="#note_39">[39]</a></span>,Rhodussa.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called Kibris.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Strabo makes it 425. Hardouin remarks that Isidorus has not made allowance for the margin of the creeks and bays.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The north-eastern extremity of Cyprus. It is now called Capo Sant Andreas. It is more generally known in the editions of Pliny by the name of Dinaretum.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called Capo Sant Epifanio, or Pifano, after the celebrated metropolitan of Cyprus. It is the western extremity of the island.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From the Greek <foreign lang="greek">ke/ras</foreign>"a horn." It was not improbably so called from the numerous <hi rend="ital">horns</hi> or promontories on its coast.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From the Greek <foreign lang="greek">maka/rios</foreign> "blessed," in compliment to its fertile soil and delightful temperature.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Apparently from the Greek <foreign lang="greek">krupto\s</foreign> "concealed." Stephanus Byzantinus says that it was so called because it was frequently hidden beneath the surface of the sea.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or New Paphos. The spot is still called Bafa or Bafo.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or Old Paphos, now Kukala or Konuklia. Old Paphos was situate near the promontory Zephyrium on the river Bocarno, where it had a good harbour; while New Paphos lay more inland, in the midst of a fertile plain, sixty stadia from the former. Old Paphos was the chief seat of worship of Aphrodite or Venus, who was said to have landed at that place after her ascent from the sea.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Situate on the most southerly point in the island; now Capo Gavatta or delle Gatte.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A town situate on the south coast of Cyprus. Its ruins are to be seen between Larnika and the port now known as Salines; they are very extensive. In B. xxx. c. 9, Pliny speaks of the salt lakes near this place, which are worked at the present day.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In the middle of the east coast. It was said to have been founded by Teucer the son of Telamon, who gave it the name of his native land from which he had been banished by his father.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called Old Limasol, a town on the south coast, celebrated forits worship of Aphrodite or Venus. It was a Phœnician settlement, andStephanus calls it the most ancient city in the island. It long preservedits oriental customs, and here the Tyrian Hercules was worshipped underhis name of Melkart.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Its site is now called Lapitho or Lapta.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably the same as the Temncse of Homer. It was situate in afertile district in the middle of Cyprus, and in the neighbourhood ofextensive copper mines. Near it was a celebrated plain,sacred to Venus, mentioned by Ovid.</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called Chytria, a town of Cyprus on the road from Cerinea toSalamis.</p><p><span id="note_17"><a href="#ref_17">17. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In the east of Cyprus, near the Promontory of Acamas, formerlycalled Marion. Ptolemy Soter destroyed this town, and removed theinhabitants to Paphos. The modern name of its site is Polikrusoko orCrisophou, from the gold mines in the neighbourhood. There was morethan one city of this name in Cyprus, which was probably bestowed onthem during its subjection to the princes of the line of Lagus. AnotherArsinoë is placed near Ammochostus to the north of the island, and athird of the same name appears in Strabo with a harbour, temple andgrove, between Old and New Paphos.</p><p><span id="note_18"><a href="#ref_18">18. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or Carpasia, to the north-east of the island, facing the Promontoryof Sarpedon on the Cilician coast. It was said to have been founded byPygmalion, king of Tyre. Pococke speaks of remains at Carpas, the siteof this place, especially a long wall and a pier.</p><p><span id="note_19"><a href="#ref_19">19. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or Golgos, famous for the worship of Aphrodite or Venus, whichhad existed here even before its introduction at Paphos by Agapenor.Its position is unknown.</p><p><span id="note_20"><a href="#ref_20">20. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or Idalia, adjoining to which was a forest sacred to Aphrodite. Thepoets, who connect this place with her worship, give us no indicationswhatever of its precise locality. Engel identifies it with the modernDalin, situate to the south of Leucosia, at the foot of Mount Olympus.</p><p><span id="note_21"><a href="#ref_21">21. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Cape Anamur.</p><p><span id="note_22"><a href="#ref_22">22. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Aulon Cilicium," now the Sea of Caramania or Cyprus.</p><p><span id="note_23"><a href="#ref_23">23. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Cilician Sea, namely.</p><p><span id="note_24"><a href="#ref_24">24. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There were several islands of this name. It is not improbable thatPliny alludes to the one lying off the coast of Caria between the isle ofRhodes and the mainland, and which seems to be the island markedAlessa in the maps. There was another of the same name close to theshore of Cilicia, afterwards known by the name of Sebaste.</p><p><span id="note_25"><a href="#ref_25">25. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or Cleides, meaning the "Keys." This was a group of small islandslying to the north-east of Cyprus. The name of the islands was after-wards transferred by some geographer to the Cape which Pliny abovecalls Dinæ, and others Dinaretum.</p><p><span id="note_26"><a href="#ref_26">26. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cape Acamas, now Pifano.</p><p><span id="note_27"><a href="#ref_27">27. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or the "Sacred Garden." The names of this and the Salaminiæ donot appear to be known to the modern geographers.</p><p><span id="note_28"><a href="#ref_28">28. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is identified by Beaufort with the islet called Bœshat, which isseparated by a narrow channel from the Lycian shore. The others donot seem to have been identified. Attelebussa is supposed to take itsname from a kind of destructive grasshopper without wings, called bythe Greeks <foreign lang="greek">a)tte/lebos.</foreign></p><p><span id="note_29"><a href="#ref_29">29. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Situate off the commencement of the sea-coast of Pamphylia, on theborders of Lycia. Beaufort speaks of them as five in number; he didnot meet with any of the dangers of the navigation here mentioned byPliny. The Greeks still call them Chelidoniæ, and the Italian sailorsCelidoni, which the Turks have corrupted into Shelidan.</p><p><span id="note_30"><a href="#ref_30">30. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hardouin supposes these four islands to be the names of the groupforming the Pactyæ. The names given appear to signify, the "Wild"or "Rough Islands," the "Isle of the Nymphs," the "Long Island," andthe "Greatest Island." They were off the coast of Lycia, and seem tohave belonged to the Rhodians. The modern name of Megista is Kastelorizo, according to Ansart.</p><p><span id="note_31"><a href="#ref_31">31. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or Doliche, the "Long Island," in the Lycian Sea, west of the ruinsof Myra. Its modern name is Kakava. It is now uninhabited.</p><p><span id="note_32"><a href="#ref_32">32. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Still known as Grambousa, a small island off the east coast of Lycia.There seems to have been another of the same name off the Lycian coast.</p><p><span id="note_33"><a href="#ref_33">33. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">An island off the coast of Lycia.</p><p><span id="note_34"><a href="#ref_34">34. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hardouin thinks that they were opposite to the city of Dædala onthe coast of Caria.</p><p><span id="note_35"><a href="#ref_35">35. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Off the city of Crya, probably, in Caria.</p><p><span id="note_36"><a href="#ref_36">36. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">On the coast of Lycia.</p><p><span id="note_37"><a href="#ref_37">37. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In Lycia.
