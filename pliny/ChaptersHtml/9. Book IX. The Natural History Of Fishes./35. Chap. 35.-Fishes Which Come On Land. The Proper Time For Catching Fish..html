THE PROPER TIME FORCATCHING FISH.</head><p>Those fish, also, which are known by the name of sea-mice,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span><pb n="2407" />as well as the polyp<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and the murænæ,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> are in the habit ofcoming ashore—Besides which, there is in the rivers of India<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>one kind that does this, and then leaps back again into thewater—for they are found to pass over into standing waters andstreams. Most fishes have an evident instinct, which teachesthem where to spawn in safety; as in such places there are noenemies found to devour their young, while at the same timethe waves are much less violent. It will be still more a matterof surprise, to find that they thus have an appreciation of causeand effect, and understand the regular recurrence of periods,when we reflect how few persons there are that know that themost favourable time for taking fish is while the sun is passingthrough the sign of Pisces.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Marini mures." Cuvier says, that according to Oppian, Halieut. B.v. c. 174, <hi rend="ital">et seq.,</hi> the sea-mice, small as they are, attack other fish, andoffer resistance even to man himself. Their skin, he says, is very solid,and their teeth very strong. Theophrastus names them along with sealsand birds, as feeding both on land and at sea. Cuvier is somewhat at aloss whether to pronounce them, with Dalechamps, to be a kind of turtle.If so, he considers that this would be the little turtle, Testudo coriacea ofLinnæus, which is by no means uncommon in the Mediterranean. Hesuggests, however, that there are equal grounds for taking it to be theFlasco psaro, or Tetrodon lineatus of Linnæus.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Sepia octopodia of Linnæus.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Muræna helena of Linnæus. This animal, Cuvier says, like theeel, is able to live out of water, in consequence of the minute size of thebranchial orifices, as Theophrastus very accurately explains. It is a common opinion that they come out of the water in search of others of theirkind; but Spallanzani was informed by the fishermen of Comacchio, thatthis hardly ever is the case, and that they will only leave the water whencompelled. The polypus also crawls very briskly on the shore when it hasbeen thrown up by the tide, and moves with considerable swiftness.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is also stated by the author of the treatise, De Mirab. Auscult.c. 72; and Theophrastus, in his work on the "Fishes that can live on land,"says, that these Indian fishes resemble the mullet. Cuvier says, that thesefish are those known as the various species of the genus Ophicephalus ofBloch, which bear a strong resemblance to the mullet in the head andbody. Mr. Hamilton Buchanan, in his "History of the Fishes of Bengal,"says, that these fish crawl on the grass to so great a distance from theirrivers, that the people absolutely believe that they must have fallen fromheaven.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or the "Fishes." As if, indeed, Hardouin says, the resemblance ofname given to the constellation could have any effect upon the fish!</p></body>
