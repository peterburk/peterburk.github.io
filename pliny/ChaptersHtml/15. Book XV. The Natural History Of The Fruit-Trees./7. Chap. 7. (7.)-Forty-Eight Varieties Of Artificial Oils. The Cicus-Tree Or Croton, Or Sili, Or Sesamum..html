<div2 type="chapter" n="7" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 7. (7.)—FORTY-EIGHT VARIETIES OF ARTIFICIAL OILS. THE CICUS-TREE OR CROTON, OR SILI, OR SESAMUM.</head><p>In those times artificial oils had not been introduced, and<pb n="3287" />hence it is, I suppose, that we find no mention made of themby Cato; at the present day the varieties are very numerous.We will first speak of those<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> which are produced from trees,and among them more particularly the wild olive.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> Thisolive is small, and much more bitter than the cultivated one,and hence its oil is only used in medicinal preparations: theoil that bears the closest resemblance to it is that extractedfrom the chamelæa,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> a shrub which grows among the rocks,and not more than a palm in height; the leaves and berriesbeing similar to those of the wild olive. A third oil is thatmade of the fruit of the cicus,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> a tree which grows in Egyptin great abundance; by some it is known as croton, by othersas sili, and by others, again, as wild sesamumn: it is not so verylong since this tree was first introduced here. In Spain, too,it shoots up with great rapidity to the size of the olive-tree,having a stem like that of the ferula, the leaf of the vine,and a seed that bears a resemblance to a small pale grape.Our people are in the habit of calling it "ricinus,"<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> from theresemblance of the seed to that insect. It is boiled in water,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>and the oil that swims on the surface is then skimmed off:but in Egypt, where it grows in a greater abundance, the oil isextracted without employing either fire or water for the purpose, the seed being first sprinkled with salt, and then subjected to pressure: eaten with food this oil is repulsive, but itis very useful for burning in lamps.</p><p>Amygdalinum, by some persons known as "metopium,"<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span><pb n="3288" />is made of bitter almonds dried and beaten into a cake, afterwhich they are steeped in water, and then beaten again. Anoil is extracted from the laurel also, with the aid of olive oil.Some persons use the berries only for this purpose, whileothers, again, employ the leaves<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> and the outer skin of theberries: some add storax also, and other odoriferous substances. The best kind for this purpose is the broad-leaved orwild laurel,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> with a black berry. The oil, too, of the blackmyrtle is of a similar nature; that with the broad leaf<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> isreckoned also the best. The berries are first sprinkled withwarm water, and then beaten, after which they are boiled:some persons take the more tender leaves, and boil them inolive oil, and then subject them to pressure, while others, again,steep them in oil, and leave the mixture to ripen in the sun.The same method is also adopted with the cultivated myrtle,but the wild variety with small berries is generally preferred;by some it is known as the oxymyrsine, by others as the chamæmyrsine, and by others, again, as the acoron,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> from itsstrong resemblance to that plant, it being short and branching.</p><p>An oil is made, too, from the citrus,<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> and from the cypress;also, from the walnut,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> and known by the name of "caryinon,"<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> and from the fruit of the cedar, being generallyknown as "pisselæon."<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> Oil is extracted from the grain ofCnidos,<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> the seed being first thoroughly cleaned, and then<pb n="3289" />pounded; and from mastich<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> also. As to the oil called"cyprinum,"<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> and that extracted from the Egyptian<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> berry,we have already mentioned the mode in which they are prepared as perfumes. The Indians, too, are said to extract oilsfrom the chesnut,<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> sesamum, and rice,<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> and the Ichthyophagi<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> from fish. Scarcity of oil for the supply of lampssometimes compels us to make it from the berries<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span> of the planetree, which are first steeped in salt and water.</p><p>Œnanthinum,<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span> again, is made from the œnanthe, as we havealready stated when speaking of perfumes. In making gleucinum,<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span> must is boiled with olive-oil at a slow heat; somepersons, however, do not employ fire in making it, but leave avessel, filled with oil and must, surrounded with grape husks,for two and twenty days, taking care to stir it twice a day:by the end of that period the whole of the must is imbibedby the oil. Some persons mix with this not only sampsuchum, but perfumes of still greater price: that, too, which isused in the gymnasia is scented with perfumes as well, butthose of the very lowest quality. Oils are made, too, from aspalathus,<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span> from calamus,<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span> balsamum,<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span> cardamum,<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span> melilot,Gallic nard, panax,<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span> sampsuchum,<span id="ref_31"><a href="#note_31">[31]</a></span> helenium, and root ofcinnamomum,<span id="ref_32"><a href="#note_32">[32]</a></span> the plants being first left to steep in oil, andthen pressed. In a similar manner, too, rhodinum<span id="ref_33"><a href="#note_33">[33]</a></span> is madefrom roses, and juncinum from the sweet rush, bearing a remarkable<span id="ref_34"><a href="#note_34">[34]</a></span> resemblance to rose-oil: other oils, again, are extracted<pb n="3290" />from henbane,<span id="ref_35"><a href="#note_35">[35]</a></span> lupines,<span id="ref_36"><a href="#note_36">[36]</a></span> and narcissus. Great quantities ofoil are made in Egypt, too, of radish<span id="ref_37"><a href="#note_37">[37]</a></span> seed, or else of acommon grass known there as chortinon.<span id="ref_38"><a href="#note_38">[38]</a></span> Sesamum<span id="ref_39"><a href="#note_39">[39]</a></span> alsoyields an oil, and so does the nettle,<span id="ref_40"><a href="#note_40">[40]</a></span> its oil being known as"enidinum."<span id="ref_41"><a href="#note_41">[41]</a></span> In other countries, too, an oil is extractedfrom lilies<span id="ref_42"><a href="#note_42">[42]</a></span> left to steep in the open air, and subjected to theinfluence of the sun, moon, and frosts. On the borders ofCappadocia and Galatia, they make an oil from the herbs ofthe country, known as "Selgicum,"<span id="ref_43"><a href="#note_43">[43]</a></span> remarkably useful forstrengthening the tendons, similar, in fact, to that of Iguvium<span id="ref_44"><a href="#note_44">[44]</a></span>in Italy. From pitch an oil<span id="ref_45"><a href="#note_45">[45]</a></span> is extracted, that is known aspissinum;" it is made by boiling the pitch, and spreadingfleeces over the vessels to catch the steam, and then wringing them out: the most approved kind is that which comesfrom Bruttium, the pitch of that country being remarkablyrich and resinous: the colour of this oil is yellow.</p><p>There is an oil that grows spontaneously in the maritimeparts of Syria, known to us as "elæomeli;"<span id="ref_46"><a href="#note_46">[46]</a></span> it is an unctuoussubstance which distils from certain trees, of a thicker consistency than honey, but somewhat thinner than resin; it has asweet flavour, and is employed for medicinal purposes. Oldolive oil<span id="ref_47"><a href="#note_47">[47]</a></span> is of use for some kinds of maladies; it is thought to<pb n="3291" />be particularly useful, too, in the preservation of ivory fromdecay:<span id="ref_48"><a href="#note_48">[48]</a></span> at all events, the statue of Saturn, at Rome, is filledwith oil in the interior.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It may be remarked, that in this Chapter Pliny totally confoundsfixed oils, volatile oils, and medicinal oils.

See B.xiii. c. 35, also 1. xliv. c. 82.

Though it appears to have beenformerly sometimes used for the table, at the present day the oil is onlyknown as "castor" oil, a strong purgative. It is one of the fixed oils. TheJews and Abyssinian Christians say that it was under this tree that Jonahsat.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A "tick."</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This method, Fée says, is still pursued in America.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xiii. c. 2.
