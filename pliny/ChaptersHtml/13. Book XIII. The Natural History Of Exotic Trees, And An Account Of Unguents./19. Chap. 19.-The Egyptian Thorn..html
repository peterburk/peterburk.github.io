<div2 type="chapter" n="19" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 19.—THE EGYPTIAN THORN.</head><p>No less esteemed, too, in the same country, is a certain kindof thorn,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> though only the black variety, its wood being imperishable, in water even, a quality which renders it particularly valuable for making the sides of ships: on the other hand,the white kinds will rot very rapidly. It has sharp, pricklythorns on the leaves even, and bears its seeds in pods; theyare employed for the same purposes as galls in the preparationof leather. The flower, too, has a pretty effect when madeinto garlands, and is extremely useful in medicinal preparations.A gum, also, distils from this tree; but the principal meritthat it possesses is, that when it is cut down, it will growagain within three years. It grows in the vicinity of Thebes,where we also find the quercus, the Persian tree, and the olive:the spot that produces it is a piece of woodland, distant three<pb n="3184" />hundred stadia from the Nile, and watered by springs of itsown.</p><p>(10.) Here we find, too, the Egyptian<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> plum-tree, not muchunlike the thorn last mentioned, with a fruit similar to themedlar, and which ripens in the winter. This tree never losesits leaves. The seed in the fruit is of considerable size, butthe flesh of it, by reason of its quality, and the great abundance in which it grows, affords quite a harvest to the inhabitants of those parts; after cleaning it, they subject it to pressure,and then make it up into cakes for keeping. There was formerly<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> a woodland district in the vicinity of Memphis, withtrees of such enormous size, that three men could not spanone with their arms: one of these trees is remarkable, not forits fruit, or any particular use that it is, but for the singularphænomenon that it presents. In appearance it strongly resembles a thorn,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and it has leaves which have all the appearance of wings, and which fall immediately the branch istouched by any one, and then immediately shoot again.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxiv. c. 67. This is, no doubt, the Acacia Nilotica of Linnæus,which produces the gum Arabic of modern commerce.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is from Theophrastus, Hist. Plant. B. iv. c. 3. Fée suggeststhat it may have been a kind of myrobalanus. Sprengel identifies it withthe Cordia sebestana of the botanists.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Fuit." From the use of this word he seems uncertain as to its existence in his time; the account is copied from Theophrastus, Hist. Plant.B. iv. c. 3. Fée suggests that he may here allude to the Baobab, theAdansonia digitata, which grows in Senegal and Sennaar to an enormoussize. Prosper Alpinus speaks of it as existing in Egypt. The Arabs callit El-omarah, and the fruit El-kongles.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Mimosa polyacanthe, probably. Fée says that the mimosæ, respectively known as casta, pudibunda, viva, and sensitiva, with many ofthe inga, and other leguminous trees, are irritable in the highest degree.The tree here spoken of he considers to be one of the acacias. The passage in Theophrastus speaks of the leaf as shrinking, and not falling,and then as simply reviving.</p></body>
