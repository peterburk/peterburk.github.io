In thefig, the robur, and the plane, they are numerous; in the applethey are short and thin, while in the fir and the larch theyare single; and by this single root is the tree supported, although we find some small fibres thrown out from it laterallyThey are thick and unequal in the laurel and the olive, inwhich last they are branchy also; while in the robur theyare solid and fleshy.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> The robur, too, throws its roots downwards to a very considerable depth. Indeed, if we are to believe Virgil,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> the æsculus has a root that descends as deepinto the earth as the height to which the trunk ascends in theair. The roots of the olive, the apple, and the cypress, creepalmost upon the very surface: in some trees they run straightand horizontally, as in the laurel and the olive; while in othersthey have a sinuous course—the fig for example. In sometrees the roots are bristling with small filaments, as in thefir, and many of the forest trees; the mountaineers cut off<pb n="3394" />these fine filaments, and weave with them very handsomeflasks,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and various other articles.</p><p>Some writers say that the roots of trees do not descendbelow the level to which the sun's heat is able to penetrate;which, of course, depends upon the nature of the soil, whetherit happens to be thin or dense. This, however, I look upon<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>as a mistake: and, in fact, we find it stated by some authorsthat a fir was transplanted, the roots of which had penetratedeight cubits in depth, and even then the whole of it was nutdug up, it being torn asunder.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> The citrus has a root thatgoes the very deepest of all, and is of great extent; next afterit come the plane, the robur, and the various glandiferoustrees. In some trees, the laurel for instance, the roots aremore tenacious of life the nearer they are to the surface:hence, when the trunk withers, it is cut down, and the treeshoots again with redoubled vigour. Some think that theshorter the roots are, the more rapidly the tree decays; a supposition which is plainly contradicted by the fig, the root ofwhich is among the very largest, while the tree becomes agedat a remarkably early period. I regard also as incorrect whatsome authors have stated, as to the roots of trees diminishing<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>when they are old; for I once saw an ancient oak, uprootedby a storm, the roots of which covered a jugerum of ground.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The roots of trees being ligneous, " carnosæ," Fée remarks, is an inappropriate term.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Georg. ii. 291.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Lagenas."
