<div2 type="chapter" n="30" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 30. (21.)—THE LYNX, THE SPHINX, THE CROCOTTA, AND THE MONKEY.</head><p>Æthiopia produces the lynx<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> in abundance, and the sphinx,<pb n="2279" />which has brown hair and two mammæ on the breast,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> as wellas many monstrous kinds of a similar nature; horses withwings, and armed with horns, which are called pegasi;<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> thecrocotta, an animal which looks as though it had been producedby the union of the wolf and the dog,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> for it can break anything with its teeth, and instantly on swallowing it digest itwith the stomach; monkeys, too, with black heads, the hairof the ass, and a voice quite unlike that of any other animal.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>There are oxen, too, like those of India, some with one horn,and others with three; the leucrocotta, a wild beast of extraordinary swiftness, the size of the wild ass, with the legs ofa stag, the neck, tail, and breast of a lion, the head of a badger,a cloven hoof, the mouth slit up as far as the ears, and one continuous bone instead of teeth;<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> it is said, too, that this animalcan imitate the human voice. Among the same people, thereis also found an animal called eale; it is the size of the river-horse, has the tail of the elephant, and is of a black or tawny<pb n="2280" />colour.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> It has also the jaws of the wild boar, and horns that aremoveable, and more than a cubit in length, so that, in fighting,it can employ them alternately, and vary their position by presenting them directly or obliquely, according as necessity maydictate. But the wild bulls which this country produces arethe fiercest of all; they are larger than our domestic bull, andexceed all the others in swiftness; are of a tawny colour, withazure eyes, and the hair turned the contrary way; while thejaws open as far as the ears, and the horns are as moveableas those of the eale. The hide of this animal is as hard asflint, and effectually resists all wounds. These creatures pursueall the other wild beasts, while they themselves can only betaken in pitfalls, where they always perish from excess of rage.Ctesias informs us, that among these same Æthiopians, thereis an animal found, which he calls the mantichora;<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> it has atriple row of teeth, which fit into each other like those of acomb, the face and ears of a man, and azure eyes, is of the colourof blood, has the body of the lion, and a tail ending in a sting,like that of the scorpion. Its voice resembles the union ofthe sound of the flute and the trumpet; it is of excessiveswiftness, and is particularly fond of human flesh.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">According to Cuvier, the lynx of Pliny is the Felis caracal of Lin-næus: it is common in many parts of Asia and Africa, in the retiredforest districts, and still exists in the Pyrenees and the mountains ofNaples.—B.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">As far as the accounts of the sphinx are to be regarded as not entirely fabulous, we must suppose it to have originated in some species ofthe monkey tribe; perhaps the Sinlia troglodytes or chimpanzé.—B.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Of course the winged horse is an imaginary being, nor does it appearwhat is the origin of the fable; the horns are an unusual appendage tothe pegasus.—B. The pegasus and the rhinoceros together may havegiven rise to that fabulous animal, the unicorn. See, however, the Monoceros, mentioned in c. 31.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Although a hybrid animal is produced by the union of the wolf andthe dog, it does not form a permanent species. But, as Cuvier remarks,by the insertion of "velut," Pliny seems to imply that the crocotta unitesthe physical properties of the two animals. Ctesias, Indic. c. 32, gives anaccount of the cynolycus, or "dog-wolf," from which Pliny seems to havetaken his crocotta.—B.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It does not seem possible to determine what species of monkey ishere designated; it is most probable that he himself had no accurateknowledge.—B.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We may here refer to the judicious remarks of Cuvier, Ajasson, vol.vi. pp. 427, 428, and Lemaire, vol. iii. p. 399, on the leucrocotta. Itseems impossible to identify Pliny's description with any known animal, andit is not unlikely that he has confused the accounts of authors who werespeaking of different animals. Some of the characteristics of the leucrocotta agree with those of the Indian antelope, while others seem to resemble those of the hyæna.—B.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Perhaps the eale may have been the two-horned rhinoceros, as somenaturalists say that there is a degree of mobility in the horns of thatanimal; the same observation has been made with respect to the wild orforest bulls, the description of which animal, in Pliny, is probably fromDiodorus Siculus.—B.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This description of the mantichora appears to be taken from theIndica of Ctesias; it has been also adopted by Aristotle and Ælian, butthey have qualified their accounts by some expressions of doubt, which areomitted by Pliny. It has been conjectured, that Ctesias took his description from the hieroglyphic figures in his time, probably common in theEast, and still found in the ruins of the Assyrian and Persian cities, Nineveh and Persepolis, for instance.—B.</p></body>
