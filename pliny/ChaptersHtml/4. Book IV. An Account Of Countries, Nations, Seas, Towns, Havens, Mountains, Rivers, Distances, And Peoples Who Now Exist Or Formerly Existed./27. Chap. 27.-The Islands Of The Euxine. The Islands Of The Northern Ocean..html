<div2 type="chapter" n="27" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 27.—THE ISLANDS OF THE EUXINE. THE ISLANDS OF THE NORTHERNOCEAN.</head><p>But now, in conformity with the plan which I originallyproposed, the remaining portions of this gulf must be described. Asfor its seas, we have already made mention of them.</p><p>(13.) The Hellespont has no islands belonging to Europethat are worthy of mention. In the Euxine there are, at adistance of a mile and a half from the European shore, andof fourteen from the mouth of the Strait, the two Cyanæan<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>islands, by some called the Symplegades<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>, and stated infabulous story to have run the one against the other; the reasonbeing the circumstance that they are separated by so shortan interval, that while to those who enter the Euxine oppositeto them they appear to be two distinct islands, but if viewedin a somewhat oblique direction they have the appearance ofbecoming gradually united into one. On this side of theIster there is the single island<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> of the Apolloniates, eightymiles from the Thracian Bosporus; it was from this placethat M. Lucullus brought the Capitoline<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> Apollo. Those<pb n="1339" />islands which are to be found between the mouths of theIster we have already mentioned<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>. Before the Borysthenesis Achillea<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> previously referred to, known also by the namesof Leuce and Macaron<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>. Researches which have been madeat the present day place this island at a distance of 140 milesfrom the Borysthenes, of 120 from Tyra, and of fifty fromthe island of Peuce. It is about ten miles in circumference.The remaining islands in the Gulf of Carcinites are Cephalonnesos, Rhosphodusa, and Macra. Before we leave theEuxine, we must not omit to notice the opinion expressedby many writers that all the interior<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> seas take their rise inthis one as the principal source, and not at the Straits ofGades. The reason they give for this supposition is not animprobable one—the fact that the tide is always runningout of the Euxine and that there is never any ebb.</p><p>We must now leave the Euxine to describe the outerportions<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> of Europe. After passing the Riphæan mountains we<pb n="1340" />have now to follow the shores of the Northern Ocean on theleft, until we arrive at Gades. In this direction a great<pb n="1341" />number of islands<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> are said to exist that have no name; amongwhich there is one which lies opposite to Scythia, mentionedunder the name of Raunonia<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>, and said to be at a distanceof the day's sail from the mainland; and upon which, according toTimæus, amber is thrown up by the waves in the springseason. As to the remaining parts of these shores, they areonly known from reports of doubtful authority. With reference to theSeptentrional<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> or Northern Ocean; Hecatæuscalls it, after we have passed the mouth of the river Parapanisus,where it washes the Scythian shores, the Amalchian<pb n="1342" />sea, the word 'Amalchian' signifying in the language of theseraces, frozen. Philemon again says that it is called Morimarusa orthe "Dead Sea" by the Cimbri, as far as the Promontory of Rubeas,beyond which it has the name of the Cronian<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>Sea. Xenophon of Lampsacus tells us that at a distanceof three days' sail from the shores of Scythia, there is anisland of immense size called Baltia<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>, which by Pytheas iscalled Basilia<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>. Some islands<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> called Oönæ are said to be<pb n="1343" />here, the inhabitants of which live on the eggs of birdsand oats; and others again upon which human beingsare produced with the feet of horses, thence called Hippopodes. Someother islands are also mentioned as those ofthe Panotii, the people of which have ears of such extraordinary sizeas to cover the rest of the body, which isotherwise left naked.</p><p>Leaving these however, we come to the nation of theIngævones<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span>, the first in Germany; at which we begin to havesome information upon which more implicit reliance can beplaced. In their country is an immense mountain calledSevo<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span>, not less than those of the Riphæan range, and whichforms an immense gulf along the shore as far as the Promontory of the Cimbri. This gulf, which has the name of the'Codanian,' is filled with islands; the most famous amongwhich is Scandinavia<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span>, of a magnitude as yet unascertained:the only portion of it at all known is inhabited by the nationof the Hilleviones, who dwell in 500 villages, and call it asecond world: it is generally supposed that the island of<pb n="1344" />Eningia<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> is of not less magnitude. Some writers state thatthese regions, as far as the river Vistula, are inhabited by theSarmati, the Venedi<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span>, the Sciri, and the Hirri<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span>, and that thereis a gulf there known by the name of Cylipenus<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span>, at the mouthof which is the island of Latris, after which comes anothergulf, that of Lagnus, which borders on the Cimbri. TheCimbrian Promontory, running out into the sea for a greatdistance, forms a peninsula which bears the name of Cartris<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span>.Passing this coast, there are three and twenty islands whichhave been made known by the Roman arms<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span>: the mostfamous of which is Burcana<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span>, called by our people Fabaria,from the resemblance borne<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span> by a fruit which grows therespontaneously. There are those also called Glæsaria<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span> by our<pb n="1345" />soldiers, from their amber; but by the barbarians they areknown as Austeravia and Actania.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">These islands, or rather rocks, are now known as Fanari, and lie atthe entrance of the Straits of Constantinople.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From <foreign lang="greek">su\n</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">plhgh\,</foreign> "a striking together." Tournefort has explained the ancient story of these islands running together, by remarkingthat each of them consists of one craggy island, but that when the sea isdisturbed the water covers the lower parts, so as to make the differentpoints of each resemble isolated rocks. They are united to the mainlandby a kind of isthmus, and appear as islands only when it is inundated instormy weather.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Upon which the city of Apollonia (now Sizeboli), mentioned inC. 18 of the present Book, was situate.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">So called because it was dedicated by Lucullus in the Capitol.

Parisot, the Geographical Editor of Ajasson's Edition, in reference to this subject. He says, "Before entering onthe discussion of this portion of Pliny's geography, let us here observe, oncefor all, that we shall not remark as worthy of our notice all those ridiculoushypotheses which could only take their rise in ignorance, precipitation, ora love of the marvellous. We shall decline then to recognize the Doffrefelds in the mountains of Sevo, the North Cape in the Promontory ofRubeas, and the Sea of Greenland in the Cronian Sea. The absurdityof these suppositions is proved by—I. The impossibility of the ancientsever making their way to these distant coasts without the aid of largevessels, the compass, and others of those appliances, aided by which European skill finds the greatest difficulty in navigating those distant seas.II. The immense lacune which would be found to exist in thedescriptions of these distant seas and shores: for not a word do wefind aboutthose numerous archipelagos which are found scattered throughout theNorth Sea, not a word about Iceland, nor about the numberless seas andfiords on the coast of Norway. III. The absence of all remarks uponthe local phænomena of these spots. The North Cape belongs to thesecond polar climate, the longest day there being two months and a half.Is it likely that navigators would have omitted to mention this remarkablephænomenon, well known to the Romans by virtue of their astronomicaltheories, but one with which practically they had never made themselvesacquainted?—The only geographers who here merit our notice are thosewho are of opinion that in some of the coasts or islands here mentionedPliny describes the Scandinavian Peninsula, and in others the Coast ofFinland. The first question then is, to what point Pliny first carries us?It is evident that from the Black Sea he transports himself on asudden to the shores of the Baltic, thus passing over at a singleleap a considerable space filled with nations and unknown deserts.The questionthen is, what line has he followed? Supposing our author had had beforehis eyes a modern map, the imaginary line which he would have drawnin making this transition would have been from Odessa to the Kurisch-Haff. In this direction the breadth across Europe is contracted to aspace, between the two seas, not more than 268 leagues in length. Avery simple mode of reasoning will conclusively prove that Pliny hasdeviated little if anything from this route. If he fails to state in preciseterms upon what point of the shores of the Baltic he alights after leavingthe Riphæan mountains, his enumeration of the rivers which dischargethemselves into that sea, and with which he concludes his account ofGermany, will supply us with the requisite information, at all events ingreat part. In following his description of the coast, we find mentionmade of the following rivers, the Guttalus, the Vistula, the Elbe, the Weser,the Ems, the Rhine, and the Meuse. The five last mentioned follow intheir natural order, from east to west, as was to be expected in a description starting from the east of Europe for its western extremity and theshores of Cadiz. We have a right to conclude then that the Guttaluswas to the east of the Vistula. As we shall now endeavour to show,this river was no other than the Alle, a tributary of the Pregel, whichthe Romans probably, in advancing from west to east, considered as theprincipal stream, from the circumstance that they met with it, beforecoming to the larger river. The Pregel after being increased by the watersof the Alle or Guttalus falls into the Frisch-Haff, about one degreefurther west than the Kurisch-Haff. It may however be here remarked,Why not find a river more to the east, the Niemen, for instance, or theDuna, to be represented by the Guttalus? The Niemen in especial wouldsuit in every respect equally well, because it discharges itself into theKurisch-Haff. This conjecture however is incapable of support, whenwe reflect that the ancients were undoubtedly acquainted with somepoints of the coast to the east of the mouth of the Guttalus, but which,according to the system followed by our author, would form part of theContinent of Asia. These points are, 1st. The Cape Lytarinis(mentioned by Pliny, B. vi. c. 4). 2ndly. The mouth of the riverCarambucis(similarly mentioned by him), and 3rdly, a little to the east of CapeLytarmis, the mouth of the Tanais. The name of Cape Lytarmis suggeststo us Lithuania, and probably represents Domess-Ness in Courland; theCarambucis can be no other than the Niemen; while the Tanais, uponwhich so many authors, ancient and modern, have exhausted theirconjectures, from confounding it with the Southern Tanais which fallsintothe Sea of Azof, is evidently the same as the Dwina or Western Duna.This is established incontrovertibly both by its geographical position (themouth of the Dwina being only fifty leagues to the east of Domess-Ness)and the identity evidently of the names Dwina and Tanais. Long since,Leibnitz was the first to remark the presence of the radical<hi rend="ital">T. n,</hi> or <hi rend="ital">D. n,</hi>either with or without a vowel, in the names of the great rivers of EasternEurope; Danapris or Dnieper, Danaster or Dniester, Danube (in German Donau, in Hungarian Duna), Tanais or Don, for example; allwhich rivers however discharge themselves into the Black Sea. Therecan be little doubt then of the identity of the Duna with the Tanais, itbeing the only body of water in these vast countries which bears a nameresembling the initial <hi rend="ital">Tan,</hi> or <hi rend="ital">Tn,</hi> and at the same timebelongs to thebasin of the Baltic. We are aware, it is true, that the White Seareceives a river Dwina, which is commonly called the Northern Dwina,but there can be no real necessity to be at the trouble of combating theopinion that this river is identical with the Northern Tanais. As theresult then of our investigations, it is at the eastern extremity of theFrisch-Haff and near the mouth of the Pregel, that we would place thepoint at which Pliny sets out. As for the Riphæan mountains, they havenever existed anywhere but in the head of the geographers from whomour author drew his materials. From the mountains of Ural and Poias,which Pliny could not possibly have in view, seeing that they lie in ameridian as eastern as the Caspian Sea, the traveller has to proceed 600leagues to the south-west without meeting with any chains of mountainsor indeed considerable elevations."</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is pretty clear that he refers to the numerous islands scattered overthe face of the Baltic Sea, such as Dago, Oesel, Gothland, and Aland.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The old reading here was Bannomanna, which Dupinet wouldtranslate by the modern Bornholm. Parisot considers that the modernRuna,a calcareous rock covered with vegetable earth, in the vicinity of Domess-Ness, is the place indicated.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It has been suggested by Brotier that Pliny here refers to the IcySea, but it is more probable that he refers to the north-eastern part ofthe Baltic, which was looked upon by the ancients as forming part ofthe open sea.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">With reference to these divisions of land and sea, a subject which isinvolved in the greatest obscurity, Parisot states it as his opinion thatthe Amalchian or Icy Sea is that portion of the Baltic which extendsfrom Cape Rutt to Cape Grinea, while on the other hand the CronianSea comprehends all the gulfs which lie to the east of Cape Rutt, suchas the Haff, the gulfs of Stettin and Danzic, the Frisch-Haff, and the Kurisch-Haff. He also thinks that the name of 'Cronian' originally belongedonly to that portion of the Baltic which washes the coast of Courland,but that travellers gradually applied the term to the whole of the sea.He is also of opinion that the word "Cronium" owes its origin to theTeutonic and Danish adjective <hi rend="ital">groen</hi> or "green." The extreme verdurewhich characterizes the islands of the Danish archipelago has given tothe piece of water which separates the islands of Falster and Moen thename of Groensund, and it is far from improbable that the same epithetwas given to the Pomeranian and Prussian Seas, which the Romans wouldbe not unlikely to call 'Gronium' or 'Cronium fretum,' or 'Croniummare.' In the name 'Parapanisus' he also discovers a resemblance to thatof modern Pomerania.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Upon this Parisot remarks that on leaving Cape Rutt, at a distanceof about twenty-five leagues in a straight line, we come to the island ofFunen or Fyen, commonly called Fionia, the most considerable of theDanish archipelago next to Zealand, and which lying between the twoBelts, the Greater and the Smaller, may very probably from that circumstance have obtained the name of Baltia. Brotier takes Baltia tobe no other than Nova Zembla—so conflicting are the opinions ofcommentators!</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Parisot suggests that under this name may possibly lie concealedthat of the modern island of Zealand or Seeland, and that it may haveborne on the side of it next to the Belt the name of Baltseeland, easilycorrupted by the Greeks into Basilia.</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Brotier takes these to be the islands of Aloo, and Bieloi or Ostrow,at the mouth of the river Paropanisus, which he considers to be the sameas the Obi. Parisot on the other hand is of opinion that islands of theBaltic are here referred to; that from the resemblance of the name Oönæto the Greek <foreign lang="greek">w)o\n,</foreign> "an egg," the story that the nativessubsisted on theeggs of birds was formed; that not improbably the group of the Hippopodes resembled the shape of a horse-shoe, from which the story men-tioned by Pliny took its rise; and that the Fanesii (or, as the reading herehas it, the Panotii, "all-ears") wore their hair very short, from whichcircumstance their ears appeared to be of a larger size than usual.</p><p><span id="note_17"><a href="#ref_17">17. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Tacitus speaks of three great groups of the German tribes, the Ingævones forming the first thereof, and consisting of those which dwelt onthe margin of the ocean, the Hermiones in the interior, and the Istævonesin the east and south of Germany. We shall presently find that Plinyadds two groups, the Vandili as the fourth, and the Peucini and Basternæas the fifth. This classification however is thought to originate in a mistake, for Zeuss has satisfactorily shown that the Vandili belonged to theHermiones, and that Peucini and Basternæ are only names of individualtribes and not of groups of tribes.</p><p><span id="note_18"><a href="#ref_18">18. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Brotier and other geographers are of opinion that by this name thechain of the Doffrefeld mountains is meant; but this cannot be the caseif we suppose with Parisot that Pliny here returns south from theScandinavian islands and takes his departure from Cape Rutt in theterritoryof the Ingævones. Still, it is quite impossible to say what mountains hewould designate under the name of Sevo. Parisot suggests that it is a formof the compound word "seevohner," "inhabitants of the sea," and that itis a general name for the elevated lands along the margin of thesea-shore.</p><p><span id="note_19"><a href="#ref_19">19. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Parisot supposes that under this name the isle of Funen is meant,but it is more generally thought that Norway and Sweden are thus designated, as that peninsula was generally looked upon as an island by theancients. The Codanian Gulf was the sea to the east of the CimbrianChersonesus or Jutland, filled with the islands which belong to the modernkingdom of Denmark. It was therefore the southern part of the Baltic.</p><p><span id="note_20"><a href="#ref_20">20. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">By Eningia Hardouin thinks that the country of modern Finland ismeant. Poinsinet thinks that under the name are included Ingria,Livonia, and Courland; while Parisot seems inclined to be of opinionthatunder this name the island of Zealand is meant, a village of which, aboutthree-fourths of a league from the western coast, according to him, stillbears the name of Heinïnge.</p><p><span id="note_21"><a href="#ref_21">21. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Parisot is of opinion that the Venedi, also called Vinidæ andVindili, were of Sclavish origin, and situate on the shores of theBaltic. Heremarks that this people, in the fifth century, founded in Pomerania, whenquitted by the Goths, a kingdom, the chiefs of which styled themselvesthe Konjucs of Vinland. Their name is also to be found in Venden, aRussian town in the government of Riga, in Windenburg in Courland, andin Wenden in the circle of the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg Schwerin.</p><p><span id="note_22"><a href="#ref_22">22. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Parisot remarks that these two peoples were probably only tribesof the Venedi.</p><p><span id="note_23"><a href="#ref_23">23. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Parisot feels convinced that Pliny is speaking here of the Gulf ofTravemunde, the island of Femeren, and then of the gulf which extendsfrom that island to Kiel, where the Eider separates Holstein fromJutland. On the other hand, Hardouin thinks that by the Gulf ofCylipenus the Gulf of Riga is meant, and that Latris is the modernisland ofOësel. But, as Parisot justly remarks, to put this construction onPliny'slanguage is to invert the order in which he has hitherto proceeded,evidently from east to west.</p><p><span id="note_24"><a href="#ref_24">24. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The modern Cape of Skagen on the north of Jutland.</p><p><span id="note_25"><a href="#ref_25">25. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">When Drusus held the command in Germany, as we learn fromStrabo, B. vii.</p><p><span id="note_26"><a href="#ref_26">26. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is generally agreed that this is the modern island of Borkhum, atthe mouth of the river Amaiius or Ems.</p><p><span id="note_27"><a href="#ref_27">27. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">To a bean, from which (<hi rend="ital">faba</hi>) the island had its name of Fabaria.In confirmation of this Hardouin states, that in his time there was atower still standing there which was called by the natives <hi rend="ital">Hetboon huys,</hi> "the bean house."</p><p><span id="note_28"><a href="#ref_28">28. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From the word <hi rend="ital">gles</hi> or <hi rend="ital">glas,</hi> which primarily means'glass,' and thenfiguratively "amber." Probably Œland and Gothland. They will befound again mentioned in the Thirtieth Chapter of the present Book.See p. 351.</p></body>
