It is administered, too, in wine, mixedwith frankincense: taken in any other form, it is productiveof abortion. A staff, by the aid of which a person has parted<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>a frog from a snake, will accelerate parturition. Ashes of thetroxallis,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> applied with honey, act as an emmenagogue; thesame, too, with the spider that descends as it spins its threadfrom aloft; it must be taken, however, in the hollow of thehand, crushed, and applied accordingly: if, on the contrary,the spider is taken while ascending, it will arrest menstruation.</p><p>The stone aëtites,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> that is found in the eagle's nest, preservesthe fœtus against all insidious attempts at producing abortion.A vulture's feather, placed beneath the feet of the woman,accelerates parturition. It is a well-known fact, that pregnantwomen must be on their guard against ravens' eggs, for if afemale in that state should happen to step over one, she willbe sure to miscarry by the mouth.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> A hawk's dung, taken inhonied: wine, would appear to render females fruitful. Goose-grease, or that of the swan, acts emolliently upon indurationsand abscesses of the uterus.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ajasson has wasted ten lines of indignation upon the question wheresuch a staff is to be found!</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See c. 16 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxxvi. c. 39.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">An impossibility.
