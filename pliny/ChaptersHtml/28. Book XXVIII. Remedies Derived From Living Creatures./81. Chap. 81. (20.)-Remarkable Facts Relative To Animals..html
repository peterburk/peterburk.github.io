<div2 type="chapter" n="81" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 81. (20.)—REMARKABLE FACTS RELATIVE TO ANIMALS.</head><p>In addition to those already mentioned, there are variousother marvellous facts related, with reference to these animals.When a horse-shoe becomes detached from the hoof, as oftenis the case, if a person takes it up and puts it by, it will act asa remedy for hiccup the moment he calls to mind the spotwhere he has placed it. A wolf's liver, they say, is similar toa horse's hoof in appearance; and a horse, they tell us, ifit follows in the track of a wolf, will burst<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> asunder beneathits rider. The pastern-bones of swine have a certain tendencyto promote discord, it is said. In cases of fire, if some of thedung can be brought away from the stalls, both sheep andoxen may be got out all the more easily, and will make no attempt to return. The flesh of a he-goat will lose its ranksmell, if the animal has eaten barley-bread, or drunk an infusion of laser<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> the day on which it was killed. Meat thathas been salted while the moon was on the wane, will neverbe attacked by worms. In fact, so great has been the caretaken to omit no possible researches, that a deaf hare, we find,will grow fat<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> sooner than one that can hear!</p><p>As to the remedies for the diseases of animals—If a beast ofburden voids blood, an injection must be used of swine's dungmixed with wine. For the maladies of oxen, a mixture of suetis used with quicksilver, and wild garlic boiled; the wholeeaten up and administered in wine. The fat, too, of a foxis employed. The liquor of boiled horse-flesh, administered intheir drink, is recommended for the cure of diseased swine:and, indeed, the maladies of all four-footed beasts may be effec-<pb n="5367" />tually treated by boiling a she-goat whole, in her skin, alongwith a bramble-frog. Poultry, they say, will never be touchedby a fox, if they have eaten the dried liver of that animal, orif the cock, when treading the hen, has had a piece of fox'sskin about his neck. The same property, too, is attributed toa weazel's gall. The oxen in the Isle of Cyprus cure themselves of gripings in the abdomen, it is said, by swallowing<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>human excrements: the feet, too, of oxen will never be wornto the quick, if their hoofs are well rubbed with tar beforethey begin work. Wolves will never approach a field, if, afterone has been caught and its legs broken and throat cut, theblood is dropped little by little along the boundaries of thefield, and the body buried on the spot from which it wasfirst dragged. The share, too, with which the first furrowin the field has been traced in the current year, should be takenfrom the plough, and placed upon the hearth of the Lares,where the family is in the habit of meeting, and left there tillit is consumed: so long as this is in doing, no wolf will attackany animal in the field.</p><p>We will now turn to an examination of those animals which,being neither tame nor wild, are of a nature peculiar to them-selves.</p><p>SUMMARY.—Remedies, narratives, and observations, onethousand six hundred and eighty-two.</p><p>ROMAN AUTHORS QUOTED.—M.
