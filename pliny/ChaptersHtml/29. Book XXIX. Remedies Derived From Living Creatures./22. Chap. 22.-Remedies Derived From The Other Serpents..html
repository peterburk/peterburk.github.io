<div2 type="chapter" n="22" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 22.—REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE OTHER SERPENTS.</head><p>In addition to these particulars, it is a well-known fact thatfor all injuries inflicted by serpents, and those even of anotherwise incurable nature, it is an excellent remedy to applythe entrails of the serpent itself to the wound; as also, thatpersons who have once swallowed a viper's liver, boiled, willnever afterwards be attacked by serpents. The snake, too,is not venomous, except, indeed, upon certain days of themonth when it is irritated by the action of the moon: it is avery useful plan to take it alive, and pound it in water, thewound inflicted by' it being fomented with the preparation.Indeed, it is generally supposed that this reptile is possessed of<pb n="5397" />numerous other remedial properties, as we shall have occasionmore fully to mention from time to time: hence it is that thesnake is consecrated to Æsculapius.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> As for Democritus, hehas given some monstrous preparations from snakes, by the aidof which the language of birds, he says, may be understood.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span></p><p>The Æsculapian snake was first brought to Rome fromEpidaurus,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> but at the present day it is very commonly rearedin our houses<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> even; so much so, indeed, that if the breedwere not kept down by the frequent conflagrations, it wouldbe impossible to make head against the rapid increase of them.But the most beautiful of all the snakes are those which areof an amphibious nature. These snakes are known as"hydri,"<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> or water-snakes: in virulence their venom is inferior to that of no other class of serpents, and their liver ispreserved as a remedy for the ill effects of their sting.</p><p>A pounded scorpion neutralizes the venom of the spottedlizard.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> From this last animal, too, there is a noxious preparationmade; for it has been found that wine in which it has beendrowned, covers the face of those who drink it with morphew.Hence it is that females, when jealous of a rival's beauty, arein the habit of stifling a spotted lizard in the unguents whichthey use. In such a case, the proper remedy is yolk of egg,honey, and nitre. The gall of a spotted lizard, beaten up inwater, attracts weasels, they say.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The god of Medicine.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A favourite reverie with the learned of the East.
