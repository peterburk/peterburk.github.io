<div2 type="chapter" n="21" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 21. (8.)—REMEDIES FOR URINARY CALCULI ANDAFFECTIONS OF THE BLADDER.</head><p>For the cure of urinary calculi, it is a good plan to rub<pb n="5444" />the abdomen with mouse-dung. The flesh of a hedge-hog isagreeable eating, they say, if killed with a single blow uponthe head, before it has had time to discharge its urine<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> uponits body: [persons<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> who eat this flesh, it is said, will never byany possibility suffer from strangury.] The flesh of a hedgehog thus killed, is a cure for urinary obstructions of the bladder; and the same, too, with fumigations made therewith. If,on the other hand, the animal has discharged its urine upon itsbody, those who eat the flesh will be sure to be attacked bystrangury, it is said. As a lithontriptic,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> earth-worms arerecommended, taken in ordinary wine or raisin wine; or elseboiled snails, prepared the same way<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> as for the cure of asthma.For the cure of urinary obstructions, snails are taken from theshells, pounded, and administered in one cyathus of wine, threethe first day, two the second, and one the third. For the expulsion of calculi, the empty shells are reduced to ashes andtaken in drink: the liver also of a water-snake, and the ashesof burnt scorpions are similarly employed, or are taken withbread or eaten with a locust. For the same purpose, thesmall grits that are found in the gizzard of poultry or in thecraw of the ringdove, are beaten up and sprinkled in thepatient's drink; the craw, too, of poultry is taken, dried, or iffresh, grilled.</p><p>For urinary calculi and other obstructions of the bladder,dung of ring-doves is taken, with beans; ashes also of wildring-doves' feathers, mixed with vinegar and honey; the intestines of those birds, reduced to ashes, and administered indoses of three spoonfuls; a small clod from a swallow's nest,dissolved in warm water; the dried crop of an ossifrage; thedung of a turtle-dove, boiled in honied wine; or the broth ofa boiled turtle-dove.</p><p>It is very beneficial also for urinary affections to eat thrusheswith myrtle-berries, or grasshoppers grilled on a shallow-pan;or else to take the millepedes, known as "onisci,"<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> in drink.For pains in the bladder, a decoction of lambs' feet is used.<pb n="5445" />Chicken-broth relaxes the bowels and mollifies acridities;swallows' dung, too, with honey, employed as a suppository,acts as a purgative.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. viii. c. 56.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This passage is omitted by Sillig as an evident interpolation from thecontext a couple of lines below.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The belief in lithontriptics can hardly be said to exist at the presentday.
