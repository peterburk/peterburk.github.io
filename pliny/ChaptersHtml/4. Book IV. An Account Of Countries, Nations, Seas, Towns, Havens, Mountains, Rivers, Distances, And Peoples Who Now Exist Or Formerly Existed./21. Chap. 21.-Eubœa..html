<div2 type="chapter" n="21" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 21.—EUBŒA.</head><p>Eubœa<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> itself has also been rent away from Bœotia; thechannel of the Euripus, which flows between them, being sonarrow as to admit of the opposite shores being united bya bridge<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>. At the south, this island is remarkable for itstwo promontories, that of Geræstus<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>, which looks towardsAttica, and that of Caphareus<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, which faces the Hellespont;on the north it has that of Cenæum<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>. In no part doesthis island extend to a greater breadth than forty miles,while it never contracts to less than two. In length itruns along the whole coast of Bœotia, extending fromAttica as far as Thessaly, a distance of 150 miles<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>. Incircumference it measures 365, and is distant from theHellespont, on the side of Caphareus, 225 miles. The citiesfor which it was formerly famous were, Pyrrha, Porthmos,Nesos, Cerinthos<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>, Oreum, Dium, Ædepsos<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>, Ocha, andŒchalia; at present it is ennobled by those of Chalcis<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span><pb n="1317" />(opposite which, on the mainland, is Aulis), Geræstus<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>,Eretria<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>, Carystus<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>, Oritanum, and Artemisium<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>. Here arealso the Fountain of Arethusa<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>, the river Lelantus, and thewarm springs known as Ellopiæ; it is still better known,however, for the marble of Carystus. This island usedformerly to be called Chalcodontis and Macris<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>, as we learnfrom Dionysius and Ephorus; according to Aristides, Macra;also, as Callidemus says, Chalcis, because copper was firstdiscovered here. Menæchmus says that it was calledAbantias<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span>, and the poets generally give it the name ofAsopis.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called Eubœa, as also Egripo, or Negropont,—a corruption ofthe former word and "pont," "a bridge."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hardouin speaks of this as existing in his time, <date value="1670" authname="1670">1670</date>, and being 250feet in length. It is supposed to have been first constructed aboutB.C.<date value="-411" authname="-411">411</date>, for the purpose of uninterrupted communication with Bœotia.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Capo Mandili.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Kavo Doro, or Xylofago.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Lithadha, with a mountain 2837 feet above the sea.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">These measurements are not exactly correct. The length from northto south is about ninety miles; the extreme breadth across, thirty, andin one part, not more than four miles.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Still extant in the time of Strabo, who speaks of it as an inconsiderable place.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Its site is now called Lipso. It contained warm baths sacred toHercules, and used by the Dictator Sylla. They are still to be seen.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Egripo, or Negropont, having given name to the rest of theisland. The Euripus is here only forty yards across, being crossed by abridge, partly of stone, partly of wood. The poet Lycophron and theorator Isæus were natives of this place, and Aristotle died here.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Near the promontory of that name, now Capo Mandili. In thetown there was a famous temple of Poseidon, or Neptune. Accordingto Hardouin, the modern name is Iastura.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">One of the most powerful cities of Eubœa. It was destroyed by thePersians under Darius, and a new town was built to the south of the oldone. New Eretria stood, according to Leake, at the modern Kastri, andold Eretria in the neighbourhood of Vathy. The tragic poet Achæus, acontemporary of Æschylus, was born here; and a school of philosophywas founded at this place by Menedemus, a disciple of Plato.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Karysto, on the south of the island, at the foot of MountOcha, upon which are supposed to have been its quarries of marble.There are but few remains of the ancient city. The historian Antigonus,the comic poet Apollodorus, and the physician Diocles, were natives ofthis place.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably on the promontory of the same name. It was off thiscoast that the Greek fleet engaged that of Xerxes, B.C. <date value="-480" authname="-480">480</date>.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There were tame fish kept in this fountain; and its waters weresometimes disturbed by volcanic agency. Leake says that it has nowtotally disappeared.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From the fact of its producing copper, and of its being in shape longand narrow.</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Strabo remarks, that Homer calls its inhabitants Abantes, while hegives to the island the name of Eubœa. The poets say that it took itsname from the cow (<foreign lang="greek">Bou=s</foreign>) Io, who gave birth to Epaphus on thisisland.</p></body>
