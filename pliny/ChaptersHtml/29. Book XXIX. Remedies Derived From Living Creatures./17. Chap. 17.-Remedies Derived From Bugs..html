<div2 type="chapter" n="17" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 17.—REMEDIES DERIVED FROM BUGS.</head><p>There are some things, of a most revolting nature, but which<pb n="5393" />are recommended by authors with such a degree of assurance,that it would be improper to omit them, the more particularlyas it is to the sympathy or antipathy of objects that remediesowe their existence. Thus the bug, for instance, a most filthyinsect, and one the very name of which inspires us with loathing, is said to be a neutralizer of the venom of serpents, asps inparticular, and to be a preservative against all kinds of poisons.As a proof of this, they tell us that the sting of an asp is neverfatal to poultry, if they have eaten bugs that day; and that,if such is the case, their flesh is remarkably beneficial to personswho have been stung by serpents. Of the various recipes<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>given in reference to these insects, the least revolting are theapplication of them externally to the wound, with the blood ofa tortoise; the employment of them as a fumigation to makeleeches loose their hold; and the administering of them to animals in drink when a leech has been accidentally swallowed.Some persons, however, go so far as to crush bugs with saltand woman's milk, and anoint the eyes with the mixture; incombination, too, with honey and oil of roses, they use themas an injection for the ears. Field-bugs, again, and those foundupon the mallow,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> are burnt, and the ashes mixed with oilof roses as an injection for the ears.</p><p>As to the other remedial virtues attributed to bugs, for thecure of vomiting, quartan fevers, and other diseases, althoughwe find recommendations given to swallow them in an egg,some wax, or in a bean, I look upon them as utterly unfounded,and not worthy of further notice. They are employed, however, for the treatment of lethargy, and with some fair reason,as they successfully neutralize the narcotic effects of the poisonof the asp: for this purpose seven of them are administeredin a cyathus of water, but in the case of children only four.In cases, too, of strangury, they have been injected into theurinary channel:<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> so true it is that Nature, that universalparent, has engendered nothing without some powerful reasonor other. In addition to these particulars, a couple of bugs,<pb n="5394" />it is said, attached to the left arm in some wool that has beenstolen from the shepherds, will effectually cure nocturnal fevers;while those recurrent in the daytime may be treated withequal success by enclosing the bugs in a piece of russet-colouredcloth. The scolopendra, on the other hand, is a great enemyto these insects; used in the form of a fumigation, it killsthem.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Guettard, a French commentator on Pliny, recommends bugs to betaken internally for hysteria!</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Perhaps the Cimex pratensis is meant here.
