The people of Africa arein the habit of neutralizing such acidity<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> as may be foundwith gypsum, and in some parts with lime. The people ofGreece, on the other hand, impart briskness to their wineswhen too flat, with potters' earth, pounded marble, salt, orsea-water; while in Italy, again, brown pitch is used for thatpurpose in some parts, and it is the universal practice boththere as well as in the adjoining provinces to season their newwines with resin: sometimes, too, they season them with oldwine-lees or vinegar<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> They make various medicaments, also,for this purpose with the must itself. They boil it down tillit becomes quite sweet, and has lost a considerable portion ofits strength; though thus prepared, they say it will never lastbeyond a single year. In some places they boil down themust till it becomes sapa,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and then mix it with their winesfor the purpose of modifying their harshness. Both forthese kinds of wines, as, indeed, all others, they always employvessels which have themselves received an inner coat of pitch;the method of preparing them will be set forth in a succeedingBook.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxiii. c. 24, and B. xxxvi. c. 48.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A process very likely, as Fée remarks, to turn the wines speedily tovinegar.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Down to one-third.
