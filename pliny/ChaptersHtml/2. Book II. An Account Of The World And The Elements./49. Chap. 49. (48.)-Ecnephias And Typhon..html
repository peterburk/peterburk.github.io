(48.)ÑECNEPHIAS AND TYPHON.</head><p>And now respecting the sudden gusts<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>, which arising fromthe exhalations of the earth, as has been said above, andfalling down again, being in the mean time covered by athin film of clouds, exist in a variety of forms. By theirwandering about, and rushing down like torrents, in theopinion of some persons, they produce thunder and lightning<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>. But ifthey be urged on with greater force andviolence, so as to cause the rupture of a dry cloud, they produce asquall<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>, which is named by the Greeks Ecnephias<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>.But, if these are compressed, and rolled up more closely together,and then break without any discharge of fire, i. e.without thunder, they produce a squall, which is namedTyphon<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>, or an Ecnephias in a state of agitation. It carriesalong a portion of the cloud which it has broken off, rollingit and turning it round, aggravating its own destruction bythe weight of it, and whirling it from place to place. Thisis very much dreaded by sailors, as it not only breaks theirsail-yards, but the vessels themselves, bending them aboutin various ways. This may be in a slight degree counteracted bysprinkling it with vinegar, when it comes near us,this substance being of a very cold nature<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>. This wind,when it rebounds after the stroke, absorbs and carries upwhatever it may have seized on.<pb n="1080" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"flatus repentini."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cicero refers to an opinion very similar to this as maintained by theStoics; De Div. ii. 44.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"procella."</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"<foreign lang="greek">e)k ne/fous,</foreign> erumpente spiritu."

Qu¾st. iii. 5, refers to the extraordinary power ofvinegar in extinguishing fire, but he ascribes this effect, not toits coldness, but to the extreme tenuity of its parts.
