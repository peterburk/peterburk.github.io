<div2 type="chapter" n="41" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 41. (29.)ÑPLACES IN WHICH CERTAIN BIRDS ARE NEVERFOUND.</head><p>With reference to the departure of birds, the owlet, too, issaid to lie concealed for a few days. No birds of this last kindare to be found in the island of Crete, and if any are importedthither, they immediately die. Indeed, this is a remarkabledistinction made by Nature; for she denies to certain places,as it were, certain kinds of fruits and shrubs, and of animals as<pb n="2508" />well; it is singular that when introduced into these localitiesthey will be no longer productive, but die immediately theyare thus transplanted. What can it be that is thus fatal tothe increase of one particular species, or whence this envymanifested against them by Nature? What, too, are the limitsthat have been marked out for the birds on the face of theearth?</p><p>Rhodes<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> possesses no eagles. In Italy beyond the Padus,there is, near the Alps, a lake known by the name of Larius,beautifully situate amid a country covered with shrubs; andyet this lake is never visited by storks, nor, indeed, are theyever known to come within eight miles of it; while, on theother hand, in the neighbouring territory of the Insubres<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>there are immense flocks of magpies and jackdaws, the only<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>bird that is guilty of stealing gold and silver, a very singularpropensity.</p><p>It is said that in the territory of Tarentum, the woodpeckerof Mars is never found. It is only lately too, and that butvery rarely, that various kinds of pies have begun to be seenin the districts that lie between the Apennines and the City;birds which are known by the name of "vari¾,"<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and are remarkable for the length of the tail. It is a peculiarity ofthis bird, that it becomes bald every year at the time of sowingrape. The partridge does not fly beyond the frontiers ofBÏotia, into Attica; nor does any bird, in the island<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> in theEuxine in which Achilles was buried, enter the temple thereconsecrated to him. In the territory of Fiden¾, in the vicinityof the City, the storks have no young nor do they build nests: butvast numbers of ringdoves arrive from beyond sea every yearin the district of Volaterr¾. At Rome, neither flies nor dogsever enter the temple of Hercules in the Cattle Market. Thereare numerous other instances of a similar nature in referenceto all kinds of animals, which from time to time I feel myself prompted by prudent considerations to omit, lest I should<pb n="2509" />only weary the reader. Theophrastus, for example, relatesthat even pigeons, as well as peacocks and ravens, have beenintroduced from other parts into Asia,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> as also croaking frogs<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>into Cyrenaica.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Suetonius says, that when Tiberius was staying at Rhodes, an eagleperched on the roof of his house; such a bird having never been seenbefore on the island.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. iii. c. 21.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is still noted for its thieving propensities; witness the English storyof the Maid and the Magpie, and the Italian opera of "La Gazza Ladra."Cicero says, "They would no more trust gold with you, than with a jackdaw." See also Ovid's Met. B. vii. It is the Corvus pica of Linn¾us.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Mottled pics."</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. iv. c. 12.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Asia Minor, most probably.
