<div2 type="chapter" n="58" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 58.—ARGENTARIA. NAMES OF FREEDMEN WHO HAVEEITHER RISEN TO POWER THEMSELVES, OR HAVE BELONGED TOMEN OF INFLUENCE.</head><p>There is another cretaceous earth, known as "argentaria,"<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>from the brightness<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> which it imparts to silver. There is alsothe most inferior kind of chalk; which was used by theancients for tracing the line of victory<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> in the Circus, and formarking the feet of slaves on sale, that were brought frombeyond sea. Such, for instance, were Publilius<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> Lochius, the<pb n="6302" />founder of our mimic scenes; his cousin, Manilius Antiochus,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>the first cultivator of astronomy; and Staberius Eros, our firstgrammarian; all three of whom our ancestors saw broughtover in the same ship<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span></p><p>(18.) But why mention these names, recommended as they areby the literary honours which they acquired? Other instancestoo, Rome has beheld of persons rising to high positions fromthe slave-market;<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> Chrysogonus, for example, the freedmanof Sylla; Amphion, the freedman of Q. Catulus; the man whowas the keeper<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> of Lucullus; Demetrius, the freedman of Pompeius,and Auge, the freedwoman of Demetrius,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> or else ofPompeius himself, as some have supposed; Hipparchus, thefreedman of M. Antonius; as also, Menas<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> and Menecrates,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>freedmen of Sextus Pompeius, and many others as well, whomit would be superfluous to enumerate, and who have enrichedthemselves at the cost of Roman blood, and the licence thatresults from proscription.</p><p>Such is the mark that is set upon those droves of slaveswhich we see on sale, such the opprobrium thrown upon themby a capricious fortune ! And yet, some of these very men havewe beheld in the enjoyment of such power and influence, thatthe senate itself has decreed them—at the command of Agrippina,<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>wife of the Emperor Claudius—the decorations even ofthe prætorship: all but honoured with the fasces and theirlaurels, in fact, and sent back in state to the very place fromwhich they originally came, with their feet whitened with theslave-dealer's chalk!<pb n="6303" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Plate powder; from "argentum," "silver."

It is more probable, however,that he was the father of the poet, or perhaps the grandfather; as itis clear from a passage in Suetonius, that Staberius Eros taught at Romeduring the civil wars of Sylla, while the poem must have been written, inpart at least, after the death of Augustus.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Being afterwards manumitted.
