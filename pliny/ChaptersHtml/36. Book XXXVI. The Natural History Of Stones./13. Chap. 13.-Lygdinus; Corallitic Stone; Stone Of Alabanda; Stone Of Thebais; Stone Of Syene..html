<div2 type="chapter" n="13" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 13.—LYGDINUS; CORALLITIC STONE; STONE OF ALABANDA;STONE OF THEBAIS; STONE OF SYENE.</head><p>Little inferior to it for the preservation of unguents, in theopinion of many, is the stone, called "lygdinus,"<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> that isfound in Paros, and never of a larger size than to admit of adish or goblet being made of it. In former times, it was onlyimported from Arabia, being remarkable for its extremewhiteness.</p><p>Great value is placed also upon two other kinds of stone, ofquite a contrary nature; corallitic<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> stone, found in Asia, in blocksnot more than two cubits in thickness, and of a white some-whatapproaching that of ivory, and in some degree resemblingit; and Alabandic stone, which, on the other hand, is black,and is so called from the district<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> which produces it: though<pb n="6331" />it is also to be found at Miletus, where, however, it vergessomewhat more upon the purple. It admits of being meltedby the action of fire, and is fused for the preparation of glass.</p><p>Thebaic stone, which is sprinkled all over with spots likegold, is found in Africa, on the side of it which lies adjacentto Egypt; the small hones which it supplies being peculiarlyadapted, from their natural properties, for grinding the ingredientsused in preparations for the eyes. In the neighbourhoodof Syene, too, in Thebais, there is a stone foundthat is now known as "syenites,"<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> but was formerly called"pyrrhopœcilon."<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">By some persons it has been considered to be the same with the "lychnitis,"or white marble, mentioned in Chapter 4 of this Book. Ajassonis of opinion that it has not been identified.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ajasson is in doubt whether this stone was really a marble or a gypsicalabaster. It received its name from the river Curalius or Coural, nearwhich it was found; and it was also known as Sangaric marble. Ajassonthinks that the ancient milk-white marble, still found in Italy, and knownto the dealers in antiquities as <hi rend="ital">Palombino,</hi> may have been the "corallitic"stone. He also mentions the fine white marble known as <hi rend="ital">Grechetto.</hi></p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. v. c. 29. Sulphuret of manganese is now known as Alabandine;it is black, but becomes of a tarnished brown on exposure to theair. It is not improbable that this manganese was used for colouringglass, and that in Chapter 66 of this Book Pliny again refers to manganesewhen speaking of a kind of "magnet" or load-stone. See Beckmann,Hist. Inv. Vol. pp. 237–8, <hi rend="ital">Bohn's Edition;</hi> who thinks, thatin the present passage Pliny is speaking of a kind of marble. It isthe fact, however, that Pyrolusite, or grey ore of manganese, is used, at ared heat, for discharging the brown and green tints of glass. See also B.xxxiv. c. 42, and the Note.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Syenite is the name still given to feldspar, hornblende, and quartz,passing into each other by insensible gradations, and resembling granite.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Varied with red spots," similar to our red granite.</p></body>
