<div2 type="chapter" n="62" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 62.—PIPERITIS, LIBANOTIS, AND SMYRNIUM.</head><p>To come to a full understanding, too, both here as elsewhere,how unfounded are the notions which are generally entertained,I shall take this opportunity of remarking that panax<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> has theflavour of pepper, and siliquastrum even more so, a circum-stance to which it owes its name of piperitis:<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> libanotis<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>again, has just the odour of frankincense, and smyrnium<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> ofmyrrh. As to panax, we have spoken of it at sufficient lengthalready.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> Libanotis grows in a thin, crumbly soil, and isgenerally sown in spots exposed to the falling dews; the root,which is just like that of olusatrum,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> has a smell in no waydiffering from that of frankincense; when a year old, it is extremelywholesome for the stomach; some persons give it thename of rosmarinum.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> Smyrnium is a garden herb that growsin similar soils, and has a root which smells like myrrh:siliquastrum, too, is grown in a similar manner.</p><p>Other plants, again, differ from the preceding ones, both insmell and taste, anise<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> for example; indeed, so great is thedifference in this respect, and in their relative virtues, that notonly are the properties of each modified by the other, but quiteneutralized even. It is in this way that our cooks correctthe flavour of vinegar in their dishes with parsley, and ourbutlers employ the same plant, enclosed in sachets, for removinga bad odour in wine.<pb n="4204" /></p><p><span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>Thus far, then, we have treated of the garden plants, viewedas articles of food only; it remains for us now (for up to thepresent we have only spoken of their various methods of culti-vation, with some succinct details relative thereto), to enlargeupon the more elaborate operations of Nature in this respect;it being quite impossible to come to a full understanding as tothe true characteristics of each individual plant, without aknowledge of its medicinal effects, a sublime and truly mysteriousmanifestation of the wisdom of the Deity, than whichnothing can possibly be found of a nature more elevated. Itis upon principle that we have thought proper not to enlargeupon the medicinal properties of each plant when treating ofit; for it is a quite different class of persons that is interestedin knowing their curative properties, and there is no doubtthat both classes of readers would have been inconvenienced ina very material degree, if these two points of view had engagedour attention at the same moment. As it is, each class willhave its own portion to refer to, while those who desire to doso, will experience no difficulty in uniting them, with referenceto any subject of which we may happen to treat.</p><p>SUMMARY.—Remarkable facts, narratives, and observations,one thousand one hundred and forty-four.</p><p>ROMAN AUTHORS QUOTED.—Maccius Plautus,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>.
