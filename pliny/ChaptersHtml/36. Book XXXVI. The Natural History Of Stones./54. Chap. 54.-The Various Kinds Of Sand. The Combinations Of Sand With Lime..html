THE COMBINATIONSOF SAND WITH LIME.</head><p>There are three kinds of sand: fossil<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> sand, to whichone-fourth part of lime should be added;<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> river sand; andsea sand; to both of which last, one third of lime should beadded. If, too, one third of the mortar is composed of bruisedearthenware, it will be all the better. Fossil sand is found inthe districts that lie between the Apennines and the Padus,but not in the parts beyond sea.<pb n="6374" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">To which Pozzuolane belongs.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">For making mortar.</p></body>
