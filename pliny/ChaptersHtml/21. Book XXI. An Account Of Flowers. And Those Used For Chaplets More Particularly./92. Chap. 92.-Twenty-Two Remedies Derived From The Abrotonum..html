<div2 type="chapter" n="92" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 92.—TWENTY-TWO REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE ABROTONUM.</head><p>We find two varieties of abrotonum<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> mentioned, the field,and the mountain kind; this last, it is generally understood,is the female plant, the other the male. They are both of thembitter, like wormwood. That of Sicily is the most esteemed,and next to it, that of Galatia. The leaves of it are sometimesemployed, but it is the seed that possesses the most warming<pb n="4378" />properties; hence it is, that it is so beneficial for maladies ofthe sinews,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> for cough, hardness of breathing, convulsions, ruptures, lumbago, and strangury. Several handfuls of this plantare boiled down to one-third, and the decoction of it, in dosesof four cyathi, is administered in drink. The seed is given,pounded, in water, in doses of one drachma; it is very goodfor affections of the uterus.</p><p>Mixed with barley-meal, this plant brings tumours to ahead, and boiled with quinces, it is employed as a liniment forinflammations of the eyes. It keeps away serpents, and fortheir stings it is either taken in wine, or else employed incombination with it as a liniment. It is extremely efficacious,also, for the stings of those noxious insects by which shiveringfits and chills are produced, such as the scorpion and the spidercalled "phalangium,"<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> for example; taken in a potion, it isgood for other kinds of poison, as also for shivering fits, however produced, and for the extraction of foreign substances adhering to the flesh; it has the effect, also, of expelling intestinal worms. It is stated that a sprig of this plant, if put beneath the pillow, will act as an aphrodisiac, and that it is ofthe very greatest efficacy against all those charms and spells bywhich impotence is produced.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See c. 34 of this Book. Both of the plants mentioned share the medicinal properties of wormwood, being stimulants, tonics, anthelmintics,and febrifuges. It would be dangerous, however, Fée says, to administerthem in most of the cases mentioned by Pliny, nor would they be good forstrangury, or affections of the chest.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Nervis." Pliny had no knowledge, probably, of the nervous system;but Fée seems to think that such is his meaning here. See B. xi. c. 88.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xi. cc. 24, 28, and 29.</p></body>
