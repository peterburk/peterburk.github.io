<div2 type="chapter" n="30" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 30.—REMEDIES FOR FEVERS.</head><p>In the treatment of quartan fevers, clinical medicine is, so tosay, pretty nearly powerless; for which reason we shall inserta considerable number of remedies recommended by professorsof the magic art, and, first of all, those prescribed to be wornas amulets: the dust, for instance, in which a hawk has bathed<pb n="5454" />itself, tied up in a linen cloth, with a red string, and attachedto the body; the longest tooth of a black dog; or the waspknown by the name of "pseudosphex,"<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> which is always tobe seen flying alone, caught with the left hand and attachedbeneath the patient's chin. Some use for this purpose thefirst wasp that a person sees in the current year. Otheramulets are, a viper's head, severed from the body and wrappedin a linen cloth; a viper's heart, removed from the reptilewhile still alive; the muzzle<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> of a mouse and the tips of itsears, wrapped in red cloth, the animal being set at libertyafter they are removed; the right eye plucked from a livinglizard, and enclosed with the head, seperated from the body,in goat's skin; the scarabænus also that forms pellets<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and rollsthem along.</p><p>It is on account of this kind of scarabæus that the peopleof a great part of Egypt worship those insects as divinities;an usage for which Apion gives a curious reason, asserting, as hedoes, by way of justifying the rites of his nation, that the, insectin its operations pictures the revolution of the sun. There isalso another kind of scarabæus, which the magicians recom-mend to be worn as an amulet—the one that has small horns<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>thrown backwards; it must be taken up, when used for thispurpose, with the left hand. A third kind also, known by thename of "fullo,"<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> and covered with white spots, they recom-mend to be cut asunder and attached to either arm, the otherkinds being worn upon the left arm. Other amulets recom-mended by them, are, the heart of a snake taken from theliving animal with the left hand; or four joints of a scorpion'stail. together with the sting,, attached to the body in a piece ofblack cloth; due care being taken that the patient does not see<pb n="5455" />the scorpion, which is set at liberty after the operation, orthe person who has attached the amulet, for the space ofthree days: after the recurrence, too, of the third paroxysm,he must bury the whole in the ground. Some enclose a caterpillar in a piece of linen with a thread passed three timesround it, and tie as many knots, repeating at each knot why itis that the patient performs that operation. A slug is sometimes wrapped in a piece of skin, or the heads of four slugs,cut from the body with a reed: a millepede is rolled up inwool: the small grubs that produce the gadfly,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> are usedbefore the wings of the insect are developed; or any other kindof hairy grub is employed that is found adhering to pricklyshrubs. Some persons attach to the body four of these grubs,enclosed in an empty walnut shell, or else some of the snailsthat are found without a shell.</p><p>In other cases, again, it is the practice to enclose a spottedlizard in a little box, and to place it beneath the pillow, of thepatient, taking care to set it at liberty when the fever abates.It is recommended also, that the patient should swallow theheart of a sea-diver, removed from the bird without the aid ofiron, it being first dried and then bruised and taken in warmwater. The heart of a swallow is also recommended, withhoney; and there are persons who say that, just before theparoxysms come on, the patient should take one drachma ofswallow's dung in three cyathi of goats' milk or ewes' milk,or of raisin wine: others, again, are of opinion that the birdsthemselves should be taken, whole. The nations of Parthia,as a remedy for quartan fevers, take the skin of the asp, indoses of one sixth of a denarius, with an equal quantity ofpepper. The philosopher Chrysippus has left a statement tothe effect, that the phryganion,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> worn as an amulet, is aremedy for quartan fevers; but what kind of animal this is hehas nowhere informed us, nor have I been able to meet withany one who knows. Still, however, I felt myself bound tonotice a remedy that was mentioned by an author of such highrepute, in case any other person should happen to be moresuccessful in his researches. To eat the flesh of a crow, and<pb n="5456" />to use nitre in the form of a liniment, is considered highlyefficacious for the treatment of chronic diseases.</p><p>In cases of tertian fever—so true it is that suffering takesdelight in prolonging hope by trying every remedy—it may beworth while to make trial whether the web of the spider called"lycos"<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> is of any use, applied, with the insect itself, to thetemples and forehead in a compress covered with resin and wax;or the insect itself, attached to the body in a reed, a form inwhich it is said to be highly beneficial for other fevers. Trialmay be made also of a green lizard, enclosed alive in a vesseljust large enough to receive it, and worn as an amulet; amethod, it is said, by which recurrent fevers are often dispelled.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Bastard-wasp."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Rostellum."

It was supposed that there was no female scarabæus,and that the male insect formed these balls for the reproduction of itsspecies. It figures very largely in the Egyptian mythology and philosophyas the emblem of the creative and generative power.
