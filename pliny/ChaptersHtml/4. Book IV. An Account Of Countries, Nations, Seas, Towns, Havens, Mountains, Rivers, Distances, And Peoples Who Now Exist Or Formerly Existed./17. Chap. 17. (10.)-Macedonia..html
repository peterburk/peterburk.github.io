Pæonia and Pelagonia protect its northern parts from the Triballi<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>. Its<pb n="1298" />towns are Ægiæ<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>, at which place its kings were usuallyburied, Beræa<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>, and, in the country called Pieria from thegrove of that name, Æginium<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>.

Next comes Antigonea<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span>, Europus<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> uponthe river Axius, and another place of the same name bywhich the Rhœmdias flows, Scydra, Eordæa, Mieza, and Gordyniæ.Then, upon the coast, Ichne<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span>, and the river Axius:along this frontier the Dardani, the Treres<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span>, and the Pieres,border on Macedonia.

Upon the Gulf<span id="ref_44"><a href="#note_44">[44]</a></span> of Thermæ are thetowns of Dicæa, Pydna<span id="ref_45"><a href="#note_45">[45]</a></span>, Derra, Scione<span id="ref_46"><a href="#note_46">[46]</a></span>, the Promontory ofCanastræum<span id="ref_47"><a href="#note_47">[47]</a></span>, and the towns of Pallene<span id="ref_48"><a href="#note_48">[48]</a></span> and Phlegra. In thisregion also are the mountains Hypsizorus, Epitus, Halcyone,and Leoomne; the towns of Nyssos<span id="ref_49"><a href="#note_49">[49]</a></span>, Phryxelon, Mendæ, andwhat was formerly Potidæa<span id="ref_50"><a href="#note_50">[50]</a></span> on the isthmus of Pallene, butnow the Colony of Cassandria; Anthemus<span id="ref_51"><a href="#note_51">[51]</a></span>, Olophyxus<span id="ref_52"><a href="#note_52">[52]</a></span>, andthe Gulf of Mecyberna<span id="ref_53"><a href="#note_53">[53]</a></span>; the towns of Miscella, Ampelos<span id="ref_54"><a href="#note_54">[54]</a></span>,Torone<span id="ref_55"><a href="#note_55">[55]</a></span>, Singos<span id="ref_56"><a href="#note_56">[56]</a></span>, and the canal, a mile and a half in length,by means of which Xerxes, king of the Persians, cut off MountAthos<span id="ref_57"><a href="#note_57">[57]</a></span> from the main land. This mountain projects from<pb n="1301" />the level plain of the adjacent country into the sea, a distanceof seventy-five<span id="ref_58"><a href="#note_58">[58]</a></span> miles; its circumference at its base being 150miles in extent. There was formerly upon its summit thetown of Acroathon<span id="ref_59"><a href="#note_59">[59]</a></span>: the present towns are Uranopolis<span id="ref_60"><a href="#note_60">[60]</a></span>,Palæorium, Thyssus, Cleonæ<span id="ref_61"><a href="#note_61">[61]</a></span>, and Apollonia, the inhabitantsof which have the surname of Macrobii<span id="ref_62"><a href="#note_62">[62]</a></span>. The town also ofCassera, and then the other side of the Isthmus, after whichcome Acanthus<span id="ref_63"><a href="#note_63">[63]</a></span>, Stagira<span id="ref_64"><a href="#note_64">[64]</a></span>, Sithone<span id="ref_65"><a href="#note_65">[65]</a></span>,Heraclea<span id="ref_66"><a href="#note_66">[66]</a></span>, and the country of Mygdonia that lies below, inwhich are situate, at somedistance from the sea, Apollonia<span id="ref_67"><a href="#note_67">[67]</a></span> and Arethusa. Again, uponthe coast we have Posidium<span id="ref_68"><a href="#note_68">[68]</a></span>, and the bay with the town ofCermorus, Amphipolis<span id="ref_69"><a href="#note_69">[69]</a></span>, a free town, and the nation of the<pb n="1302" />Bisaltæ. We then come to the river Strymon<span id="ref_70"><a href="#note_70">[70]</a></span> which takesits rise in Mount Hæmus<span id="ref_71"><a href="#note_71">[71]</a></span> and forms the boundary of Macedonia: it is worthy of remark that it first discharges itselfinto seven lakes before it proceeds onward in its course.</p><p>Such is Macedonia, which was once the mistress of theworld, which once extended<span id="ref_72"><a href="#note_72">[72]</a></span> her career over Asia, Armenia,Iberia, Albania, Cappadocia, Syria, Egypt, Taurus, and Caucasus, which reduced the whole of the East under her power,and triumphed over the Bactri, the Medes, and the Persians.She too it was who proved the conqueror of India, thustreading in the footsteps of Father Liber<span id="ref_73"><a href="#note_73">[73]</a></span> and of Hercules;and this is that same Macedonia, of which our own generalPaulus Æmilius sold to pillage seventy-two<span id="ref_74"><a href="#note_74">[74]</a></span> cities in one day.So great the difference in her lot resulting from the actionsof two<span id="ref_75"><a href="#note_75">[75]</a></span> individuals!</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Philip, the Conqueror of Greece, and Alexander, the Conqueror ofAsia.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The original Emathia, as mentioned by Homer, is coupled withPieria as lying between the Hellenic cities of Thessaly and Pæonia, andThrace.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A tribe of the south-west of Mœsia, and extending over a part ofIllyricum.
