<div2 type="chapter" n="19" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 19.—MOLON OR SYRON. AMOMUM.</head><p>Molon<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> is a plant with a striated stem, a soft diminutiveleaf, and a root four fingers in length, at the extremity ofwhich there is a head like that of garlic; by some persons itis known as "syron." Taken in wine, it is curative of affections of the stomach, and of hardness of breathing. For similarpurposes the greater centaury is used, in an electuary; juicealso of plantago, or else the plant itself, eaten with the food;pounded betony, in the proportion of one pound to half anounce of Attic honey, taken daily in warm water; and aristolochia<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> or agaric, taken in doses of three oboli, in warm wateror asses' milk.</p><p>For hardness of breathing an infusion of cissanthemos<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> istaken in drink, and for the same complaint, as also for asthma,hyssop. For pains in the liver, chest, and side, if unattendedwith fever, juice of peucedanum is used. For spitting ofblood agaric is employed, in doses of one victoriatus,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> bruisedand administered in five cyathi of honied. wine: amomum,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>too, is equally useful for that purpose. For liver diseases in<pb n="5166" />particular, teucria<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> is taken fresh, in doses of four drachmeto one hemina of oxycrate; or else betony, in the proportionof one drachma to three cyathi of warm water. For diseasesor the heart, betony is recommended, in doses of one drachmato two cyathi of cold water. Juice of cinquefoil is remedialfor diseases of the liver and lungs, and for spitting of blood aswell as all internal affections of the blood. The two varietiesof anagallis<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> are wonderfully efficacious for liver complaints.Patients who eat the plant called "capnos"<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> discharge thebile by urine. Acoron<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> is also remedial for diseases of the liver,and daucus<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> is useful for the thorax and the pectoral organs.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Possibly the same plant as the "Moly" of B. xxv. c. 8.
