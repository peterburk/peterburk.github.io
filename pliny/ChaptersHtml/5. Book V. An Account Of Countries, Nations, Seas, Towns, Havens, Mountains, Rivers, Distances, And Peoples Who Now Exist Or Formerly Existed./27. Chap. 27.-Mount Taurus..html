<div2 type="chapter" n="27" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 27.—MOUNT TAURUS.</head><p>Adjoining to Pamphylia is the Sea of Lycia and the countryof Lycia<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> itself, where the chain of Taurus, coming fromthe eastern shores, terminates the vast Gulf<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> by the Promontoryof Chelidonium<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>. Of immense extent, and separatingnations innumerable, after taking its first rise at the IndianSea<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, it branches off to the north on the right-hand side,and on the left towards the south. Then taking a directiontowards the west, it would cut through the middle of Asia,were it not that the seas check it in its triumphant careeralong the land. It accordingly strikes off in a northerlydirection, and forming an arc, occupies an immense tract ofcountry, nature, designedly as it were, every now and thenthrowing seas in the way to oppose its career; here the Seaof Phœnicia, there the Sea of Pontus, in this direction theCaspian and Hyrcanian<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>, and then, opposite to them, theLake Mæotis. Although somewhat curtailed by these obstacles,it still winds along between them, and makes its<pb n="1454" />way even amidst these barriers; and victorious after all, itthen escapes with its sinuous course to the kindred chainof the Riphæan mountains. Numerous are the nameswhich it bears, as it is continuously designated by new onesthroughout the whole of its course. In the first part of itscareer it has the name of Imaüs<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>, after which it is knownsuccessively by the names of Emodus, Paropanisus, Circius,Cambades, Paryadres, Choatras, Oreges, Oroandes, Niphates,Taurus, and, where it even out-tops itself, Caucasus. Whereit throws forth its arms as though every now and then itwould attempt to invade the sea, it bears the names of Sarpedon,Coracesius, Cragus, and then again Taurus. Wherealso it opens and makes a passage to admit mankind, it stillclaims the credit of an unbroken continuity by giving thename of "Gates" to these passes, which in one place arecalled the "Gates of Armenia<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>," in another the "Gates of theCaspian," and in another the "Gates of Cilicia." In additionto this, when it has been cut short in its onward career, itretires to a distance from the seas, and covers itself on theone side and the other with the names of numerous nations,being called, on the right-hand side the Hyrcanian and theCaspian, and on the left the Parvadrian<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>, the Moschian, theAmazonian, the Coraxican, and the Scythian chain. Amongthe Greeks it bears the one general name of Ceraunian<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>.<pb n="1455" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It was inclosed by Caria and Pamphylia on the west and east, and on the north by the district of Cibyrates in Phrygia.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Gulf of Satalieh or Adalia.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Still known as Cape Khelidonia or Cameroso.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Parisot remarks here, "Pliny describes on this occasion, with an exactness very remarkable for his time, the chain of mountains which runs through the part of Asia known to the ancients, although it is evident that he confines the extent of them within much too small a compass."</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Caspian and the Hyrcanian Seas are generally looked upon as identical, but we find them again distinguished by Pliny in B. vi. c. 13, where he says that this inland sea commences to be called the <hi rend="ital">Caspian</hi> after you have passed the river Cyrus (or Kúr), and that the Caspii live near it; and in C. 16, that it is called the <hi rend="ital">Hyrcanian</hi> Sea, from the Hyrcani who live along its shores. The western side would therefore in strictness be called the <hi rend="ital">Caspian,</hi> and the eastern the <hi rend="ital">Hyrcanian</hi> Sea.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The name of Imaüs was, in the first instance, applied by the Greek geographers to the Hindú-Kúsh and to the chain parallel to the equator, to which the name of Himâlaya is usually given at the present day. The name was gradually extended to the intersection running north and south, the meridian axis of Central Asia, or the <hi rend="ital">Bolor</hi> range. The divisions of Asia into 'intra et extra Imaum,' were unknown to Strabo and Pliny, though the latter describes the knot of mountains formed by the intersections of the Himalaya, the Hindú-Kúsh, and Bolor, by the expression 'quorum (Montes Emodi) promontorium Imaüs vocatur.' The Bolor chain has been for ages, with one or two exceptions, the boundary between the empires of China and Turkestan."—<hi rend="ital">Dr. Smith's Dictionary of Ancient Geography.</hi></p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Gates of Armenia are spoken of in B. vi. c. 12, the Gates of the Caspian in C. 16 of the same Book, and the Gates of Cilicia in C. 22 of the present Book.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See C. ix. of the next Book.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Strabo gives this name to only the eastern portion of the Caucasian chain which overhangs the Caspian Sea and forms the northern boundary of Albania, and in which he places the Amazons. Mela seems to apply the name to the whole chain which other writers call Caucasus, confining the latter term to a part of it. Pliny (B. v. c. 27 &amp; B. vi. c. 11) gives precisely the same representation, with the additional error of making the Ceraunii (<hi rend="ital">i. e.</hi> the Caucasus of others) part of the Great Taurus Chain. He seems to apply the name of Caucasus to the spurs which spread out both to the north-east and the south-east from the main chain near its eastern extremity, and which he regarded as a continuous range, bordering the western shores of the Caspian. See B. vi. c. 10."—<hi rend="ital">Dr. Smith's Dictionary of Ancient Geography.</hi></p></body>
