<div2 type="chapter" n="3" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 3.—WHAT SOILS ARE TO BE CONSIDERED THE BEST.</head><p>Next after the influences of the heavens, we have to treat ofthose of the earth, a task that is in no way more easy than theprevious one. It is but rarely that the same soil is foundsuited to trees as well as corn: indeed, the black<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> earth whichprevails in Campania is not everywhere found suited to the vine,nor yet that which emits light exhalations, or the red<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> soilthat has been so highly praised by many. The cretaceous earththat is found in the territory of Alba Pompeia, and an argillaceous soil, are preferred to all others for the vine, although,too, they are remarkably rich, a quality that is generally lookedupon as not suited to that plant. On the other hand, again,the white sand of the district of Ticinum, the black sand ofmany other places, and the red sand as well, even though mixedwith a rich earth, will prove unproductive.</p><p>The very signs, also, from which we form our judgment areoften very deceptive; a soil that is adorned with tall andgraceful trees is not always a favourable one, except, of course,for those trees. What tree, in fact, is there that is taller thanthe fir? and yet what other plant could possibly exist in thesame spot? Nor ought we always to look upon verdant pastures as so many proofs of richness of soil; for what is therethat enjoys a greater renown than the pastures of Germany?and yet they consist of nothing but a very thin layer of turf,with sand immediately beneath. Nor yet is the soil whichproduces herbage<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> of large growth always to be looked upon ashumid; no, by Hercules! no more than a soil is to be lookedupon as unctuous and rich, which adheres to the fingers—a<pb n="3447" />thing that is proved in the case of the argillaceous earths.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>The earth when thrown back into the hole from which it hasjust been dug will never<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> fill it, so that it is quite impossibleby that method to form any opinion as to its density or thinness. It is the fact, too, that every<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> soil, without exception,will cover iron with rust. Nor yet can we determine<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> theheaviness or lightness of soils in relation to any fixed and ascertained weight: for what are we to understand as thestandard weight of earth? A soil, too, that is formed fromthe alluvion<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> of rivers is not always to be recommended, forthere are some crops that decay all the sooner in a watery soil;indeed, those soils even of this description which are highlyesteemed, are never found to be long good for any kind ofvegetation but the willow.</p><p>Among other proofs of the goodness of soil, is the comparativethickness of the stem in corn. In Laborium, a famous champaign country of Campania, the stalk is of such remarkablethickness, that it may be used even to supply the place ofwood:<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> and yet this very soil, from the difficulty that is everywhere experienced in cultivating it, and the labour requiredin working it, may be almost said to give the husbandmanmore trouble by its good qualities than it could possibly havedone by reason of any defects. The soil, too, that is generallyknown as charcoal earth, appears susceptible of being improved by being planted with a poor meagre vine: and tufa,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span><pb n="3448" />which is naturally rough and friable, we find recommendedby some authors. Virgil,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> too, does not condemn for the vinea soil which produces fern:<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> while a salted earth<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> is thoughtto be much better entrusted with the growth of vegetation thanany other, from the fact of its being comparatively safe fromnoxious insects breeding there. Declivities, too, are far fromunproductive, if a person only knows how to dig them properly; and it is not all<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> champaign spots that are less accessible to the sun and wind than is necessary for their benefit.We have already<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> alluded to the fact, that there are certainvines which find nutriment in hoar frosts and fogs.</p><p>In every subject there are certain deep and reconditesecrets, which it is left to the intelligence of each to penetrate.Do awe not, for instance, find it the fact, that soils which havelong offered opportunities for a sound judgment being formed ontheir qualities have become totally altered? In the vicinityof Larissa, in Thessaly, a lake was drained;<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> and the consequence was, that the district became much colder, and theolive-trees which had formerly borne fruit now ceased to bear.When a channel was cut for the Hebrus, near the town ofÆnos, the place was sensible of its nearer approach, in findingits vines frost-bitten, a thing that had never happened before;in the vicinity, too, of Philippi, the country having beendrained for cultivation, the nature of the climate became entirely altered. In the territory of Syracuse, a husbandman,who was a stranger to the place, cleared the soil of all thestones, and the consequence was, that he lost his crops frontthe accumulation of mud; so that at last he was obliged tocarry the stones back again. In Syria again, the plough-<pb n="3449" />share which they use is narrow, and the furrows are but verysuperficial, there being a rock beneath the soil that in summerscorches up the seeds.</p><p>Then, too, the effects of excessive cold and heat in variousplaces are similar; thus, for instance, Thrace is fruitful incorn, by reason of the cold, while Africa and Egypt are so inconsequence of the heat that prevails there. At Chalcia,<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> anisland belonging to the Rhodians, there is a certain place whichis so remarkably fertile, that after reaping the barley that hasbeen sown at the ordinary time, and gathering it in, they immediately sow a fresh crop, and reap it at the same time as theother corn. A gravelly soil is found best suited for the olivein the district of Venafrum,<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> while one of extreme richness isrequired for it in Bætica. The wines of Pucinum<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> are ripened upon a rock, and the vines of Cæcubum<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> are moistenedby the waters of the Pomptine<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> marshes; so great are the differences that have been detected by human experience in thevarious soils. Cæsar Vopiscus, when pleading a cause beforethe Censors, said that the fields of Rosia<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> are the very marrow<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span>of Italy, and that a stake, left in the ground there one day,would be found covered by the grass the next:<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span> the soil, however, is only esteemed there for the purposes of pasturage. Still,however, Nature has willed that we should not remain uninstructed, and has made full admission as to existing defects insoil, even in cases where she has failed to give us equal information as to its good qualities: we shall begin, therefore,by speaking of the defects that are found in various soils.</p><p>(5.) If it is the wish of a person to test whether a soil isbitter, or whether it is thin and meagre, the fact may be easilyascertained from the presence of black and undergrown herbs.If, again, the herbage shoots up dry and stunted, it shows thatthe soil is cold, and if sad and languid, that it is moist andslimy. The eye, too, is able to judge whether it is a red earthor whether it is argillaceous, both of them extremely difficultto work, and apt to load the harrow or ploughshare with<pb n="3450" />enormous clods; though at the same time it should be bornein mind that the soil which entails the greatest amount oflabour is not always productive of the smallest amount ofprofit. So, too, on the other hand, the eye can distinguish asoil that is mixed with ashes or with white sand, while earththat is sterile and dense may be easily detected by its peculiarhardness, at even a single stroke of the mattock.</p><p>Cato,<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span> briefly and in his peculiar manner, characterizes thedefects that exist in the various soils. "Take care," he says,"where the earth is rotten not to shake it either with carts orby driving cattle over it." Now what are we to suppose thatthis term "rotten" means, as applied to a soil, about whichhe is so vastly apprehensive as to almost forbid our settingfoot upon it? Let us only form a comparison 'by thinkingwhat it is that constitutes rottenness in wood, and we shallfind that the faults which are held by him in such aversion arethe being arid, full of holes, rough, white, mouldy, wormeaten, in fact, just like pumice-stone; and thus has Cato saidmore in a single word than we could have possibly foundmeans to express in a description, however long. Indeed, ifwe could find means of expressing the various defects thatexist in soils, we should find that there are some of them thatare old, not with age (for age cannot<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span> be concerned in relationto the earth), but of their own nature, and are hence unfruitful and powerless for every purpose from the first. The samewriter,<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span> too, considers that as the very best of soils, which,situate at the foot of a declivity, runs out into a champaigncountry, taking a southward direction; such, in fact, beingthe aspect of the whole of Italy:<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span> he says<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span> also, that the earthgenerally known as black<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span> earth is of a tender nature, andis consequently the most easily worked and the best for cereals.If we only appreciate with due care the signification of thisword "tender,"<span id="ref_31"><a href="#note_31">[31]</a></span> we shall find that it expresses its intendedmeaning remarkably well, and that in this word is comprisedevery quality that is desirable for the purposes of cultivation.<pb n="3451" />In a tender soil we shall find fertility combined with moderation, a softness and a pliancy easily adapted to cultivation,and an equal absence of humidity and of dryness. Earthof this nature will shine again after the plough-share haspassed through it, just as Homer,<span id="ref_32"><a href="#note_32">[32]</a></span> that great fountain-head ofall genius, has described it sculptured by the Divinity<span id="ref_33"><a href="#note_33">[33]</a></span> uponthe arms [of Achilles], adding, too, a thing that is truly marvellous, that it was of a blackish hue, though gold was the material in which it was wrought. This, too, is that kind of earth,which, when newly turned up, attracts the ravenous birds thatfollow the plough-share, the ravens even going so far as to peckat the heels of the ploughman.</p><p>We may in this place appropriately make mention of anopinion that has been pronounced by an Italian writer alsowith reference to a matter of luxury. Cicero,<span id="ref_34"><a href="#note_34">[34]</a></span> that otherluminary of literature, has made the following remark: "Thoseunguents which have a taste of earth<span id="ref_35"><a href="#note_35">[35]</a></span> are better," says he,"than those which smack of saffron;" it seeming to himmore to the purpose to express himself by the word " taste"<span id="ref_36"><a href="#note_36">[36]</a></span>than "smell." And such is the fact, no doubt; that soilis the best which has the flavour of a perfume.<span id="ref_37"><a href="#note_37">[37]</a></span> If thequestion should be put to us, what is this odour of the earththat is held in such estimation, our answer is, that it is thesame that is often to be recognized at the moment of sunset,without the necessity even of turning up the ground, at thespots where the extremities of the rainbow<span id="ref_38"><a href="#note_38">[38]</a></span> have been observed to meet the earth; as also when, after long-continueddrought, the rain has soaked the ground. Then it is that theearth exhales this divine odour, that is so peculiarly its own,and to which, imparted to it by the sun, there is no perfume,however sweet, that can possibly be compared. It is thisodour that the earth, when turned up, ought to emit, andwhich, when once found, can never deceive a person; andthis will be found the best criterion for judging of the qualityof the soil. Such, too, is the odour that is usually perceived<pb n="3452" />on land newly cleared,<span id="ref_39"><a href="#note_39">[39]</a></span> when an ancient forest has been justcut down; its excellence is a thing that is universally admitted.</p><p>For the culture of the cereals, too, the same land is generally looked upon as the more improved the oftener it hasbeen allowed to rest<span id="ref_40"><a href="#note_40">[40]</a></span> from cultivation, a thing that is not thecase with vineyards; for which reason all the greater care isrequired in the selection of their site, if we would not havethe opinions of those to appear well founded who entertain thenotion that the soil of Italy is already worn out.<span id="ref_41"><a href="#note_41">[41]</a></span> In otherkinds of soil the work of cultivation depends entirely upon theweather; as, for instance, in those which cannot be ploughedjust after rain, because the natural exuberance of the earthrenders it viscous and cloggy. On the other hand, in Byza-cium, a district of Africa, and a champaign country of suchsingular fertility as to render grain one hundred and fifty fold,<span id="ref_42"><a href="#note_42">[42]</a></span>the soil is such, that in time of drought, not even bulls areable to plough it; while, on another occasion, just after a showerof rain, one poor ass, with an old woman to guide it, is quitesufficient,<span id="ref_43"><a href="#note_43">[43]</a></span> as ourselves we have witnessed, to do the plough-ing. But as to amending one soil by the agency of another,as some persons recommend, by throwing rich earth over onethat is poor and thin, or by laying a soaking light soil overone that is humid and unctuous, it is a labour of perfectmadness.<span id="ref_44"><a href="#note_44">[44]</a></span> What can a man possibly hope for who cultivatessuch a soil as this?</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A rich black mould, probably.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A ferruginous argilla.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It must of necessity denote a soil rich in humus, though not, ofcourse, adapted for all kinds of cultivation.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He alludes to the difficulty with which argilla, from its tenacity, isemployed in cultivation.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Columella says the contrary, and so does Virgil, Georg. ii. 226,speaking of this fact as a method of ascertaining the respective qualities ofthe earth.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Virgil, Georg. ii. 220, says the contrary.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In allusion to what Virgil says, Georg. ii. 254:—"Quæ gravis est, ipso tacitam se pondere prodit,<lb />Quæque levis——"<lb />Fée remarks, however, that it is easy enough to analyse the earth, andascertain the proportions of humus, and of the siliceous, cretaceous, orargillaceous earths; the relative proportions of which render it strong orlight, as the case may be.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">As Fée says, these earths vary according to the nature of the soilsthat are brought down by the streams; in general, however, they are extremely prolific.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Fée says that Pliny is here guilty of some degree of exaggeration.See B. iii. c. 9, p. 195 of Vol. 1: also B. xviii. c. 29.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Tophus;" formed of volcanic scoriæ.
