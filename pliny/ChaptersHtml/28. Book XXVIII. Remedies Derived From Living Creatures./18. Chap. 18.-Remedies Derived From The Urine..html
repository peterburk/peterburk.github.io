<div2 type="chapter" n="18" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 18.—REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE URINE.</head><p>The urine,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> too, has been the subject not only of numerous<pb n="5300" />theories with authors, but of various religious observances aswell, its properties being classified under several distinctiveheads: thus, for instance, the urine of eunuchs, they say, ishighly beneficial as a promoter of fruitfulness in females. Butto turn to those remedies which we may be allowed to namewithout impropriety—the urine of children who have notarrived at puberty is a sovereign remedy for the poisonoussecretions of the asp known as the "ptyas,"<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> from the factthat it spits its venom into the eyes of human beings. It isgood, too, for the cure of albugo, films and marks upon theeyes, white specks<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> upon the pupils, and maladies of the eyelids. In combination with meal of fitches, it is used for thecure of burns, and, with a head of bulbed leek, it is boileddown to one half, in a new earthen vessel, for the treatment ofsuppurations of the ears, or the extermination of worms breeding in those organs: the vapour, too, of this decoction acts asan emmenagogue. Salpe recommends that the eyes shouldbe fomented with it, as a means of strengthening the sight;and that it should be used as a liniment for sun scorches,in combination with white of egg, that of the ostrich beingthe most effectual, the application being kept on for a coupleof hours.</p><p>Urine is also used for taking out ink spots. Male urinecures gout, witness the fullers for instance,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> who, for thisreason, it is said, are never troubled with that disease. Withstale urine some mix ashes of calcined oyster-shells, for thecure of eruptions on the bodies of infants, and all kinds ofrunning ulcers: it is used, too, as a liniment for corrosive sores,burns, diseases of the rectum, chaps upon the body, and stingsinflicted by scorpions. The most celebrated midwives havepronounced that there is no lotion which removes itching sensations more effectually; and, with the addition of nitre,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> theyprescribe it for the cure of ulcers of the head, porrigo, andcancerous sores, those of the generative organs in particular.But the fact is, and there is no impropriety in saying so, thatevery person's own urine is the best for his own case, due<pb n="5301" />care being taken to apply it immediately, and unmixed withanything else; in such cases as the bite of a dog, for instance,or the quill of a hedge-hog entering the flesh, a sponge orsome wool being the vehicle in which it is applied. Kneadedup with ashes, it is good for the bite of a mad dog, and for thecure of stings inflicted by serpents. As to the bite of thescolopendra, the effects of urine are said to be quite marvellous—the person who has been injured has only to touchthe crown of his head with a drop of his own urine, and hewill experience an instantaneous cure.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This excretion was, till lately, thought of great importance, as indicative of the health of the patient.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From the Greek <foreign lang="greek">ptuw\,</foreign> "to spit."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Argema."</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Who had to use <hi rend="ital">lant,</hi> or stale urine, in their business.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">At a future period we shall have to discuss the identity of the"nitrum" of Pliny.
