Hence the shadow of the dial-pin,which is termed the gnomon, at noon and at the summersolstice, in Egypt, is a little more than half the length of thegnomon itself At the city of Rome it is only 1/9 less thanthe gnomon, at Ancona not more than 1/35 less, while inthe part of Italy which is called Venetia, at the same hour,the shadow is equal to the length of the gnomon<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>.<pb n="1107" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Vasa horoscopica." "Vasa horoscopica appellat horologia in planodescripta, horizonti ad libellam respondentia.
