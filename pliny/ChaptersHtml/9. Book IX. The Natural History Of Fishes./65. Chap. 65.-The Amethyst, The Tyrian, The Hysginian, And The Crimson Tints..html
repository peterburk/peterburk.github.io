<div2 type="chapter" n="65" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 65.—THE AMETHYST, THE TYRIAN, THE HYSGINIAN, AND THE CRIMSON TINTS.</head><p>But no sooner have we finished with one branch of thissubject than we have to begin upon another, for we find thatit is made quite a matter of sport to create expense; and notonly this, but the sport must be doubled by making new mixtures and combinations, and falsifying over again what wasa falsification of the works of Nature already; such, for instance, as staining tortoise-shell,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> alloying gold with silver forthe purpose of making electrum,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and then adding copper tothe mixture to make Corinthian metal.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span></p><p>(41.) It was not sufficient to have borrowed from a preciousstone the name of "amethyst" for a dye, but when we have obtained this colour we must drench it over again with Tyriantints,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> so that we may have an upstart name<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> compounded ofboth, and at the same moment a two-fold display of luxury;for as soon as ever people have succeeded in obtaining theconchyliated colour, they immediately begin to think that itwill do better as a state of transition to the Tyrian hues.There can be little doubt that this invention is due to someartist who happened to change his mind, and alter a tintwith which he was not pleased: hence a system has taken itsrise, and spirits, ever on the rack for creating wonders, havetransformed what was originally a blunder into somethingquite desirable; while, at the same time, a double path has<pb n="2450" />been pointed out to luxury, in thus making one colour carryanother, and thereby become, as they say, softer and moremellow. And what is even more than this, human ingenuityhas even learned to mingle with these dyes the productions ofthe earth, and to steep in Tyrian purple fabrics already dyedcrimson with the berry of the kermes, in order to produce thehysginian<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> tint. The kermes of Galatia, a red berry whichwe shall mention when we come to speak<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> of the productionsof the earth, is the most esteemed of all, except, perhaps, theone that grows in the vicinity of Emerita,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> in Lusitania.However, to make an end, once for all, of my description ofthese precious dyes, I shall remark, that the colour yielded bythis grain<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> when a year old, is of a pallid hue, and that if it ismore than four years old, it is quickly discharged: hence wefind that its energies are not developed either when it is tooyoung or when old.</p><p>I have now abundantly treated of an art, by means of whichmen, just as much as women, have an idea that their appearancemay be set off to the greatest possible advantage.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is mentioned more fully in B. xvi. c. 84.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxxiii. c. 23.

They are used as a red andscarlet dye, but are very inferior to cochineal, which has almost entirelysuperseded the use of the kermes. The colour is of a deep red, and willstand better than that of cochineal, and is less liable to stain.</p></body>
