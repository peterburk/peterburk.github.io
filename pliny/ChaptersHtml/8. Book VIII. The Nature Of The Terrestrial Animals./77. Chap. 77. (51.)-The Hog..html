<div2 type="chapter" n="77" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 77. (51.)—THE HOG. <span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span></head><p>The period for coupling the hog lasts from the return of thewest wind to the vernal equinox; the proper age commencesin the eighth month, indeed, in some places, in the fourtheven, and continues until the eighth year<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> They bring forthtwice in the year, the time of gestation being four months;the number at a birth amounts to twenty even, but they cannot rear so large a number.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> Nigidius informs us, that thosewhich are produced within ten days of the winter solstice areborn with teeth. One coupling is sufficient, but it is repeated,on account of their extreme liability to abortion; the remedyfor which is not to allow coupling the first time the female isin heat, nor until its ears are flaccid and pendant. The malesdo not generate after they are three years old. When thefemales become feeble from old age, they receive the maleslying down.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> It is not looked upon as anything portentouswhen they eat their young. The young of the hog is considered in a state of purity for sacrifice when five days old,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> thelamb on the seventh day, and the calf on the thirtieth. Coruncanius asserts, that ruminant animals are not proper for<pb n="2343" />victims until they have two teeth.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> It has been supposed,that when a pig has lost one eye, it will not live long;<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> otherwise, these animals generally live up to fifteen, or sometimestwenty years. They sometimes become mad; besides which, theyare liable to other diseases, especially to quinsy<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> and to scrofula.<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> It is an indication that the hog is diseased, when bloodis found at the root of a bristle pulled from its back, and when itholds its head on one side while walking. When the femalebecomes too fat, she has a deficiency of milk; the first litter isalways the least numerous. Animals of this kind delight inrolling in the mud.<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> The tail is curled, and it has also beenremarked, that those are a more acceptable offering to the gods,whose tail is turned to the right than those which have itturned to the left. They may be fattened in sixty days, andmore especially if they have been kept without food for threedays before fattening. The swine is by far the most brutishof all the animals, and it has been said, and not unaptly, thatlife has been given them in place of salt.<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> And yet it has beenknown, that these animals, when carried away by thieves,have recognized the voice of their keeper; and when a vesselhas been under water through the inclination of one of itssides, they have had the sense to go over to the other side.The leader of the herd will even learn to go to market, and to<pb n="2344" />different houses in the city. In the wild state also, they havethe sense to pass their urine in plashy places, that they maydestroy all traces of them, and so lighten themselves forflight.<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> The female is spayed, just as is done with the camel;after they have fasted two days, they are suspended by thehind feet, and the orifice of the womb is cut; after this operation, they fatten more quickly.<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span></p><p>M. Apicius<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> made the discovery, that we may employ thesame artificial method of increasing the size of the liver of thesow, as of that of the goose;<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> it consists in cramming themwith dried figs, and when they are fat enough, they are drenchedwith wine mixed with honey, and immediately killed. Thereis no animal that affords a greater variety to the palate of theepicure; all the others have their own peculiar flavour, but theflesh of the hog has nearly fifty different flavours. Hence itis, that there are whole pages of regulations made by the cen-sors, forbidding the serving up at banquets of the belly, thekernels,<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> the testicles, the womb, and the cheeks. However,notwithstanding all this, the poet Publius,<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> the author of theMimes, when he ceased to be a slave, is said to have givenno entertainment without serving up the belly of a sow, towhich he also gave the name of "sumen."</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We have an account of the hog in Varro, B. ii. c. 4, from whom mostof Pliny's remarks are probably derived.—B.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Varro, B. ii. c. 4, and Columella, B. vii. c. 9. fix upon the seventhyear.—B.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Varro, and Columella, <hi rend="ital">ubi supra,</hi> recommend that the sow should nothe allowed to rear more than eight young ones at each birth.—B.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle, Hist.
