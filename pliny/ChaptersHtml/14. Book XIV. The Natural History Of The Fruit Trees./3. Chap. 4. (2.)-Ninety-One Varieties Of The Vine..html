<div2 type="chapter" n="4" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 4. (2.)—NINETY-ONE VARIETIES OF THE VINE.</head><p>Democritus, who has declared that he was acquainted withevery variety of the grape known in Greece, is the only personwho has been of opinion that every kind could be enumerated;but, on the other hand, the rest of the authors have stated thatthey are quite innumerable<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and of infinite extent, an assertionthe truth of which will be more evident, if we only considerthe vast number of wines. I shall not attempt, then, to speakof every kind of vine, but only of those that are the most remarkable, seeing that the varieties are very nearly as numberless as the districts in which they grow. It will suffice, then,to point out those which are the most remarkable among thevines, or else are peculiar for some wonderful property.</p><p>The very highest rank is given to the Aminean<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> grape, on<pb n="3223" />account of the body and durability of its wine, which improveswith old age. There are five varieties of the Aminean grape;of these, the smaller germana, or "sister" grape, has a smallerberry than the rest, and flowers more strongly, being able totear up against rain and tempestuous weather; a thing thatis not the case with the larger germana, though it is less exposed to danger when attached to a tree than when supportedonly by a trellis. Another kind, again, has obtained thename of the "gemella," or "twin" grape, because the clustersalways grow<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> in couples: the flavour of the wine is extremelyrough, but it is remarkable for its strength. Of these severalvarieties the smaller one suffers from the south wind, but receives nutriment from all the others, upon Mount Vesuvius,for instance, and the hills of Surrentum: in the other parts ofItaly it is never grown except attached to trees. The fifthkind is that known as the lanata, or "woolly" grape; so thatwe need not be surprised at the wool-bearing trees<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> of theSeres or the Indians, for this grape is covered with a woollydown of remarkable thickness. It is the first of the Aminean vines that ripens, but the grape decays with remarkablerapidity.</p><p>The second rank belongs to the vines of Nomentum,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> thewood of which is red, from which circumstance the vines havereceived from some the name of "rubellæ." The grapes ofthis vine produce less wine than usual, in consequence of theextraordinary quantity of husk and lees they throw off: butthe vine is remarkably strong, is well able to stand the frost,and is apt to receive more detriment from drought than fromrain, from heat than from cold; hence it is that those arelooked upon as the best that are grown in cold and moistlocalities. That variety which has the smallest grape is con-<pb n="3224" />sidered the most fruitful: the one which has a jagged leaf isless productive.</p><p>The vine known as the "apiana,"<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> has received that namefrom the bee, an insect which is remarkably fond of it: thereare two varieties of this vine. This grape, too, is covered inits young state with a kind of down; the main difference between the two varieties is, that the one ripens more rapidlythan the other, though this last ripens with considerablequickness. A cold locality is not at all hurtful to them,although there is no grape that ripens sooner: these grapes,however, very soon rot in the rain. The wines produced bythis grape are sweet at first, but contract a rough flavour inthe course of years. This vine is cultivated more than anyother in Etruria. Thus far we have made mention of themore celebrated vines among those which are peculiar and indigenous to Italy; the rest have been introduced from Chiosor Thasos.</p><p>The small Greek<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> grape is not inferior to the Aminean forthe excellence of its quality: the berry is remarkably thin-skinned, and the cluster so extremely small,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> that it is notworth while cultivating it, except on a soil of remarkablerichness. The eugenia,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> so called from its high qualities, hasbeen introduced into the Alban territory from the hills ofTauromenium:<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> it is found, however, to thrive only there,for if transplanted elsewhere it degenerates immediately: infact, there is in some vines so strong an attachment to theirnative soil, that they leave behind them all their high repute,and are never transplanted in their full entirety. This is thecase, too, with the Rhætian and the Allobrogian grapes, ofwhich we have made mention above as the pitch-flavoured<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>grape; these are justly deemed excellent in their own coun-<pb n="3225" />try, while elsewhere they are held in no esteem at all. Still,however, in consequence of their remarkable fertility, theymake up for quality by abundance: the eugenia thrives inspots which are scorching hot, the Rhætian vine in places of amore moderate temperature, and the Allobrogian in cold, exposed situations, the fruit being of a black colour, and ripenedby the agency of frost.</p><p>The wines produced from the vines of which we havehitherto made mention, even though the grapes are black,become, all of them, when old, of a white<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> complexion. Theother vines are of no note in particular, though sometimes,thanks to some peculiarity either in the climate or the soil,the wines produced from them attain a mature old age; such,for instance, as the Fecenian<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> vine, and the Biturigian,<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> whichblossoms at the same time with it, but has not so many grapes.The blossoms of these last-mentioned vines are not liable toreceive injury, both because they are naturally but transitory, and have the power of resisting the action of both windand storm; still, however, those that grow in cold spots areconsidered superior to those produced in a warm site, and thosefound in moist places superior to those grown in dry, thirstylocalities.</p><p>The vine known as the "visula"<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> * * * * morethan abundance of fruit, being unable to endure the extremevariations of the atmosphere, though it is very well able tostand a continuation of either cold or heat. Of this last kindthe smaller one is the best, but difficult to please in its choice;in a rich earth it is apt to rot, while in a thin soil it will cometo nothing at all: in its fastidiousness it requires a soil ofmiddling quality, and hence it is that it is so commonly foundon the hills of the Sabine territory. Its grape is unsightly inappearance, but has a very pleasant flavour: if it is not gatheredat the very moment that it is ripe, it will fall, even before itdecays. The extreme size of the leaves, and its natural hardi-<pb n="3226" />ness, are its great protection against the disastrous effects ofhail.</p><p>The grapes known as "helvolæ"<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> are remarkable for thepeculiarity of their colour, which is a sort of midway betweenpurple and black, but varies so frequently that it has madesome persons give them the name of "varianæ." Of the twosorts of helvolæ, the black is the one generally preferred: theyboth of them produce every other year, but the wine is bestwhen the vintage has been less abundant.</p><p>The vine that is known as the "precia"<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> is also dividedinto two varieties, distinguished by the size of the grape.These vines produce a vast quantity of wood, and the grape isvery good for preserving in jars;<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> the leaves are similar inappearance to that of parsley.<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> The people of Dyrrhachiumhold in high esteem the vine known as the "basilica," thesame which in Spain is called the "cocolobis."<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> The grapesof this vine grow in thin clusters, and it can stand great heat,and the south winds. The wine produced from it is apt to flyto the head:<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> the produce of the vine is very large. Thepeople in Spain distinguish two kinds of this vine, the onewith the oblong, the other with the round grape; they gatherthis fruit the very last of all. The sweeter the cocolobis is,the more it is valued; but even if it has a rough taste, the winewill become sweet by keeping, while, on the other hand, thatwhich was sweet at first, will acquire a certain roughness; itis in this last state that the wine is thought to rival that ofAlba.<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> It is said that the juice of this grape is remarkablyefficacious when drunk as a specific for diseases of the bladder.<pb n="3227" /></p><p>The "albuelis"<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span> produces most of its fruit at the top ofthe tree, the visula at the bottom; hence, when planted aroundthe same tree, in consequence of these peculiarities in theirnature, they bear between them a two-fold crop. One of theblack grape vines has been called the "inerticula,"<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span> thoughit might with more propriety have been styled the "sobria;"<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span>the wine from it is remarkably good, and more particularlywhen old; but though strong, it is productive of no ill effects,and, indeed, is the only wine that will not cause intoxication.</p><p>The abundance of their produce again recommends othervines to us, and, in the first place, that known as the "helvennaca."<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span> Of this vine there are two kinds; the larger, whichis by some called the "long" helvennaca, and the smallerkind, which is known as the "emarcum,"<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span> not so prolific asthe first, but producing a wine of more agreeable flavour; itis distinguished by its rounded leaf, but they are both ofthem of slender make. It is requisite to place forks beneaththese vines for the support of their branches, as otherwise itwould be quite impossible for them to support the weight oftheir produce: they receive nutriment from the breezes thatblow from the sea, and foggy weather is injurious to them.There is not one among the vines that manifests a greateraversion to Italy, for there it becomes comparatively leaflessand stunted, and soon decays, while the wine which it producesthere will not keep beyond the summer: no vine, however,thrives better in a poor soil. Græcinus, who has copied fromthe works of Cornelius Celsus, gives it as his opinion that it isnot that the nature of this vine is repugnant to the climateof Italy, but that it is the mode of cultivating it that is<pb n="3228" />wrong, and the anxiety to force it to put forth its shoots; amode of treatment, he thinks, which absorbs all its fertility,unless the soil in which it is planted happens to be remarkablyrich, and by its support prevents it from being exhausted. Itis said that this vine is never carbuncled,<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span> a remarkable quality, if, indeed, it really is the fact that there is any vine inexistence that is exempt from the natural influences of theclimate.</p><p>The spionia, by some called the "spinea,"<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span> is able to bearheat very well, and thrives in the autumn and rainy weather:indeed, it is the only one among all the vines that does wellamid fogs, for which reason it is peculiar to the territory ofRavenna.<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span> The venicula<span id="ref_31"><a href="#note_31">[31]</a></span> is one of those that blossom thestrongest, and its grapes are particularly well adapted for preserving in jars. The Campanians, however, prefer to give itthe name of "scircula," while others, again, call it "stacula."Tarracina has a vine known as the "numisiana;" it has noqualities of its own, but has characteristics just according tothe nature of the soil in which it is planted: the wine, however, if kept in the earthen casks<span id="ref_32"><a href="#note_32">[32]</a></span> of Surrentum, is remarkable for its goodness, that is to say, as far south as Vesuvius.On arriving in that district, we find the Murgentina,<span id="ref_33"><a href="#note_33">[33]</a></span> the verybest among all those that come from Sicily. Some, indeed,call the vine "Pompeiana,"<span id="ref_34"><a href="#note_34">[34]</a></span> and it is more particularly fruitfulwhen grown in Latium, just as the "horconia"<span id="ref_35"><a href="#note_35">[35]</a></span> is productivenowhere but in Campania. Of a contrary nature is the vineknown as the "argeica," and by Virgil called "argitis:"<span id="ref_36"><a href="#note_36">[36]</a></span>it makes the ground all the more<span id="ref_37"><a href="#note_37">[37]</a></span> productive, and is remark-<pb n="3229" />ably stout in its resistance to rain and the effects of old age,though it will hardly produce wine every year; it is remarkable for the abundant crops which it bears, though the grapesare held but in small esteem for eating. The vine known asthe "metica" lasts well for years, and offers a successful resistance to all changes of weather; the grape is black, and thewine assumes a tawny hue when old.</p><p>(3.) The varieties that have been mentioned thus far arethose that are generally known; the others belong to peculiarcountries or individual localities, or else are of a mixed nature,the produce of grafting. Thus the vine known as the "Tudernis,"<span id="ref_38"><a href="#note_38">[38]</a></span> is peculiar to the districts of Etruria, and so too is thevine that bears the name of "Florentia." At Arretium thetalpona, the etesiaca, and the consemina, are particularly excellent.<span id="ref_39"><a href="#note_39">[39]</a></span> The talpona,<span id="ref_40"><a href="#note_40">[40]</a></span> which is a black grape, produces apale, straw-coloured<span id="ref_41"><a href="#note_41">[41]</a></span> must: the etesiaca<span id="ref_42"><a href="#note_42">[42]</a></span> is apt to deceive;the more the wine it produces the better the quality, but itis a remarkable fact, that just as it has reached that point itsfecundity ceases altogether. The consemina<span id="ref_43"><a href="#note_43">[43]</a></span> bears a blackgrape, but its wine will not keep, though the grape itself isa most excellent keeper; it is gathered fifteen days later thanany other kind of grape: this vine is very fruitful, but itsgrape is only good for eating. The leaves of this tree, likethose of the wild vine, turn the colour of blood just before thefall: the same is the case also with some<span id="ref_44"><a href="#note_44">[44]</a></span> other varieties, butit is a proof that they are of very inferior quality.</p><p>The irtiola<span id="ref_45"><a href="#note_45">[45]</a></span> is a vine peculiar to Umbria and the terri-<pb n="3230" />tories of Mevania and Picenum, while the pumula<span id="ref_46"><a href="#note_46">[46]</a></span> belongsto Amiternum. In the same districts we find the vine calledbannannica,<span id="ref_47"><a href="#note_47">[47]</a></span> which is very deceptive, though the people areremarkably fond of its fruit. The municipal town of Pompeii has given its name to the Pompeia,<span id="ref_48"><a href="#note_48">[48]</a></span> although it is to befound in greater abundance in the territory of Clusium. TheTiburina, also, is so called from the municipal town of Tibûr,although it is in this district that they have lately discoveredthe grape known as the "oleaginea," from its strong resemblance to an olive: this being the very last kind of grape thathas been introduced. The Sabines and the Laurentes are theonly people acquainted with the vinaciola.<span id="ref_49"><a href="#note_49">[49]</a></span> As to the vinesof Mount Gaurus,<span id="ref_50"><a href="#note_50">[50]</a></span> I am aware that, as they have been transplanted from the Falernian territory, they bear the name of"Falernian:" but it is a fact that the Falernian vine, whentransplanted, rapidly degenerates. Some persons, too, havemade out a Tarentine variety, with a grape of remarkablesweetness: the grapes of the "capnios,"<span id="ref_51"><a href="#note_51">[51]</a></span> the "bucconiatis,"<span id="ref_52"><a href="#note_52">[52]</a></span>and the "tarrupia," grow on the hills of Thurii, and arenever gathered till after the frost commences. Pisæ enjoysthe Parian vine, and Mutina the prusinian,<span id="ref_53"><a href="#note_53">[53]</a></span> with a blackgrape, the wine of which turns pale within four years. It isa very remarkable thing, but there is a grape here that turnsround with the sun, in its diurnal motion, a circumstance fromwhich it has received the name of "streptos."<span id="ref_54"><a href="#note_54">[54]</a></span> In Italy, the<span id="ref_55"><a href="#note_55">[55]</a></span><pb n="3231" />Gallic vine is a great favourite, while beyond the Alps that ofPicenum<span id="ref_56"><a href="#note_56">[56]</a></span> is preferred. Virgil has made mention<span id="ref_57"><a href="#note_57">[57]</a></span> of theThasian vine, the Mareotis, the lagea, and several other foreignvarieties, which are not to be found in Italy.</p><p>There are some vines, again, that are remarkable, not fortheir wine, but for their grapes, such, for instance, as the ambrosia,<span id="ref_58"><a href="#note_58">[58]</a></span> one of the "duracinus"<span id="ref_59"><a href="#note_59">[59]</a></span> kind, a grape which requiresno potting, but will keep perfectly well if left on the vine, soremarkable is the strength with which it is endowed for withstanding the effects of cold, heat, and stormy weather. The"orthampelos,"<span id="ref_60"><a href="#note_60">[60]</a></span> too, is a vine that requires neither tree norstay, as it is well able to sustain its own weight. This, however, is not the case with the "dactylis,"<span id="ref_61"><a href="#note_61">[61]</a></span> the stem of whichis no thicker than the finger. The "columbina"<span id="ref_62"><a href="#note_62">[62]</a></span> is one ofthose with the finest clusters, and still more so is the purple"bimammia;" it does not bear in clusters,<span id="ref_63"><a href="#note_63">[63]</a></span> but only secondarybunches. There is the tripedanea,<span id="ref_64"><a href="#note_64">[64]</a></span> too, a name which it owesto the length of its clusters, and the scirpula,<span id="ref_65"><a href="#note_65">[65]</a></span> with its shrivelledberry; the Rhætica,<span id="ref_66"><a href="#note_66">[66]</a></span> too, so called in the Maritime Alps, thoughvery different from the grape of that name which is so highlyesteemed, and of which we have previously spoken; for inthis variety the clusters are small, the grapes lie closely packed,<pb n="3232" />and it produces but a poor wine. It has, however, the thinnest skin of all the grapes, and a single stone,<span id="ref_67"><a href="#note_67">[67]</a></span> of very diminutive size, which is known as the "Chian;"<span id="ref_68"><a href="#note_68">[68]</a></span> one or two ofthe grapes on the cluster are remarkably large. There is alsothe black Aminean, to which the name of Syriaca is given:the Spanish vine, too, the very best of all those of inferiorquality.</p><p>The grapes that are known as escariæ,<span id="ref_69"><a href="#note_69">[69]</a></span> are grown on trellises. Of the duracinus<span id="ref_70"><a href="#note_70">[70]</a></span> kind, there are those known as thewhite and the black varieties; the bumastus, too, is similarlydistinguished in colour. Among the vines too, that havenot as yet been mentioned, there are the Ægian and theRhodian<span id="ref_71"><a href="#note_71">[71]</a></span> kinds, as also the uncialis, so called, it would seem,from its grape being an ounce in weight. There is the picina<span id="ref_72"><a href="#note_72">[72]</a></span>too, the blackest<span id="ref_73"><a href="#note_73">[73]</a></span> grape known, and the stephanitis,<span id="ref_74"><a href="#note_74">[74]</a></span> theclusters of which Nature, in a sportive mood, has arranged inthe form of a garland, the leaves being interspersed<span id="ref_75"><a href="#note_75">[75]</a></span> amongthe grapes; there are the grapes, too, known as the "forenses,"<span id="ref_76"><a href="#note_76">[76]</a></span>and which quickly come to maturity, recommend themselvesto the buyer by their good looks, and are easily carried fromplace to place.</p><p>On the other hand, those known as the "cinerea"<span id="ref_77"><a href="#note_77">[77]</a></span> arecondemned by their very looks, and so are the rabuscula<span id="ref_78"><a href="#note_78">[78]</a></span> andthe asinusca;<span id="ref_79"><a href="#note_79">[79]</a></span> the produce of the alopecis,<span id="ref_80"><a href="#note_80">[80]</a></span> which resemblesin colour a fox's tail, is held in less disesteem. The Alexandrina<span id="ref_81"><a href="#note_81">[81]</a></span> is the name of a vine that grows in the vicinity of Pha-<pb n="3233" />lacra: it is of stunted growth, and has branches a cubit inlength; the grape is black, about the size of a bean, with aberry that is soft, and remarkably small: the clusters hang ina slanting direction, and are remarkably sweet; the leaves aresmall and round, without any division.<span id="ref_82"><a href="#note_82">[82]</a></span> Within the lastseven years there has been introduced at Alba Helvia,<span id="ref_83"><a href="#note_83">[83]</a></span> in theprovince of Gallia Narbonensis, a vine which blossoms but asingle day, and is consequently proof against all accidents:the name given to it is "Narbonica," and it is now plantedthroughout the whole of that province.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Many years ago, there were in the gardens of the Luxembourg onethousand four hundred varieties of the French grape, and even then therewere many not to be found there; while, at the same time, it was considered that the French kinds did not form more than one-twentieth partof the species known in Europe.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This vine was said to be of Grecian origin, and to have been con-veyed by a Thessalian tribe to Italy, where it was grown at Aminea, avillage in the Falernian district of Campania.
