When once it has thusexpelled these superfluities, there is nothing to do but to separateit from the gold; to effect which, it is poured out uponskins that have been well tawed, and so, exuding through themlike a sort of perspiration, it leaves the gold in a state ofpurity behind.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span><pb n="6114" /></p><p>Hence it is, too, that when copper has to be gilded,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> a coat ofquicksilver is laid beneath the gold leaf, which it retains in itsplace with the greatest tenacity: in cases, however, where theleaf is single, or very thin, the presence of the quicksilver isdetected by the paleness of the colour.<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> For this reason, persons,when meditating a piece of fraud, have been in the habitof substituting glair of egg for quicksilver, and then layingupon it a coat of hydrargyros, a substance of which we shallmake further mention in the appropriate place.<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> Generallyspeaking, quicksilver has not been found in any large quantities.<pb n="6115" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Vomica liquoris æterni."

Beckmann has the following remarks on the present passage;"That gold-leaf was affixed to metals by means of quicksilver, with the assistanceof heat, in the time of Pliny, we are told by himself in more passagesthan one. The metal to be gilded was prepared by salts of every kind,and rubbed with pumice-stone in order to clean it thoroughly (see Chapter20), and to render the surface a little rough. This process is similar tothat used at present for gilding with amalgam, by means of heat, especiallyas amalgamation was known to the ancients. But, to speak the truth,Pliny says nothing of heating the metal <hi rend="ital">after</hi> the gold is applied, or ofevaporating the quicksilver, but of drying the cleaned metal before thegold is laid on. Had he not mentioned quicksilver, his gilding mighthave been considered as that with gold leaf by means of heat, <hi rend="ital">dorure en</hi><hi rend="ital">feuille à feu,</hi> in which the gold is laid upon the metal after it has beencleaned and heated, and strongly rubbed with blood-stone, or polished steel.Felibien (<hi rend="ital">Principes de l'Architecture.</hi> Paris, <date value="1676" authname="1676">1676</date>, p. 280) was undoubtedlyright when he regretted that the process of the ancients, the excellenceof which is proved by remains of antiquity, has been lost."—Hist. Inv.Vol. II. pp. 294, 295. <hi rend="ital">Bohn's Edition.</hi></p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Beckmann finds considerable difficulties in this description—"I acknowledgethat this passage I do not fully comprehend. It seems to saythat the quicksilver, when the gold was laid on too thin, appeared throughit, but that this might be prevented by mixing with the quicksilver thewhite of an egg. The quicksilver then remained under the gold: a thingwhich is impossible. When the smallest drop of quicksilver falls upongilding, it corrodes the noble metal, and produces an empty spot. It is,therefore, incomprehensible to me how this could be prevented by usingthe white of an egg. Did Pliny himself completely understand gilding?Perhaps he only meant to say that many artists gave out the cold-gilding.where the gold-leaf was laid on with the white of an egg, as gilding bymeans of heat."—Hist.
