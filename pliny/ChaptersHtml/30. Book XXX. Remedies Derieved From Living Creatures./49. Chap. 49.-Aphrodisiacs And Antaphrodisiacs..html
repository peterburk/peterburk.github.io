Thesame property is attributed to the excrements of snails, and topigeons' dung, taken with oil and wine. The right lobe of avulture's lungs, attached to the body in the skin of a crane,acts powerfully as a stimulant upon males: an effect equallyproduced by taking the yolks of five pigeons' eggs, in honey,mixed with one denarius of hog's lard; sparrows, or eggs ofsparrows, with the food; or by wearing the right testicle of acock, attached to the body in a ram's skin. The ashes of aburnt ibis, it is said, employed as a friction with goose-greaseand oil of iris, will prevent abortion when a female has once,conceived; while the testes of a game-cock, on the other hand,rubbed with goose-grease and attached to the body in a ram'sskin, have all the effect of an antaphrodisiac: the same, too,with the testes of any kind of dunghill cock, placed, togetherwith the blood of a cock, beneath the bed. Hairs taken from<pb n="5468" />the tail of a she-mule while being covered by the stallion, willmake a woman conceive, against her will even, if knottedtogether at the moment of the sexual congress.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> If a manmakes water upon a dog's urine, he will become disinclined tocopulation, they say.</p><p>A singular thing, too, is what is told about the ashes of aspotted lizard—if indeed it is true—to the effect that, wrappedin linen and held in the left hand, they act as an aphrodisiac,while, on the contrary, if they are transferred to the right, theywill take effect as an antaphrodisiac. A bat's blood, too, theysay, received on a flock of wool and placed beneath a woman'shead, will promote sexual desire; the same being the case alsowith a goose's tongue, taken with the food or drink.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Inter se conligatæ in coitu."</p></body>
