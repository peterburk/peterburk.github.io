<div2 type="chapter" n="93" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 93.—THREE VARIETIES OF MISTLETOE. THE NATURE OFMISTLETOE AND SIMILAR PLANTS.</head><p>There are three varieties of the mistletoe.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> That whichgrows upon the fir and the larch has the name of<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> stelis inEubœa; and there is the hyphear<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> of Arcadia. It growsalso upon the quercus,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> the robur, the holm-oak, the wildplum, and the terebinth, but upon no other tree.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> It is mostplentiful of all upon the quercus, and is then known as"adasphear." In all the trees, with the exception of the holmoak and the quercus, there is a considerable difference in itssmell and pungency, and the leaf of one kind has a disagreeable odour; both varieties, however, are sticky and bitter.The hyphear is the best for fattening<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> cattle with; it begins,however, by purging off all defects, after which it fattens allsuch animals as have been able to withstand the purging. Itis generally said, however, that those animals which have anyradical malady in the intestines cannot withstand its drasticeffects. This method of treatment is generally adopted in thesummer for a period of forty days.</p><p>Besides the above, there is yet another difference<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> in themistletoe; that which grows upon the trees which lose theirleaves, loses its leaves as well; while, on the other hand, thatwhich grows upon evergreens always retains its leaves. Inwhatever way the seed may have been sown, it will nevercome to anything, unless it has been first swallowed<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> and<pb n="3435" />then voided by birds, the wood-pigeon more particularly, andthe thrush: such being the nature of the plant, that it willnot come to anything unless the seed is first ripened in thecrop of the bird. It never exceeds a single cubit in height,and is always green and branchy. The male<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> plant is fruitful, the female barren; sometimes, indeed, the male evenbears no berry.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Viscum Europæum of modern naturalists.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Viscum album of Linnæus; but Sprengel takes it to be theLoranthus Europæus.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Fée questions whether this may not be the Loranthus Europæus.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Viscum album of Linnæus; the oak mistletoe or real mistletoe.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is not the fact: it grows upon a vast multitude of other trees.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is no longer used for this purpose.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The mistletoe never in any case loses its leaves, upon whatever treeit may grow.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is, of course, untrue; but the seeds, after being voided by birds,are more likely to adhere to the bark of trees, and so find a nidus for ger-mination.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The exact opposite is the case, the female being the fruitful plant.</p></body>
