<div2 type="chapter" n="19" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 19. (12.)—THE ISLANDS WHICH LIE BEFORE THE LANDS ALREADYMENTIONED.</head><p>Lying opposite to Thesprotia, at a distance of twelvemiles from Buthrotus, and of fifty from Acroceraunia, is theisland of Corcyra<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>, with a city of the same name, the citizens of which are free; also a town called Cassiope<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>, and atemple dedicated to Jupiter Cassius. This island is ninety-seven miles in length, and in Homer has the names ofScheria and Phæacia; while Callimachus calls it Drepane.There are some other islands around it, such as Thoronos<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>,lying in the direction of Italy, and the two islands of Paxos<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>in that of Leucadia, both of them five miles distant fromCorcyra. Not far<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> from these, and in front of Corcyra, areEricusa, Marathe, Elaphusa, Malthace, Trachie, Pythionia,Ptychia, Tarachie, and, off Phalacrum<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>, a promontory ofCorcyra, the rock into which (according to the story, whicharises no doubt from the similarity of appearance) the shipof Ulysses was changed.</p><p>Before Leucimna<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> we find the islands of Sybota, and between Leucadia and Achaia a great number of islands, amongwhich are those called Teleboïdes<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>, as also Taphiæ; by thenatives, those which lie before Leucadia are called by thenames of Taphias, Oxiæ, and Prinoessa<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>; while those thatare in front of Ætolia are the Echinades<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>, consisting ofÆgialia, Cotonis, Thyatira, Geoaris, Dionysia, Cyrnus,Chalcis, Pinara, and Mystus.<pb n="1311" /></p><p>In front of these, and lying out at sea, are Cephallenia<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> andZacynthus<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>, both of them free, Ithaca<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>,Dulichium<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>, Same<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>,and Crocyle<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span>. Cephallenia, formerly known as Melæna<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span>,lies at a distance of eleven miles from Paxos, and is ninety-three miles in circumference: its city of Same has beenlevelled to the ground by the Romans; but it still possesses threeothers<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span>. Between this island and Achaia liesthe island of Zacynthus, remarkable for its city of thesame name, and for its singular fertility. It formerly hadthe name of Hyrie, and lies to the south of Cephallenia, ata distance of twenty-five miles; in it there is the famousmountain of Elatus<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span>. This island is thirty-six miles in circumference. At a distance of fifteen miles from Zacynthusis Ithaca, in which is Mount Neritus<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span>; its circumferencein all is twenty-five miles. Twelve miles distant fromthis island is Araxus<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span>, a promontory of the Peloponnesus.Before Ithaca, lying out in the main sea, are Asteris<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> andProte; and before Zacynthus, at a distance of thirty-five miles in the direction of the south-east wind, are thetwo Strophades<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span>, by some known as the Plotæ. BeforeCephallenia lies Letoia<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span>, before Pylos the three Sphagiæ<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span>,and before Messene the Œnussæ<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span>, as many in number.<pb n="1312" /></p><p>In the Asinæan Gulf there are the three Thyrides<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span>, and inthat of Laconia Theganusa<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span>, Cothon, and Cythera<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span>, with thetown of that name, the former name of which island wasPorphyris. It is situate five miles from the promontory ofMalea<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span>, thus forming a strait very dangerous to navigation. Inthe Gulf of Argolis are Pityusa<span id="ref_31"><a href="#note_31">[31]</a></span>, Irine, and Ephyre; oppositethe territory of Hermione<span id="ref_32"><a href="#note_32">[32]</a></span>, Tiparenus, Aperopia<span id="ref_33"><a href="#note_33">[33]</a></span>,Colonis<span id="ref_34"><a href="#note_34">[34]</a></span>,and Aristera; and, opposite that of Trœzen, Calauria<span id="ref_35"><a href="#note_35">[35]</a></span>, at adistance of half a mile, Plateis<span id="ref_36"><a href="#note_36">[36]</a></span>, Belbina, Lasia, andBaucidias. Opposite Epidaurus is Cecryphalos<span id="ref_37"><a href="#note_37">[37]</a></span>, andPityonesos<span id="ref_38"><a href="#note_38">[38]</a></span>, six miles distant from the mainland; and, at adistance of fifteen miles from this last, Ægina<span id="ref_39"><a href="#note_39">[39]</a></span>, a free island,the length of which, as you sail past it, is eighteen miles.This island is twenty miles distant from Piræus, the port ofAthens: it used formerly to be called Œnone. Oppositethe promontory of Spiræum<span id="ref_40"><a href="#note_40">[40]</a></span>, lie Eleusa<span id="ref_41"><a href="#note_41">[41]</a></span>,Adendros<span id="ref_42"><a href="#note_42">[42]</a></span>, thetwo islands called Craugiæ, the two Cæciæ, SelachusaCenehreis, and Aspis; as also, in the Gulf of Megara, thefour Methurides. Ægila<span id="ref_43"><a href="#note_43">[43]</a></span> lies at a distance of fifteen miles<pb n="1313" />from Cythera, and of twenty-five from Phalasarna, a cityof Crete.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Corfu.
