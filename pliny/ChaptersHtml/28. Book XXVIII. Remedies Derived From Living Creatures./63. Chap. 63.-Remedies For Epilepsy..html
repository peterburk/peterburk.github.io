The testes,also, of swine are prescribed, dried and beaten up in sows'milk, the patient abstaining from. wine some days before andafter taking the mixture. The lights of a hare, too, are recom-mended, salted, and taken with one third of frankincense, forthirty consecutive days, in white wine: hare's rennet alsoand asses' brains, smoked with burning leaves, and administered in hydromel, in doses of half an ounce per day. Anass's hoofs are reduced to ashes, and taken for a month together, in doses of two spoonfuls; the testes, also, of an ass,salted and mixed with the drink, asses' milk or water in particular. The secundines, also, of a she-ass are recommended,more particularly when it is a male that has been foaled: placedbeneath the nostrils of the patient, when the fits are likely tocome on, this substance will effectually repel them.<pb n="5354" /></p><p>There are some persons who recommend the patient to eatthe heart of a black he-ass in the open air with bread, uponthe first or second day of the moon: others, again, prescribethe flesh of that animal, and others the blood, diluted withvinegar, and taken for forty days together. Some mix horse-stale for this purpose, with smithy water fresh from the forge,employing the same mixture for the cure of delirium. Epilepsyis also treated with mares' milk, or the excrescences from ahorse's legs, taken in honey and vinegar. The magicianshighly recommend goats' flesh, grilled upon a funeral pile; asalso the suet of that animal, boiled with an equal quantity ofbull's gall, and kept in the gall-bladder; care being taken notto let it touch the ground, and the patient swallowing it inwater, standing aloft.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> The smell arising from a goat's hornsor deer's antlers, burnt, efficiently detects the presence ofepilepsy.</p><p>In cases where persons are suddenly paralyzed, the urine ofan ass's foal, applied to the body with nard, is very useful, it is</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Potum vero ex aqua sublime."
