(8.)—ARINCA, AND OTHER KINDS OF GRAIN THAT ARE GROWN IN THE EAST.</head><p>The several kinds of corn are not everywhere the same; andeven where they are the same, they do not always bear a similar name. The kinds most universally grown are spelt, by theancients known as "adorea," winter wheat,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and wheat;<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> allthese being common to many countries. Arinca was originallypeculiar to Gaul, though now it is widely diffused over Italyas well. Egypt, too, Syria, Cilicia, Asia, and Greece, have theirown peculiar kinds, known by the names of zea,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> olyra, andwheat.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> In Egypt, they make a fine flour from wheat of theirown growth, but it is by no means equal to that of Italy.Those countries which employ zea, have no spelt. Zea, however, is to be found in Italy, and in Campania more particularly,where it is known by the name of "seed."<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> The grain thatbears this name enjoys a very considerable celebrity, as weshall have occasion to state<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> on another occasion; and it is inhonour of this that Homer<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> uses the expression, <foreign lang="greek">zei/dwros a)/roura,</foreign>and not, as some suppose, from the fact of the earthgiving life.<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> Amylum is made, too, from this grain, but of a<pb n="4032" />coarser<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> quality than the kind already mentioned;<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> this,however, is the only difference that is perceptible.</p><p>The most hardy kind, however, of all the grains is spelt, andthe best to stand the severity of the weather; it will grow inthe very coldest places, as also in localities that are but halftilled, or soils that are extremely hot, and destitute of water.This was the earliest food of the ancient inhabitants of Latium;a strong proof of which is the distributions of adorea thatwere made in those times, as already stated.<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> It is evident,too, that the Romans subsisted for a long time upon pottage,<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>and not bread; for we find that from its name of "puls," certain kinds of food are known, even at the present day, as "pulmentaria."<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> Ennius, too, the most ancient of our poets, indescribing the famine in a siege, relates how that the parentssnatched away the messes of pottage<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> from their weepingchildren. At the present day, even, the sacrifices in conformitywith the ancient rites, as well as those offered upon birthdays,are made with parched pottage.<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> This food appears to havebeen as much unknown in those days in Greece as polenta wasin Italy.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Siligo.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Triticum.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Triticum dicoccum, or spelt.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably rye.
