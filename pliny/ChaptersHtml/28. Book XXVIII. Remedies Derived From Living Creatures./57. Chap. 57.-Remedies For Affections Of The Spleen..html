The miltof a cow or ox is used in a similar manner; but when it isquite fresh, the practice is to roast or boil it and take it withthe food. For pains in the liver a topical application is madeby bruising twenty heads of garlick in one sextarius of vinegar,and applying them in a piece of ox bladder. For the samemalady the magicians recommend a calf's milt, bought at theprice set upon it and without any haggling, that being animportant point, and one that should be religiously observed.This done, the milt must be cut in two lengthwise, and attached<pb n="5346" />to the patient's shirt,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> on either side; after which, the patientmust put it on and let the pieces fall at his feet, and mustthen pick them up, and dry them in the shade. While thislast is doing, the diseased liver of the patient will graduallycontract, they say, and he will eventually be cured. Thelights, too, of a fox are very useful for this purpose, dried onhot ashes and taken in water; the same, too, with a kid'smilt, applied to the part affected.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This would appear to be a Greek word in reality.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Tunica."</p></body>
