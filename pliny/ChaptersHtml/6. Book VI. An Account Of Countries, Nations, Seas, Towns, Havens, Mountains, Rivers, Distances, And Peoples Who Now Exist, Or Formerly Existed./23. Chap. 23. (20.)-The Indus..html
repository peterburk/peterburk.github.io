<div2 type="chapter" n="23" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 23. (20.)ÑTHE INDUS.</head><p>The Indus, called Sindis by the natives, rises in that branchof the Caucasian range which bears the name of Paropanisus,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span><pb n="2047" />and runs in an easterly direction, receiving in its course thewaters of nineteen rivers. The most famous of these are theHydaspes,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> into which four other rivers have already discharged themselves, the Cantaba,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> which receives three otherrivers, the Acesinus, and the Hypasis,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> which last two arenavigable themselves. Still however, so moderate, as it were,do the waters of this river show themselves in their course,that it is never more than fifty stadia in width, nor does itever exceed fifteen paces in depth. Of two islands, which itforms in its course, the one, which is known as Prasiane, is ofvery considerable size; the other, which is smaller, is calledPatale. According to the accounts given by the most moderate writers, this river is navigable for a distance of twelvehundred and fifty miles, and after following the sun's course tothe west, in some degree, discharges itself into the ocean. I willhere give the distances of various places situate on the coast tothe mouth of this river, in a general way, just as I find themstated, although they none of them tally with each other.</p><p>From the mouth of the Ganges to the Promontory of theCalingi and the town of Dandaguda,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> is six hundred andtwenty-five miles; from thence to Tropina twelve hundred andtwenty-five; from thence to the promontory of Perimula,where is held the most celebrated mart in all India, sevenhundred and fifty, and from thence to the city of Patala, in theisland just mentioned, six hundred and twenty miles.</p><p>The mountain races between the Indus and the Jomanes arethe Cesi,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> the Cetriboni, who dwell in the woods, and after themthe Megall¾, whose king possesses five hundred elephants, andan army of horse and foot, the numbers of which are unknown;then the Chrysei, the Parasang¾, and the Asmagi,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> whose territory is infested by wild tigers; these people keep in arms thirty<pb n="2048" />thousand foot, three hundred elephants, and eight hundredhorse. They are bounded by the river Indus, and encircled bya range of mountains and deserts for a distance of six hundredand twenty-five miles. Below these deserts are the Dari andthe Surve, and then deserts again for one hundred and eighty-seven miles, sands in general encircling these spots just asislands are surrounded by the sea. Below these deserts, again,are the Maltecor¾, the Sing¾, the Maroh¾, the Rarung¾,and the Morontes. These last peoples, who possess themountains throughout the whole range of country as faras the shores of the ocean, are free, and independent of allkings, and hold numerous cities upon the declivities of themountains. After them come the Nare¾,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> who are boundedby Capitalia, the most lofty of all the Indian peaks: the inhabitants who dwell on the other side of it have extensivemines of gold and silver. After these again are the Orat¾, whoseking possesses only ten elephants, but a large army of foot;next come the Suaratarat¾, who live under the rule of a kingas well, but breed no elephants, as they depend solely on theirhorse and foot; then the Odonbeores, the Arabastree, and theHorac¾, which last inhabit a fine city fortified by trenches cutin the marshes. It is quite impossible to approach the city,except by the bridge, as the water in the trenches is full ofcrocodiles, an animal most insatiate for human flesh. Thereis another city also in their territory, which has been greatlyextolled, Automula by name, situate on the sea-shore, afamous mart, lying at the point of confluence of five rivers:their king possesses sixteen hundred elephants, one hundredand fifty thousand foot, and five thousand horse. The king ofthe Charm¾ is a less opulent potentate; he has only sixtyelephants and some small remains of his former strength.After these we come to the nation of the Pand¾,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> the only onethroughout all India which is ruled by women. It is saidthat Hercules had but one child of the female sex, for whichreason she was his especial favourite, and he bestowed uponher the principal one of these kingdoms. The sovereigns who<pb n="2049" />derive their origin from this female, rule over three hundredtowns, and have an army of one hundred and fifty thousandfoot, and five hundred elephants. After passing through thislist of three hundred cities, we come to the Darang¾,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> thePosing¾, the But¾, the Gogar¾i, the Umbr¾, the Nere¾, theBrancosi, the Nobund¾, the Cocond¾, the Nesei, the Palatit¾,the Salobrias¾, and the Olostr¾, who reach up to the islandof Patala, from the extremity of whose shores to the CaspianGates it is a distance of nineteen hundred and twenty-fivemiles.</p><p>After passing this island, the other side of the Indus is occupied, as we know by clear and undoubted proofs, by theAtho¾, the Boling¾, the Gallitalut¾, the Dimuri, the Megari,the Ardab¾, the Mes¾, and after them, the Uri and the Sil¾;beyond which last there are desert tracts, extending a distanceof two hundred and fifty miles. After passing these nations,we come to the Organag¾, the Abort¾, the Bassuert¾, and,after these last, deserts similar to those previously 'mentioned.We then come to the peoples of the Sorofages, the Arb¾,the Marogomatr¾, the Umbritt¾, of whom there are twelve nations, each with two cities, and the Asini, a people who dwellin three cities, their capital being Bucephala,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> which wasfounded around the tomb of the horse belonging to king Alexander, which bore that name. Above these peoples there aresome mountain tribes, which lie at the foot of Caucasus, theSosead¾ and the Sondr¾, and, after passing the Indus andgoing down its stream, the Samarabri¾, the Sambraceni, theBisambrit¾, the Orsi, the Anixeni, and the Taxil¾, with afamous city, which lies on a low but level plain, the generalname of the district being Amenda: there are four nations<pb n="2050" />here, the Peucolait¾,<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> the Arsagalit¾, the Geret¾, and theAsso•.</p><p>The greater part of the geographers, in fact, do not lookupon India as bounded by the river Indus, but add to it thefour Satrapies of the Gedrosi,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> the Arachot¾,<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> the Arii,<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> andthe Paropauisid¾,<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> the river Cophes<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> thus forming the extremeboundary of India. All these territories, however, accordingto other writers, are reckoned as belonging to the country ofthe Arii. (21.) Many writers, too, place in India the city ofNysa,<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> and the mountain of Merus, sacred to Father Bacchus;in which circumstance<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> originated the story that he sprang fromthe thigh of Jupiter. They also place here the nation of theAstacani, whose country abounds in the vine, the laurel, thebox-tree, and all the fruits which are produced in Greece. Asto those wonderful and almost fabulous stories which are related about the fertility of the soil, and the various kinds offruits and trees, as well as wild beasts, and birds, and othersorts of animals, they shall be mentioned each in its proper<pb n="2051" />place, in a future portion of this work. I shall also veryshortly have to make some further mention of the four Satrapies,it being at present my wish to hasten to a description of theisland of Taprobane.</p><p>But first there are some other islands of which we mustmake mention. Patala,<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> as we have already stated, lies atthe mouth of the Indus: it is of a triangular figure, and is twohundred and twenty miles in breadth. Beyond the mouth ofthe Indus are the islands of Chryse and Argyre,<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> abounding inmetals, I believe; but as to what some persons have stated,that their soil consists of gold and silver, I am not so willingto give a ready credence to that. After passing these islandswe come to Crocala,<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> twenty miles in breadth, and then, attwelve miles' distance from it, Bibraga,<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span> abounding in oystersand other bell-fish. At eight miles' distance from Bibraga wefind Toralliba, and many others of no note.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or Hindoo Koosh.

The exact site of thisplace is not known, but the probabilities appear in favour of Jhelum, atwhich place is the usual passage of the river, or else of Jellapoor, aboutsixteen miles lower down.78 Probably the same that is mentioned in c. 21 of the present Book.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Parisot supposes that these were the inhabitants of the district whichnow bears the name of Pekheli.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Gedrosia comprehended probably the same district as is now knownby the name of Mekran, or, according to some, the whole of modern Beloochistan.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The people of the city and district of Arachotus, the capital of Ara-ehosia.

ColonelRawlinson thinks they are those to be seen at a place called Ulan Robat.He states that the most ancient name of the city, Cophen, (mentioned byPliny in c. 25 of the present Book), has given rise to the territorial desig-nation.
