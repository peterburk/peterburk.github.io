In the maritime parts of Cantabria<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> which are<pb n="6210" />washed by the Ocean, there is a steep and lofty mountain,which, however incredible it may appear, is entirely composedof this metal, as already stated in our description of the partsbordering upon the Ocean<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span></p><p>Iron which has been acted upon by fire is spoiled, unless itis forged with the hammer. It is not in a fit state for beinghammered when it is red-hot, nor, indeed, until it has begun toassume a white heat. By sprinkling vinegar or alum upon it,it acquires the appearance of copper. It is protected fromrust by an application of ceruse, gypsum, and tar; a propertyof iron known by the Greeks as "antipathia."<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> Some pretend,too, that this may be ensured by the performance of certainreligious ceremonies, and that there is in existence at thecity of Zeugma,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> upon the Euphrates, an iron chain, by meansof which Alexander the Great constructed a bridge across theriver; the links of which that have been replaced are attackedwith rust, while the original links are totally exemptfrom it.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We learn from Bowles that the celebrated mine of Sommorostro isstill worked for this metal.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. iv. c. 34.—B.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Both the reading and the meaning of this passage are very doubtful.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. v. c. 21.—B.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We may presume that Pliny supposed that the ancient links hadbeen protected by some of the substances mentioned above, although thisis not distinctly stated.—B.
