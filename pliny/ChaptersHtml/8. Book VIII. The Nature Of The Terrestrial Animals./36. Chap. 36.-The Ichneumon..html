It plunges itself repeatedly into themud, and then dries itself in the sun: as soon as, by thesemeans, it has armed itself with a sufficient number of coatings,it proceeds to the combat. Raising its tail, and turning itsback to the serpent, it receives its stings, which are inflicted tono purpose, until at last, turning its head sideways, and viewing its enemy, it seizes it by the throat. Not content, however, with this victory, it conquers another creature also, whichis no less dangerous.</p></div2></body>
