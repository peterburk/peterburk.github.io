<div2 type="chapter" n="15" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 15. (10.)—MAGNA GRÆCIA, BEGINNING AT LOCRI.</head><p>At Locri begins the fore-part of Italy, called MagnaGræcia, whose coast falls back in three bays<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> formed by theAusonian sea, so called from the Ausones, who were thefirst inhabitants of the country. According to Varro it is86 miles in extent; but most writers have made it only 75.Along this coast there are rivers innumerable, but we shallmention those only that are worthy of remark. Afterleaving Locri we come to the Sagra<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>, and the ruins of thetown of Caulon, Mystiæ<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>, Consilinum Castrum<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, Cocinthum<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>, in the opinion of some, the longest headland of Italy,and then the Gulf of Scylacium<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>, and Scylacium<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> itself,<pb n="1223" />which was called by the Athenians, when they founded it,Scylletium. This part of Italy is nearly a peninsula, in consequence of the Gulf of Terinæum<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> running up into it on theother side; in it there is a harbour called Castra Hannibalis<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>:in no part is Italy narrower than here, it being but twentymiles across. For this reason the Elder Dionysius entertained the idea of severing<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> this portion from the main-landof Italy at this spot, and adding it to Sicily. The navigable rivers in this district are the Carcines<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>, the Crotalus,the Semirus, the Arocas, and the Targines. In the interioris the town of Petilia<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>, and there are besides, Mount Clibanus<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>, the promontory of Lacinium, in front of which liesthe island of Dioscoron<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>, ten miles from the main-land, andanother called the Isle of Calypso, which Homer is supposedto refer to under the name of Ogygia; as also the islands ofTiris, Eranusa, and Meloessa. According to Agrippa, thepromontory of Lacinium<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> is seventy miles from Caulon.</p><p>(11.) At the promontory of Lacinium begins the secondGulf of Europe, the bend of which forms an are of greatdepth, and terminates at Acroceraunium, a promontory ofEpirus, from which it is distant<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> seventy-five miles. Wefirst come to the town of Croton<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span>, and then the river<pb n="1224" />Neæthus<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span>, and the town of Thurii<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span>, situate between the tworivers Crathis and Sybaris, upon the latter of which there wasonce a city<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> of the same name. In a similar manner Heraclia<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span>, sometimes called Siris, lies between the river of thatname and the Aciris. We next come to the rivers Acalandrus and Casuentum<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span>, and the town of Metapontum<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span>,with which the third region of Italy terminates. In theinterior of Bruttium, the Aprustani<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span> are the only people;but in Lucania we find the Atinates, the Bantini, the Eburini<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span>, the Grumentini, the Potentini, the Sontini<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span>, the Sirini,the Tergilani, the Ursentini, and the Volcentani<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span>, whomthe Numestrani join. Besides these, we learn from Cato<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span>that Thebes in Lucania has disappeared, and Theopompusinforms us that there was formerly a city of the Lucani calledPandosia<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span>, at which Alexander, the king of Epirus, died.<pb n="1225" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">These are the Gulf of Locri, the Gulf of Scyllacium, and the Gulf of Tarentum.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called the Sagriano, though some make it to be the modern Alaro.

No ruins of the ancient city, said by Livy to have been twelve miles in circumference, are now remaining. The modern Cotrone occupies a part of its site.

Atina was situate in the valley of the Tanager, now the Valle di Diano. The ruins of Atina, which are very extensive, are to be seen near the village of Atena. Livy and Acron speak of Bantia as in Apulia, and not in Lucania. An ancient abbey, Santa Maria di Vanze, still marks its site.</p><p><span id="note_25"><a href="#ref_25">25. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The ruins of Eburi are supposed to be those between the modern Eboli and the right bank of the Silarus.

(in the year B.C. <date value="-326" authname="-326">326</date>) was obliged to engage under unfavourable circumstances near Pandosia, on the Acheron, and fell as he was crossing the river; thus accomplishing a prophecy of Dodona which had warned him to beware of Pandosia and the Acheron. He was uncle to Alexander the Great, being the brother of Olympias. The site of Pandosia is supposed to have been the modern Castro Franco.</p></body>
