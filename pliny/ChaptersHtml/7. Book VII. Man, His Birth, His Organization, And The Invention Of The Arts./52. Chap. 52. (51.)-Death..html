Amongthese are laughter, in madness<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> in cases of delirium,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> thepatient carefully folding the fringe or the plaits of the bed-<pb n="2209" />clothes;<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> insensibility to the attempts of those who would rousethem from sleep; and involuntary discharges from the body,which it is not necessary here to particularize; but the most unequivocal signs of all, are certain appearances of the eyes andthe nose, a lying posture with the face continually upwards, anirregular and feeble motion of the pulse,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and the other symptoms, which have been observed by that prince of physicians,Hippocrates. At the same time that there are innumerablesigns of death, there are none of health and safety; so muchso, that Cato the Censor, when speaking to his son in relationto those who appear to be in good health, declared, as thoughit had been the enunciation of some oracle,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> that precocity inyouth is a sign of an early death.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span></p><p>The number of diseases is infinite. Pherecydes of Scyros diedfrom vast numbers of worms issuing from his body.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> Somepersons are distressed by a perpetual fever; such was the casewith C. M¾cenas; during the last three years of his life, hecould never get a single moment's sleep.<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> Antipater of Sidon,the poet, was attacked with fever every year, and that only onhis birthday; he died of it at, an advanced age.<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span><pb n="2210" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Dalechamps correctly remarks, that the laughter here referred to, isnot the indication of mirth, but what has been termed the "risus Sardonicus," the "Sardonic laugh," produced by a convulsive action of themuscles of the face; Lemaire, vol. iii. p. 201.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Sapientit¾ ¾gritudine." See Note 80 above.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny probably took this notion from Celsus, who speaks of this asbeing a fatal symptom, B. ii. c. 6; "si manibus qui in febre, &amp;c., in vestefloccos legit, fimbriasque diducit. . . ."ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Venarum percussa;" the ancients were not acquainted with therelation which exists between the arteries and the veins, or the appropriatefunctions of these parts.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In Seneca, Contr. B. ii., we find the remark, "Suchgenius, at soearly an age, bodes no long life." Apuleius, quoting from some Greekwriter, says, "Odi puerulos pr¾coci sapienti‰." "I hate your bits of boys,with their precocious wisdom." We have a somewhat similar saying tothe above passage from Seneca, "He is too wise," or "too clever to livelong."</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This remark has been confirmed by various writers, ancient and modern;it appears to depend upon an unnatural development of the cerebral andnervous system, which renders it more liable to disease, and less able tobear the impressions to which it is ordinarily exposed.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This was probably Phthiriasis, or the "morbus pediculosus," whichhas been previously mentioned in this book with reference to Sulla, and ofwhich, probably, Herod Agrippa died. Some authors state that Pherecydes put an end to his life by throwing himself from a rock at Delphi;others give other accounts of his death.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This circumstance is mentioned by Seneca, De Provid. c. 3.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We have the same account of Antipater in Valerius Maximus, B. i.c. 8. He was the preceptor of Cato of Utica; Cicero makes honourablemention of him, De Oratore, B. iii. c. 50.ÑB.</p></body>
