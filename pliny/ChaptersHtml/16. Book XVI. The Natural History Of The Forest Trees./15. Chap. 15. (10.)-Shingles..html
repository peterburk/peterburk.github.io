(10.)—SHINGLES.</head><p>The best shingles are those made of the wood of the robur;the next best being those furnished by the other glandiferoustrees and the beech. Those most easily made are cut fromthe wood of the resinous trees, but they do not last,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>with the exception of those made of pine. CorneliusNepos informs us, that Rome was roofed solely with shinglesdown to the time of the war with Pyrrhus, a period of fourhundred and seventy years. It is well known that it wasremarkable for the fine forests in its vicinity. Even at thepresent day, the name of Jupiter Fagutalus points out inwhat locality there stood a grove of beeches;<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> the Querquetulan Gate shows where the quercus once stood, and the Viminal Hill is the spot where the "vimen"<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> was sought inancient times. In many other parts, too, there were grovesto be found, and sometimes as many as two. Q. Hortensius,the Dictator, on the secession of the plebeians to the Janiculum, passed a law in the Æsculetum,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> that what the plebeians had enacted should be binding upon every Romancitizen.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">On the contrary, Fée says, the resinous woods are the most proof ofall against the action of the air.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Festus says that the Fagutal, a shrine of Jupiter, was so called froma beech tree (fagus) that stood there, and was sacred to that god.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or osier.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "plantation of the æsculus."</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A.U.C. 367.</p></body>
