<div2 type="chapter" n="43" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 43.â€”THE FOOD OF BEES.</head><p>In relation to the food of bees, I have ascertained a verysingular fact, and one that well deserves to be mentioned.<pb n="4341" />There is a village, called Hostilia, on the banks of the riverPadus: the inhabitants of it, when food<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> fails the bees in theirvicinity, place the hives in boats and convey them some fivemiles up the river in the night. In the morning the bees goforth to feed, and then return to the boats; their localitybeing changed from day to day, until at last, as the boats sinkdeeper and deeper in the water, it is ascertained that the hivesare full, upon which they are taken home, and the honey iswithdrawn.</p><p>(13.) In Spain, too, for the same purpose, they have thehives carried from place to place on the backs of mules.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This plan is still adopted on the river Po, the ancient Padus, as alsoat Beauce, in the south of France, where the hives are carried from placeto place upon carts. In the north of England it is the practice to carrythe hives to the moors in autumn.</p></body>
