<div2 type="chapter" n="42" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 42.—GALATIA AND THE ADJOINING NATIONS.</head><p>On this occasion also it seems that we ought to speak ofGalatia<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>, which lies above Phrygia, and includes the greaterpart of the territory taken from that province, as also its<pb n="1492" />former capital, Gordium<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>. The Gauls<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> who have settled inthese parts, are called the Tolistobogi, the Voturi, and theAmbitouti; those who dwell in Mæonia and Paphlagoniaare called the Trocmi. Cappadocia stretches along to thenorth-east of Galatia, its most fertile parts being possessedby the Tectosages and the Teutobodiaci. These are thenations by which those parts are occupied; and they aredivided into peoples and tetrarchies, 195 in number. Itstowns are, among the Tectosages, Ancyra<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>; among theTroemi, Tavium<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>; and, among the Tolistobogi, Pessinus<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>.Besides the above, the best known among the peoples ofthis region are the Actalenses, the Arasenses, the Comenses<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>,the Didienses, the Hierorenses, the Lystreni<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>, theNeapolitani, the Œandenses, the Seleucenses<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>, the Sebas-<pb n="1493" />teni<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>, the Timoniacenses<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>, and the Thebaseni<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>.Galatia also touches upon Carbalia in Pamphylia, and theMilyæ<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>, about Baris; also upon Cyllanticum andOroandicum<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>, a district of Pisidia, and Obizene, a part ofLvcaonia. Besides those already mentioned<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>, its rivers are theSangarius<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> and the Gallus<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span>, from which last thepriests<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> of the Mother of the gods have taken their name.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">7 It was bounded on the west, south, and south-east by thosecountries; and on the north-east, north, and north-west by Pontus,Paphlagouia, and Bithynia.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Mentioned in C. 40, under the name of Gordiucome.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Who invaded and settled in Asia Minor, at various periods during the third century B.C.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Near a small stream, which seems to enter the Sangarius. It originally belonged to Phrygia, and its mythical founder was Midas, the son of Gordius, who was said to have found an anchor on the spot, and accordingly given the name to the town; which story would, however, as it has been observed, imply that the name for anchor (<foreign lang="greek">a)/gkura</foreign>) was the same in the Greek and the Phrygian languages. The Tectosages, who settled here about B.C. <date value="-277" authname="-277">277</date>, are supposed to have been from the neighbourhood of Toulouse. It is now called Angora, or Engareh; and the fine hair of the Angora goat may have formed one of the staple commodities of the place, which had a very considerable trade. The chief monument of antiquity here is the marble temple of the Emperor Augustus, built in his honour during his lifetime. In the inside is the Latin inscription known as the <hi rend="ital">monumentum,</hi> or <hi rend="ital">marmor Ancyranum,</hi> containing a record of the memorable actions of Augustus. The ruins here are otherwise interesting in a high degree.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Tchoroum, according to Ansart.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Its ruins are called Bala-Hisar, in the south-west of Galatia, on the southern slope of Mount Didymus.
