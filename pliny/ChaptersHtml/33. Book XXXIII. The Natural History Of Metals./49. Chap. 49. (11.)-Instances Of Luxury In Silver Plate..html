(11.)—INSTANCES OF LUXURY IN SILVER PLATE.</head><p>The caprice of the human mind is marvellously exemplifiedin the varying fashions of silver plate; the work of no individualmanufactory being for any long time in vogue. At oneperiod, the Furnian plate, at another the Clodian, and atanother the Gratian,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> is all the rage—for we borrow the shopeven at our tables.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>—Now again, it is embossed plate<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> that<pb n="6132" />we are in search of, and silver deeply chiselled around themarginal lines of the figures painted<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> upon it; and now we arebuilding up on our sideboards fresh tiers<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> of tables for supportingthe various dishes. Other articles of plate we nicelypare away,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> it being an object that the file may remove asmuch of the metal as possible.</p><p>We find the orator Calvus complaining that the saucepansare made of silver; but it has been left for us to invent a planof covering our very carriages<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> with chased silver, and it wasin our own age that Poppæa, the wife of the Emperor Nero,ordered her favourite mules to be shod even with gold!</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">So called from the silversmiths who respectively introduced them.The Gratian plate is mentioned by Martial, B. iv. Epigr. 39.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Etenim tabernas mensis adoptamus."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Anaglypta." Plate chased in relief. It is mentioned in the Epigramof Martial above referred to.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Asperitatemque exciso circa liniarum picturas,"—a passage, theobscurity of which, as Littré remarks, seems to set translation at defiance.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He alludes, probably to tiers of shelves on the beaufets or sideboards—"repositoria"—similar to those used for the display of plate in themiddle ages. Petronius Arbiter speaks of a round "repositorium,"which seems to have borne a considerable resemblance to our "dumbwaiters." The "repositoria" here alluded to by Pliny were probablymade of silver.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Interradimus."</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Carrucæ." The "carruca" was a carriage, the name of whichonly occurs under the emperors, the present being the first mention of it.It had four wheels and was used in travelling, like the "carpentum."Martial, B. iii. Epig. 47, uses the word as synonymous with "rheda."Alexander Severus allowed the senators to have them plated with silver.The name is of Celtic origin, and is the basis of the mediæval word "carucate,"and the French <hi rend="ital">carrosse.</hi></p></body>
