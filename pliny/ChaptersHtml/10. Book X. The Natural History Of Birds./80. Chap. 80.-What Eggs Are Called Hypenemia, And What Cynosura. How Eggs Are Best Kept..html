HOW EGGS ARE BEST KEPT.</head><p>The barren eggs, which we have mentioned as "hypenemia,"are either conceived by the females when they are influencedby libidinous fancies, and couple with one another, or else atthe moment when they are rolling themselves in the dust;they are produced not only by the pigeon, but by the commonhen as well, the partridge, the pea-hen, the goose, and thechenalopex; these eggs are barren, smaller than the others, ofa less agreeable flavour, and more humid. There are somewho think that they are generated by the wind, for whichreason they give them the name of "zephyria." The eggsknown as "urina," and which by some are called "cy-nosura,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> are only laid in the spring, and at a time when thehen has discontinued sitting. Eggs, if soaked in vinegar, arerendered so soft thereby, that they may be twisted<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> roundthe finger like a ring. The best method of preserving them isto keep them packed in bean-meal, or chaff, during thewinter, and in bran during the summer. It is a general belief, that if kept in salt, they will lose their contents.<pb n="2540" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Dog's-urine."
