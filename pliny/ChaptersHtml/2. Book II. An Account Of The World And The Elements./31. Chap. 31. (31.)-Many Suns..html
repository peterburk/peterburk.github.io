(31.)ÑMANY SUNS.</head><p>And again, many suns have been seen at the same time<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>; notabove or below the real sun, but in an oblique direction, nevernear nor opposite to the earth, nor in the night, but eitherin the east or in the west. They are said to have been seenonce at noon in the Bosphorus, and to have continued frommorning until sunset. Our ancestors have frequently seenthree suns at the same time<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>, as was the case in the consulship ofSp. Postumius and L. Mucius, of L. Marcius andM. Portius, that of M. Antony and Dolabella, and that ofM. Lepidus and L. Plancus. And we have ourselves seenone during the reign of the late Emperor Claudius, when he<pb n="1063" />was consul along with Corn. Orfitus. We have no accounttransmitted to us of more than three having been seen atthe same time.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle, Meteor. lib. iii. cap. 2. p. 575, cap. 6. p. 582, 583, andSeneca, Qu¾st.
