<div2 type="chapter" n="3" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 3.—EXOTIC TREES. WHEN THE PLANE-TREE FIRSTAPPEARED IN ITALY, AND WHENCE IT CAME.</head><p>But who is there that will not, with good reason, be surprised to learn that a tree has been introduced among us froma foreign clime for nothing but its shade? I mean the plane,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>which was first brought across the Ionian Sea to the Isle<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> ofDiomedes, there to be planted at his tomb, and was afterwardsimported thence into Sicily, being one of the very first exotictrees that were introduced into Italy. At the present day,however, it has penetrated as far as the country of theMorini, and occupies even a tributary<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> soil; in return for which<pb n="3104" />those nations have to pay a tax for the enjoyment of its shade.Dionysius the Elder, one of the tyrants of Sicily, had plane-trees conveyed to the city of Rhegium, where they were lookedupon as the great marvel of his palace, which was afterwardsconverted into a gymnasium. These trees did not, however,in that locality, attain any very great height. I find it alsostated by some authors, that there were some other instances,in those days even, of plane-trees being found in Italy, and Ifind some mentioned by name as existing in Spain.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Platanus orientalis of Linnæus.

Pliny, probably, when his secretary was reading to him,mistook the word <foreign lang="greek">spani/an,</foreign> "rare," for <foreign lang="greek">)Ispani/a|,</foreign> "in Spain."</p></body>
