Enorchis<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> is a white stone, the fragmentsof which, when it is split asunder, resemble the testesin shape. Exebenus, Zoroaster tells us, is a white, handsomestone, employed by goldsmiths for polishing gold. Erythallis,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>though a white stone, assumes a red hue when viewed at aninclined angle. Erotyles,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> also known as "amphicomos"<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>and "hieromnemon,"<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> is highly praised by Democritus for itsuse in the art of divination.</p><p>Eumeces<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> is a stone of Bactriana, like silex in appearance;placed beneath the head, it produces visions in the night of anoracular description. Eumithres<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> is called by the Assyrians"gem of Belus,"<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> the most sacred of all their gods; it is of aleek-green colour, and greatly in request for superstitious purposes.Eupetalos<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> is a stone that has four different tints,azure, fiery, vermilion, and apple-colour. Eureos<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> is similarto an olive-stone in form, streaked like a shell, and moderatelywhite. Eurotias<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> has all the appearance of concealing its<pb n="6449" />black colour beneath a coat of mould. Eusebes<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> is the stone,it is said, of which the seat was made in the Temple ofHercules at Tyrus, from which the pious [only] could raisethemselves without difficulty. Epimelas<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> is a white gem,with a black hue reflected from its surface.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Heart-shaped." A tarquois, Hardouin thinks. See "Bucardia"in Chapter 55 above.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"The best."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Formed like the testes."</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Red stone," apparently. The reading is very doubtful.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The reading is doubtful, but the word may possibly mean "stone oflove," or something equivalent.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Fine-haired."</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Skilled in sacred matters."</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Of fair length." Ajasson thinks that this may have been a varietyof Pyromachic silex, or gun flint, nearly allied to Chalcedony.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A preferable reading, probably, to "Eumitres." It perhaps took itsname from Mithres, the god of the Sun among the Persians, and meant"blessing of Mithres." Ajasson thinks that it may have been green Tourmaline,and that its electric properties may have been very "serviceable tothe charlatans who had the monopoly of the Temple of Bel."</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See Chapter 55 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"With beautiful leaves." By some authorities this is thought to beOpal, by others Heliotrope or Bloodstone. Ajasson thinks that it mayhave been a general name for Jasper quartz, or else that it was Quartzagate opalized.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This reading is very doubtful.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Mouldy stone."</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Stone of the religious."</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Black on the surface." This is the case, Ajasson remarks, withmany stones of the class known as "Cat's eye."</p></body>
