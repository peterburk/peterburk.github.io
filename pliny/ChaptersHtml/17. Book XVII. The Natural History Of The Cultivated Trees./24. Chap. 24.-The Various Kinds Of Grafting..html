<div2 type="chapter" n="24" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 24.—THE VARIOUS KINDS OF GRAFTING.</head><p>A different mode of engrafting, however, has been taught us<pb n="3478" />by chance, another great instructor, and one from whom, perhaps, we have learnt a still greater number of lessons. Acareful husbandman,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> being desirous, for its better protection,to surround his cottage with a palisade, thrust the stakesinto growing ivy, in order to prevent them from rotting.Seized by the tenacious grasp of the still living ivy, the stakesborrowed life from the life of another wood, and it was foundthat the stock of a tree acted in place of earth.</p><p>For this method of grafting the surface is made level with asaw, and the stock carefully smoothed with the pruning-knife.This done, there are two modes of proceeding, the first ofwhich consists in grafting between the bark and the wood.The ancients were fearful at first of cutting into the wood, butafterwards they ventured to pierce it to the very middle, andinserted the graft in the pith, taking care to enclose but one,because the pith, they thought, was unable to receive more. Animproved method has, however, in more recent times, allowedof as many as six grafts being inserted, it being considereddesirable by additional numbers to make a provision for thecontingency of some of them not surviving. With this view,an incision is carefully made in the middle of the stock, a thinwedge being inserted to prevent the sides from closing, untilthe graft, the end of which is first cut to a point, has been letinto the fissure. In doing this many precautions are necessary, and more particularly every care should be taken thatthe stock is that of a tree suitable for the purpose, and thatthe graft is taken from one that is proper for grafting. Thesap,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> too, is variously distributed in the several trees, and doesnot occupy the same place in all. In the vine and the fig<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> themiddle of the tree is the driest, and it is in the summit thatthe generative power resides; hence it is, that from the topthe grafts are selected. In the olive, again, the sap lies in the<pb n="3479" />middle of the tree, and the grafts are accordingly taken fromthence: the upper part being comparatively dry. The grafttakes most easily in a tree, the bark of which is of a similar<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>nature to its own, and which, blossoming at the same time asitself, has an affinity with it in the development of the naturaljuices. On the other hand, the process of uniting is but slowwhere the dry is brought in contact with the moist, and thehard bark with the soft.</p><p>The other points to be observed are the following: the incision must not be made in a knot, as such an inhospitable rigiditywill certainly repel the stranger plant; the incision should bemade, too, in the part which is most compact, and it must notbe much more than three fingers in length, not in a slantingdirection, nor yet such as to pierce the tree from side to side.Virgil<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> is of opinion, that the grafts should not be taken from thetop, and it is universally agreed that it is best to select them fromthe shoulders of the tree which look towards the north-east;<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>from a tree, too, that is a good bearer, and from a young shoot,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>unless, indeed, the graft is intended for an old tree, in whichcase it should be of a more robust growth. In addition to this,the graft ought to be in a state of impregnation, that is to say,swelling<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> with buds, and giving every promise of bearing thesame year; it ought, too, to be two years old, and not thinnerthan the little finger. The graft is inserted at the smallerend, when it is the object of the grower that it should notgrow to any considerable length, but spread out on either side.But it is more particularly necessary that the buds upon thegraft should be smooth and regular, and there must be nothingupon it at all scabbed or shrivelled. Success may be fullyreckoned on if the pith of the graft is brought in contact withthe wood and bark of the stock; that being a much better planthan merely uniting them bark to bark. In pointing the graft,<pb n="3480" />the pith ought not to be laid bare; still, however, it should bepared with a small knife, so that the point may assume the formof a fine wedge, not more than three fingers in length, a thingthat may be very easily effected by first steeping it in waterand then scraping it. The graft, however, must not be pointedwhile the wind is blowing, and care must be taken that thebark is not rubbed off from either graft or stock. The graftmust be thrust into the stock up to the point where the barkbegins; care, too, must be taken not to wrench off the barkduring the process of insertion, nor must it be thrust back soas to form any folds or wrinkles. It is for this reason that agraft should not be used that is too full of sap, no, by Hercules!no more than one that is dry and parched; for by doing so, inthe former case, from the excess of moisture, the bark becomesdetached, and in the latter, from want of vitality, it yieldsno secretions, and consequently will not incorporate with thestock.</p><p>It is a point most religiously<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> observed, to insert the graftduring the moon's increase, and to be careful to push it downwith both hands; indeed, it is really the fact, that in this operation, the two hands, acting at the same moment, are of necessity productive of a more modified and better regulated effort.Grafts that have been inserted with a vigorous effort are laterin bearing, but last all the longer; when inserted more ten-derly, the contrary is the result. The incision in the stockshould not be too open or too large; nor ought it to be toosmall, for in such case it would either force out the graft orelse kill it by compression. But the most necessary precautionof all is to see that the graft is fairly inserted, and that itoccupies exactly the middle of the fissure in the stock.</p><p>Some<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> persons are in the habit of making the place for thefissure in the stock with the knife, keeping the edges of theincision together with bands of osier bound tightly roundthe stock; they then drive in the wedges, the bands keeping the stock from opening too wide. There are some trees<pb n="3481" />that are grafted in the seed-plot and then transplanted thevery same day. If the stock used for grafting is of very considerable thickness, it is the best plan to insert the graft between the bark and the wood; for which purpose a wedgemade of bone is best, for fear lest when the bark is loosenedthe wood should be bruised. In the cherry, the bark is removedbefore the incision in the stock is made; this, too, is the onlytree that is grafted after the winter solstice. When the barkis removed, this tree presents a sort of downy substance, which,if it happens to adhere to the graft, will very speedily destroyit. When once the graft is safely lodged by the aid of thewedge, it is of advantage to drive it home. It is an excellentplan, too, to graft as near the ground as possible, if the conformation of the trunk land knots will admit of it. The graftshould not project from the stock more than six fingers inlength.</p><p>Cato<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> recommends a mixture of argil<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> or powdered chalk,and cow-dung, to be stirred together till it is of a viscous consistency, and then inserted in the fissure and rubbed all roundit. From his writings on the subject it is very evident thatat that period it was the practice to engraft only between thewood and the bark, and in no other way; and that the graftwas never inserted beyond a couple of fingers in depth.<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> Herecommends, too, that the pear and the apple should be graftedin spring, as also during fifty days at the time of the summersolstice, and during the time of vintage; but that the oliveand the fig should be grafted in spring only, in a thirsting, orin other words, a dry moon: he says also, that it should bedone in the afternoon, and not while a south wind is blowing.It is a singular thing, that, not content with protecting thegraft in the manner already mentioned, and with shelteringit from showers and frosts by means of turfs and supple bandsof split osiers, he recommends that it should be covered withbugloss<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> as well—a kind of herb so called—which is to betied over it and then covered up with straw. At the presentday, however, it is thought sufficient to cover the bark with a<pb n="3482" />mixture of mud and chaff, allowing the graft to protrude acouple of fingers in length.</p><p>Those who wait for spring to carry on these operations, willfind themselves pressed for time; for the buds are then justbursting, except, indeed, in the case of the olive, the buds ofwhich are remarkably long in developing themselves, the treeitself having extremely little sap beneath the bark; this,too, is apt, when in too large quantities, to injure the grafts.As to the pomegranate, too, the fig, and the rest of the treesthat are of a dry nature, it is far from beneficial to them toput off the process of grafting till a late period. The pearmay be grafted even when in blossom, so that with it theoperation may be safely delayed to the month of May even.If grafts of fruit trees have to be carried to any distance, itis considered the best plan, with the view of preserving thejuices, to insert them in a turnip; they may also be kept aliveby placing them near a stream or a pond, between two hollowtiles covered up at each end with earth. (15.) The grafts ofvines, however, are kept in dry holes, in which they arecovered over with straw, and then with earth, care being takento let the tops protrude.<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This story is borrowed from Theophrastus, De Caus.
