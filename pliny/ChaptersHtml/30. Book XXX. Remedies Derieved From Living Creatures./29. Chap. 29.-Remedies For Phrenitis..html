<div2 type="chapter" n="29" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 29.â€”REMEDIES FOR PHRENITIS.</head><p>In cases of phrenitis a sheep's lights, attached warm roundthe patient's head, would appear to be advantageous. But asto giving a man suffering from delirium a mouse's brains in<pb n="5453" />water to drink, the ashes of a burnt weasel, or the dried flesheven of a hedgehog, who could possibly do it, supposing eventhe effects of the remedy were certain? I should be inclined,too, to rank the ashes of the eyes of a horned owl in the number of those monstrous prescriptions with which the adepts inthe magic art abuse the credulity of mankind.</p><p>It is in cases, too, of fever, more particularly, that the acknowledged rules of medicine run counter to the prescriptionsof these men: for they have classified the various modes oftreating the disease in accordance with the twelve signs of theZodiac, and relatively to the revolutions of the sun and moon,a system which deserves to be utterly repudiated, as I shallprove by a few instances selected from many. They recommend, for example, when the sun is passing through Gemini,that the patient should be rubbed with ashes of the burntcombs, ears, and claws of cocks, beaten up and mixed withoil. If, again, it is the moon that is passing through thatsign, it is the spurs and wattles of cocks that must be similarly employed. When either of these luminaries is passingthrough Virgo, grains of barley must be used; and whenthrough Sagittarius, a bat's wings. When the moon is passing through Leo, it is leaves of tamarisk that must be employed,and of the cultivated tamarisk, they add: if, again, the signis Aquarius, the patient must use an application of box-woodcharcoal, pounded.</p><p>Of the remedies, however, that we find recommended bythem, I shall be careful to insert those only the efficacyof which has been admitted, or, at least, is probable in anydegree; such, for instance, as the use of powerful odours, asan excitant for patients suffering from lethargy; among which,perhaps, may be reckoned the dried testes of a weasel, or theliver of that animal, burnt. They consider it a good plan,too, to attach a sheep's lights, made warm, round the head ofthe patient.</p></div2></body>
