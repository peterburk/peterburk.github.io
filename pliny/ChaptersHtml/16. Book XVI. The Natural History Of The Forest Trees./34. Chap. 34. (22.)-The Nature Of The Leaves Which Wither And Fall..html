<div2 type="chapter" n="34" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 34. (22.)—THE NATURE OF THE LEAVES WHICH WITHERAND FALL.</head><p>All the trees, with the exception of those already men-<pb n="3375" />tioned—a list which it would be tedious to enumerate-losetheir leaves, and it has been observed that the leaf does notdry up and wither unless it is thin, broad, and soft; while,on the other hand, the leaves that do not fall are those whichare fleshy, thick, and narrow.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> It is an erroneous theorythat the leaf does not fall in those trees the juices of whichare more unctuous than the rest; for who could make out thatsuch is the case with the holm-oak, for instance? Timæus,the mathematician, is of opinion that the leaves fall while thesun is passing through the sign of Scorpio, being acted upon bythe influences of that luminary, and a certain venom whichexists in the atmosphere: but then we have a right to wonderhow it is that, the same reasons existing, the same influenceis not exercised equally on all.</p><p>The leaves of most trees fall in autumn, but in some at alater period, remaining on the tree till the approach of winter,it making no difference whether they have germinated at anearlier period or a later, seeing that some that are the veryfirst to bud are among the last to lose their leaves—thealmond, the ash, and the elder, for instance: the mulberry,on the other hand, buds the last of all, and loses its leavesamong the very first. The soil, too, exercises a very considerable influence in this respect: the leaves falling soonerwhere it is dry and thin, and more particularly when the treeis old: indeed, there are many trees that lose them before thefruit is ripe, as in the case of the late fig, for instance, and thewinter pear: on the pomegranate, too, the fruit, when ripe,beholds nothing but the trunk of the parent tree. And noteven upon those trees which always retain their foliage do thesame leaves always remain, for as others shoot up beneath them,the old leaves gradually wither away: this takes place aboutthe solstices more particularly.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This last assertion, Fée says, is far from true, in relation to the coni-ferous trees.</p></body>
