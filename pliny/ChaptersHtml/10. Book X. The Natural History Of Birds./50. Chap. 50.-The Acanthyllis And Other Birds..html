The bird, also, that is known as the acanthyllis,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> makes its nest of a similar shape, and interweaves itwith pieces of flax. The nest of one of the woodpeckers, verymuch like a cup in shape, is suspended by a twig from the endof the branch of a tree, so that no quadruped may be able toreach it. It is strongly asserted, that the witwall<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> sleepssuspended by its feet, because it fancies that by doing so it isin greater safety. A thing, indeed, that is well-known of themall, is the fact that, in a spirit of foresight, they select the projecting branches of trees that are sufficiently strong, for thepurpose of supporting their nests, and then arch them over toprotect them from the rain, or else shield them by means of thethickness of the foliage.</p><p>In Arabia there is a bird known as the "cinnamolgus."<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>It builds its nest with sprigs of cinnamon; and the nativesknock them down with arrows loaded with lead, in order tosell them. In Scythia there is a bird, the size of the otis,which produces two young ones always, in a hare's skin suspended<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> from the top branches of a tree. Pies, when theyhave observed a person steadily gazing at their nest, will immediately remove their eggs to another place. This is said tobe accomplished in a truly wonderful manner, by such birds ashave not toes adapted for holding and removing their eggs.They lay a twig upon two eggs, and then solder them to it bymeans of a glutinous matter secreted from their body; afterwhich, they pass their neck between the eggs, and so formingan equipoise, convey them to another place.<pb n="2516" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier thinks that this is either the <hi rend="ital">remiz,</hi> the Parus pendulinus ofLinnæus, or else the moustache, the Parus biarmicus of Linnæus.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Not moss, Cuvier says, but blades of grass, and the silken fibres of thepoplar and other aquatic trees.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier thinks that it is the same bird as the vitiparra of Pliny.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Galulus.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This story, in all its extravagance, is related first by Herodotus, andthen by Aristotle, who has reduced it to its present dimensions, as given byPliny.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier suggests that, if at all based upon truth, this may have beenthe case in one instance, and then ascribed to the whole species.</p></body>
