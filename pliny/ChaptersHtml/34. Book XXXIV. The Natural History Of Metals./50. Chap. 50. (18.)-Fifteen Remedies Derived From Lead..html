<div2 type="chapter" n="50" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 50. (18.)—FIFTEEN REMEDIES DERIVED FROM LEAD.</head><p>Lead is used in medicine, without any addition, for theremoval of scars; if it is applied, too, in plates, to the region ofthe loins and kidneys, in consequence of its cold nature it willrestrain the venereal passions, and put an end to libidinousdreams at night, attended with spontaneous emissions, and assumingall the form of a disease. The orator Calvus, it is said,effected a cure for himself by means of these plates, and so preservedhis bodily energies for labour and study. The EmperorNero—for so the gods willed it—could never sing to the fullpitch of his voice, unless he had a plate of lead upon his chest;thus showing us one method of preserving the voice.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> Formedicinal purposes the lead is melted in earthen vessels; a layerof finely powdered sulphur being placed beneath, very thinplates of lead are laid upon it, and are then covered with amixture of sulphur and iron. While it is being melted, allthe apertures in the vessel should be closed, otherwise a<pb n="6217" />noxious vapour is discharged from the furnace, of a deadlynature, to dogs in particular. Indeed, the vapours from allmetals destroy flies and gnats; and hence it is that in minesthere are none of those annoyances.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> Some persons, during theprocess, mix lead-filings with the sulphur, while others substituteceruse for sulphur. By washing, a preparation is madefrom lead, that is much employed in medicine: for this purpose,a leaden mortar, containing rain water, is beaten with apestle of lead, until the water has assumed a thick consistency;which done, the water that floats on the surface is removedwith a sponge, and the thicker part of the sediment is left todry, and is then divided into tablets. Some persons trituratelead-filings in this way, and some mix with it lead ore, orelse vinegar, wine, grease, or rose-leaves. Others, again,prefer triturating the lead in a stone mortar, one of Thebaicstone more particularly, with a pestle of lead; by whichprocess a whiter preparation is obtained.</p><p>As to calcined lead, it is washed, like stibi<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and cadmia.Its action is astringent and repressive, and it is promotive ofcicatrization. The same substance is also employed in preparations for the eyes, cases of procidence<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> of those organs moreparticularly; also for filling up the cavities left by ulcers, andfor removing excrescences and fissures of the anus, as well ashæmorrhoidal and condylomatous tumours. For all these purposesthe lotion of lead is particularly useful; but for serpiginousor sordid ulcers it is the ashes of calcined lead that areused, these producing the same advantageous effects as ashes ofburnt papyrus.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span></p><p>The lead is calcined in thin plates, laid with sulphur inshallow vessels, the mixture being stirred with iron rods orstalks of fennel-giant, until the melted metal becomes calcined;when cold, it is pulverized. Some persons calcine lead-filingsin a vessel of raw earth, which they leave in thefurnace, until the earthenware is completely baked. Others,again, mix with it an equal quantity of ceruse or of barley, andtriturate it in the way mentioned for raw lead; indeed, the<pb n="6218" />lead which has been prepared this way is preferred to thespodium of Cyprus.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This circumstance is mentioned by Suetonius, c. 20.—B.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hardouin observes, that these insects are never met with in mines;but probably this may depend more upon other causes, than upon thevapours which are supposed to proceed from the metals.—B.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxxiii. cc. 33, 34.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xx. c. 81, and B. xxiv. c. 73.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Charta."
