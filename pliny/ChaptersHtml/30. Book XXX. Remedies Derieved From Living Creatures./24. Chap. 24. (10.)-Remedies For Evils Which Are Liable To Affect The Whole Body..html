(10.)â€”REMEDIES FOR EVILS WHICH ARE LIABLE TOAFFECT THE WHOLE BODY.</head><p>We will now turn our attention to those evils which are a<pb n="5449" />cause of apprehension, as affecting the whole body. Accordingto what the magicians say, the gall of a male black dog is acounter-charm for the whole of a house; and it will be quite sufficient to make fumigations with it, or to use it as a purification,to ensure its preservation against all noxious drugs and preparations. They say the same, too, with reference to a dog'sblood, if the walls are sprinkled with it; and the genitals ofthat animal, if buried beneath the threshold. This will surprise persons the less who are aware how highly these samemagicians extol that most abominable insect, the tick, andall because it is the only one that has no<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> passage for theevacuations, its eating ending only in its death, and it living allthe longer for fasting: in this latter state it has been knownto live so long as seven days, they say, but when it gorges tosatiety it will burst in a much shorter period. According tothese authorities, a tick from a dog's left ear, worn as anamulet, will allay all kinds of pains. They presage, too, fromit on matters of life and death; for if the patient, they say,gives an answer to a person who has a tick about him, and,standing at the foot of the bed, asks how he is, it is an infallible sign that he will survive; while, on the other hand, if hemakes no answer, he will be sure to die. They add, also, thatthe dog from whose left ear the tick is taken, must be entirelyblack. Nigidius has stated in his writings that dogs willavoid the presence all day of a person who has taken a tickfrom off a hog.</p><p>The magicians likewise assure us that patients sufferingfrom delirium will recover their reason on being sprinkledwith a mole's blood; and that persons who are apt to betroubled by the gods of the night<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and by Fauni, will experience relief by rubbing themselves morning and evening withthe tongue, eyes, gall, and intestines of a dragon,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> boiled inoil, and cooled in the open air at night.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A popular fallacy of Pliny's time.
