One of these is called, by the ®thiopians, thenabun.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> It has a neck like that of the horse, feet and legslike those of the ox, a head like that of the camel, and iscovered with white spots upon a red ground; from which peculiarities it has been called the cameleopard.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> It was firstseen at Rome in the Circensian games held by C¾sar, theDictator.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> Since that time too, it has been occasionally seen.It is more remarkable for the singularity of its appearancethan for its fierceness; for which reason it has obtained thename of the wild sheep.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He speaks here of only <hi rend="ital">one</hi> of the animals which resemble the camel;the giraffe, namely. The other, which he for the present omits, is theostrich.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The description of the giraffe, here given, is sufficiently correct, butwe have a more minute account of it by Dion Cassius, B. xliii. In thetime of the Emperor Gordian, ten of these animals were exhibited atRome at once; a remarkable fact, when we bear in mind that so few havebeen imported into Europe for many centuries past. The giraffe isfigured in the mosaic at Pr¾neste, and under it is inscribed its name,nabi.ÑB. It has been found that it is unable to bear the winters ofEurope.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Its form being like that of the camel, while its spots resemble thoseof the leopard. Horace refers to it, when speaking of an object calculatedto excite the vulgar gaze; "Diversum confusa genus panthera camelo"Ñ"The race of the panther mingled with the camel," Ep. B. ii.; Ep. i.1. 195.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">According to Dion Cassius, B. xliii., these games were celebratedA.U.C. 708.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This comparison can only be employed to indicate the mild nature ofthe giraffe.ÑB.</p></body>
