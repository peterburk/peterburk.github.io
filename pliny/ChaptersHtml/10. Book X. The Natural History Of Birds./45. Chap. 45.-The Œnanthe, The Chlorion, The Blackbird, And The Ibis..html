At the rising of Sirius it conceals itself, and at thesetting of that star comes forth from its retreat: and this itdoes, a most singular thing, exactly upon both those days.The chlorion,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> also, the body of which is yellow all over, isnot seen in the winter, but comes out about the summer solstice.</p><p>(30.) The blackbird is found in the vicinity of Cyllene, inArcadia, with white<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> plumage; a thing that is the case nowhere else. The ibis, in the neighbourhood of Pelusium<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> onlyis black, while in all other places it is white.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It has not been identified with precision. Pliny, B. xviii. c. 69 callsit a small bird. Some make it the popinjay; others, with more probability, the lapwing. Horace, B. iii. Ode 27, mentions it as the parra, abird of ill omen.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Oriolus luteus, or witwall, according to Linn¾us.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">White blackbirds (if we may employ the paradox) are a distinctvariety, according to Cuvier, to be found in various countries, though butrarely.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is from Herodotus, but it is incorrect. The black, or rathergreen ibis, Cuvier says, the Scolopax falcinellus of Linn¾us, is found notonly near Pelusium, but all over the south of Europe.</p></body>
