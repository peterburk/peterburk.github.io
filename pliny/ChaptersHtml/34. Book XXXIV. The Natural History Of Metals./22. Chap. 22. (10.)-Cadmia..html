(10.)ÑCADMIA.</head><p>The ores of copper furnish a number of resources<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> that areemployed in medicine; indeed, all kinds of ulcers are healedthereby with great rapidity. Of these, however, the mostuseful is cadmia.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> This substance is formed artificially,<pb n="6192" />beyond a doubt, in the furnaces, also, where they smelt silver,but it is whiter and not so heavy, and by no means to be comparedwith that from copper. There are several kinds of it. For,as the mineral itself, from which it is prepared artificially, sonecessary in fusing copper ore, and so useful in medicine, hasthe name of "cadmia,"<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> so also is it found in the smelting-furnaces,where it receives other names, according to the way inwhich it is formed. By the action of the flame and the blast,the more attenuated parts of the metal are separated, andbecome attached, in proportion to their lightness, to thearched top and sides of the furnace. These flakes are thethinnest near the exterior opening of the furnace, where theflame finds a vent, the substance being called "capnitis;"<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>from its burnt appearance and its extreme lightness it resembleswhite ashes. The best is that which is found in theinterior, hanging from the arches of the chimney, and from itsform and position named "botryitis."<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> It is heavier than thefirst-mentioned kind, but lighter than those which follow. Itis of two different colours: the least valuable is ash-coloured,the better kind being red, friable, and extremely useful as aremedy for affections of the eyes.</p><p>A third kind of cadmia is that found on the sides of thefurnace, and which, in consequence of its weight, could notreach the arched vaults of the chimney. This species iscalled "placitis,"<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> in reference to its solid appearance, it presentinga plane surface more like a solid crust than pumice,and mottled within. Its great use is, for the cure of itch-scab,and for making wounds cicatrize. Of this last thereare two varieties, the "onychitis," which is almost entirelyblue on the exterior, and spotted like an onyx within;and the "ostracitis,"<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> which is quite black and more dirtythan the others, but particularly useful for healing wounds.All the species of cadmia are of the best quality from thefurnaces of Cyprus. When used in medicine it is heated a<pb n="6193" />second time upon a fire of pure charcoal, and when dulyincinerated, is quenched in Aminean<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> wine, if required formaking plasters, but in vinegar, if wanted for the cure of itch-scab.Some persons first pound it, and then burn it inearthen pots; which done, they wash it in mortars and thendry it.</p><p>Nymphodorus<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> recommends that the most heavy and densepieces of mineral cadmia that can be procured, should beburnt upon hot coals and quenched in Chian wine; afterwhich, it must be pounded and then sifted through a linencloth. It is then pulverized in a mortar and macerated inrain water, the sediment being again pounded until it isreduced to the consistency of ceruse, and presents no grittinessto the teeth. Iollas<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> recommends the same process;except that he selects the purest specimens of native cadmia.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Most of these preparations are in reality highly dangerous. Oxides,however, or salts of copper, have been employed internally with success,acting by alvine evacuation and by vomiting. The <hi rend="ital">Crocus Veneris</hi> of theold chemists was an oxide of copper. It is still used by the peasants ofSilesia, Ajasson says.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is obvious that the "cadmia" here described must be an essentiallydifferent substance from the "cadmia" mentioned in the secondChapter of this Book, that being a natural production, possibly calamineor hydrosilicate or carbonate of zinc; while the "cadmia" of this Chapteris a furnace-calamine, a product of the fusion of the ore of copper, orzinc.ÑB. It is evident, too, that copper ores, impregnated with zinc or calamine,also passed under this name. See Beckmann, Hist. Inv. Vol. II.pp. 33Ð35, <hi rend="ital">Bohn's Edition,</hi> where this subject is discussed at considerablelength: also the treatise by Delafosse, in Lemaire's Edition of Pliny.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The metal known to us as "cadmium" was discovered by ProfessorStromeyer in <date value="1818" authname="1818">1818</date>: it is either associated in its ores with zinc, or forms anative sulphuret.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Smoky residue."
