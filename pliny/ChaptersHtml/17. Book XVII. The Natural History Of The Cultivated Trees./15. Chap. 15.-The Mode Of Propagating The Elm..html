It is then left to dry two days in theshade, after which it is thickly sown in a broken soil, earththat has been riddled through a fine sieve being thrown uponit, to the same thickness as in the case of the cypress.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> Itthere should happen to be no rain, it is necessary to water theseed. From the nursery the young plants are carried at theend of a year to the elm-plots, where they are planted at intervals of a foot each way. It is better to plant elms in autumnthat are to support the vine, as they are destitute<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> of seedand are only propagated from plants. In the vicinity of theCity, the young elms are transplanted into the vineyard atfive years old, or, according to the plan adopted by some, whenthey are twenty feet in height. A furrow is first drawn for<pb n="3468" />the purpose, the name given to which is "novenarius,"<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> beingthree feet in depth, and the same in breadth or even more;into this the young tree is put, and the earth is moulded uparound it to the height of three feet every way. These moundsare known by the name of "arula"<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> in Campania. Theintervals are arranged according to the nature of the spot; butwhere the country is level, it is requisite that the trees shouldbe planted wider apart. Poplars and ashes, too, as they ger-minate with greater rapidity, ought to be planted out at anearlier period, or, in other words, immediately after the ides ofFebruary.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> In arranging trees and shrubs for the support ofthe vine, the form of the quincunx<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> is the one that is gene-rally adopted, and, indeed, is absolutely necessary: it not onlyfacilitates the action of the wind, but presents also a veryPleasing appearance, for whichever way you look at the plantation the trees will always present themselves in a straightLine. The same method is employed in propagating the poplarfrom seed as the elm, and the mode of transplanting it fromthe seed-plot is the same as that adopted in transplanting itfrom the forests.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">First of March.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The thickness of the thumb.
