<div2 type="chapter" n="48" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 48.ÑREMEDIES FOR DISEASES AND AFFECTIONS OFTHE EARS.</head><p>Pains and diseases of the ears are cured by using the urineof a wild boar, kept in a glass vessel, or the gall of a wildboar, swine, or ox, mixed with castor-oil and oil of roses inequal proportions. But the best remedy of all is bull's gall,warmed with leek juice, or with honey, if there is any suppuration. Bull's gall too, warmed by itself in a pomegranaterind, is an excellent remedy for offensive exhalations from theears: in combination with woman's milk, it is efficacious as acure for ruptures of those organs. Some persons are of opinionthat it is a good plan to wash the ears with this preparation incases where the hearing is affected; while others again, afterwashing the ears with warm water, insert a mixture composedof the old slough of a serpent and vinegar, wrapped up in adossil of wool. In cases, however, where the deafness is veryconsiderable, gall warmed in a pomegranate rind with myrrhand rue, is injected into the ears; sometimes, also, fat baconis used for this purpose, or fresh asses' dung, mixed with oilof roses: in all cases, however, the ingredients should bewarmed.</p><p>The foam from a horse's mouth is better still, or the ashesof fresh horse dung, mixed with oil of roses: fresh butter toois good; beef-suet mixed with goose-grease; the urine of abull or she-goat; or fullers' lant, heated to such a degree thatthe steam escapes by the neck of the vessel. For this purposealso, one third part of vinegar is mixed with a small portion ofthe urine of a calf, which has not begun to graze. They applyalso to the ears calf's dung, mixed with the gall of that animal<pb n="5338" />and sloughs of serpents, care being taken to warm the ears before the application, and all the remedies being wrapped inwool. Veal-suet, too, is used, with goose-grease and extract ofocimum; or else veal marrow, mixed with bruised cumminand injected into the ears. For pains in the ears, the liquidejected by a boar in copulation is used, due care being taken toreceive it before it falls to the ground. For fractures of theears, a glutinous composition is made from the genitals of acalf, which is dissolved in water when used; and for otherdiseases of those organs, foxes' fat is employed, goat's gallmixed with rose-oil warmed, or else extracted juice of leeks:in all cases where there is any rupture, these preparations areused in combination with woman's milk. Where a patient issuffering from hardness of hearing, ox-gall is employed, withthe urine of a he or she-goat; the same, too, where there isany suppuration.</p><p>Whatever the purpose for which they are wanted, it is thegeneral opinion that these substances are more efficacious whenthey have been smoked in a goat's horn for twenty days.Hare's rennet, too, is highly spoken of, taken in Aminean<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>wine, in the proportion of one third of a denarius of rennet toone half of a denarius of sacopenum.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> Bears' grease, mixedwith equal proportions of wax and bull-suet, is a cure forimposthumes of the parotid glands: some persons add hypocisthis<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> to the composition, or else content themselves withemploying butter only, after first fomenting the parts affectedwith a decoction of fenugreek, the good effects of which areaugmented by strychnos. The testes, too, of the fox, are veryuseful for this purpose; as also bull's blood, dried and reducedto powder. She-goats' urine, made warm, is used as an injection for the ears; and a liniment is made of the dung of thoseanimals, in combination with axle-grease.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xiv. c. 4.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xx. c. 75.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxvi. c. 31.</p></body>
