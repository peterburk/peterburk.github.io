<div2 type="chapter" n="9" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 9.—AUTHORS WHO HAVE WRITTEN ON FLOWERS. AN ANECDOTE RELATIVE TO QUEEN CLEOPATRA AND CHAPLETS.</head><p>Among the Greeks, the physicians Mnesitheus and Callimachus have written separate treatises on the subject ofchaplets, making mention of such flowers as are injurious tothe head.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> For, in fact, the health is here concerned to someextent, as it is at the moments of carousal and gaiety in particular that penetrating odours steal insidiously upon thebrain—witness an instance in the wicked cunning displayedupon one occasion by Cleopatra.</p><p>At the time when preparations were making for the battlethat was eventually fought at Actium, Antonius held thequeen in such extreme distrust as to be in dread of her veryattentions even, and would not so much as touch his food,unless another person had tasted it first. Upon this, thequeen, it is said, wishing to amuse herself with his fears, hadthe extremities of the flowers in a chaplet dipped in poison, andthen placed it upon her head.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> After a time, as the hilarityincreased apace, she challenged Antonius to swallow the chap-<pb n="4310" />lets, mixed up with their drink. Who, under such circumstancesas these, could have apprehended treachery? Accordingly,the leaves were stripped from off the chaplet, and thrown intothe cup. Just as Antonius was on the very point of drinking,she arrested his arm with her hand.—"Behold, Marcus Antonius," saidshe, "the woman against whom you are so careful to take these newprecautions of yours in employing yourtasters! And would then, if I could exist without you, eithermeans or opportunity of effecting my purpose be wanting tome?" Saying this, she ordered a man to be brought fromprison, and made him drink off the potion; he did so, andfell dead<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> upon the spot.</p><p>Besides the two authors above-mentioned, Theophrastus,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>among the Greeks, has written on the subject of flowers.Some of our own writers also have given the title of "Anthologica" to their works, but no one, to my knowledge at least,has treated expressly<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> of flowers. In fact, we ourselves haveno intention here of discussing the mode of wearing chaplets,for that would be frivolous<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> indeed; but shall proceed tostate such particulars in relation to flowers as shall appear tous deserving of remark.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is a well-known fact, as Fée remarks, that the smell of flowers isproductive, in some persons, of head-ache, nausea, and vertigo. He statesalso that persons have been known to meet their death from sleeping allnight in the midst of odoriferous flowers.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Ipsaque capiti imposita." Holland and Ajasson render this asthough Cleopatra placed the garland on Antony's head, and not her own.Littré agrees with the translation here adopted.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Fée remarks that we know of no poisons, hydrocyanic or prussic acidexcepted, so instantaneous in their effects as this; and that it is verydoubtful if they were acquainted with that poison.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hist. Plant. B. vi. cc. 6, 7.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Persecutus est."</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A characteristic, it would appear, of the greater part of theinformation already given in this Book.</p></body>
