If branches<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> ofthis plant are used, the bees may be kept within bounds without any difficulty. It is an excellent remedy, also, for thestings of bees, wasps, and similar insects, as also for woundsmade by spiders and scorpions; it is used, too, for hystericalsuffocations, in combination with nitre, and for gripings of thebowels, with wine. The leaves of it are employed topicallyfor scrofulous sores, and, in combination with salt, for maladiesof the fundament. A decoction of the juice promotes the menstrual discharge, dispels inflammations, and heals ulceroussores: it is good, too, for diseases of the joints and the bitesof dogs, and is beneficial in cases of inveterate dysentery, andfor cœliac affections, hardness of breathing, diseases of thespleen, and ulcerations of the thoracic organs. For films onthe eyes, it is considered a most excellent plan to anoint themwith the juice of this plant mixed with honey.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Sec B. xx. c. 45, and c. 41 of this Book.
