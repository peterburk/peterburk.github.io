<div2 type="chapter" n="32" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 32.ÑWHAT COLOURS WERE USED BY THE ANCIENTS INPAINTING.</head><p>It was with four colours only,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> that Apelles,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> Echion,Melanthius, and Nicomachus, those most illustrous painters,executed their immortal works; melinum<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> for the white, Atticsil<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> for the yellow, Pontic sinopis for the red, and atramentumfor the black;<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> and yet a single picture of theirs has sold beforenow for the treasures of whole cities. But at the present day,when purple is employed for colouring walls even, and whenIndia sends to us the slime<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> of her rivers, and the corrupt bloodof her dragons<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> and her elephants, there is no such thing as apicture of high quality produced. Everything, in fact, was superiorat a time when the resources of art were so much fewerthan they now are. Yes, so it is; and the reason is, as we<pb n="6246" />have already stated,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> that it is the material, and not the effortsof genius, that is now the object of research.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny here commits a mistake, which may have arisen from an imperfectrecollection, as Sir. H. Davy has supposed, of a passage in Cicero(Brutus, c. 18), which, however, quite contradicts the statement of Pliny."In painting, we admire in the works of Zeuxis, Polygnotus, Timanthes,and those who used <hi rend="ital">four</hi> colours only, the figure and the lineaments; butin the works of Echion, Nicomachus, Protogenes, and Apelles, <hi rend="ital">everything</hi>is perfect." Indeed Pliny contradicts himself, for he speaks of <hi rend="ital">two</hi> otherscolours used by the earliest painters, the <hi rend="ital">testa trita,</hi> or ground earthenware,in Chapter 5 of this Book; and "cinnabaris," or vermilion, in B. xxxiii.c. 36. Also, in Chapter 21 of this Book he speaks of Eretrian earth ashaving been used by Nicomachus, and in Chapter 25 of ivory black ashaving been invented by Apelles.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">These painters will all be noticed in Chapter 36.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See Chapter 19 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxxiii. c. 56.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Blue is here excluded altogether, unless under the term "atramentum"we would include black and blue indicum, or in other words, Indianink and indigo.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See Chapter 27 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In allusion to "Dragon's blood."
