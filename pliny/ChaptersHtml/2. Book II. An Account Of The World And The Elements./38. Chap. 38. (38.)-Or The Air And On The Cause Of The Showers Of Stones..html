<div2 type="chapter" n="38" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 38. (38.)—OR THE AIR AND ON THE CAUSE OF THESHOWERS OF STONES.</head><p>So far I have spoken of the world itself and of the stars.I must now give an account of the other remarkable phænomena of theheavens. For our ancestors have given thename of heavens, or, sometimes, another name, air, to all theseemingly void space, which diffuses around us this vitalspirit. It is situated beneath the moon, indeed much lower,as is admitted by every one who has made observations onit, and is composed of a great quantity of air from the upperregions, mixed with a great quantity of terrestrial vapour, thetwo forming a compound. Hence proceed clouds, thunderand lightning of all kinds; hence also hail, frost, showers,storms and whirlwinds; hence proceed many of the evilsincident to mortals, and the mutual contests of the variousparts of nature. The force of the stars keeps down all terrestrialthings which tend towards the heavens, and the sameforce attracts to itself those things which do not go therespontaneously. The showers fall, mists rise up, rivers aredried up, hail-storms rush down, the rays of the sun parchthe earth, and impel it from all quarters towards the centre.The same rays, still unbroken, dart back again, and carrywith them whatever they can take up. Vapour falls fromon high and returns again to the same place. Winds arisewhich contain nothing, but which return loaded with spoils.The breathing of so many animals draws down the spirit fromthe higher regions; but this tends to go in a contrary direction, andthe earth pours out its spirit into the void spaceof the heavens. Thus nature moving to and fro, as if impelled by somemachine<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>, discord is kindled by the rapidmotion of the world. Nor is the contest allowed to cease,for she is continually whirled round and lays open the causesof all things, forming an immense globe about the earth,while she again, from time to time, covers this other firma-<pb n="1066" />ment with clouds<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>. This is the region of the winds. Heretheir nature principally originates, as well as the causes ofalmost all other things<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>; since most persons ascribe thedarting of thunder and lightning to their violence. And tothe same cause are assigned the showers of stones, thesehaving been previously taken up by the wind, as well asmany other bodies in the same way. On this account wemust enter more at large on this subject.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Ut circumagendo balistæ vel fundæ impetus augetur."
