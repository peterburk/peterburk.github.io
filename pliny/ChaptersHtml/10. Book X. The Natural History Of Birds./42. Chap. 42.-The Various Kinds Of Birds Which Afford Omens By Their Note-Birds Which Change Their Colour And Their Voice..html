From black, the blackbird changes to a reddish colour, sings in summer, chatters in winter, and aboutthe summer solstice loses its voice; when a year old, the beakalso assumes the appearance of ivory; this, however, is the caseonly with the male. In the summer, the thrush is mottledabout the neck, but in the winter it becomes of one uniformcolour all over.</p></div2></body>
