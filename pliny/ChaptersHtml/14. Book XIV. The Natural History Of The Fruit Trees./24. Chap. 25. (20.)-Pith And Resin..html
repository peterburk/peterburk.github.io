<div2 type="chapter" n="25" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 25. (20.)—PITH AND RESIN.</head><p>Of the trees from which pitch and resin distil, there aresome which grow in the East, and others in Europe: the province of Asia,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> which lies between the two, has also some ofboth kinds. In the East, the very best commodity of thiskind, and of the finest quality, is that produced by the terebinth,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and, next to it, that from the lentisk,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> which is alsoknown as the mastich. The next in quality to these is the juiceof the cypress,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> being of a more acrid flavour than any other.<pb n="3265" />All the above juices are liquid and of a resinous nature only,but that of the cedar<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> is comparatively thick, and of a properconsistency for making pitch. The Arabian resin<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> is of apale colour, has an acrid smell, and its fumes are stifling tothose employed in boiling it. That of Judæa is of a hardernature, and has a stronger smell than that from the terebinth<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>even. The Syrian<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> resin has all the appearance of Attichoney, but that of Cyprus is superior to any other; it is thecolour of honey, and is of a soft, fleshy nature. The resin ofColophon<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> is yellower than the other varieties, but whenpounded it turns white; it has a stifling smell, for whichreason the perfumers do not employ it. That prepared inAsia from the produce of the pitch-tree is very white, and isknown by the name of "spagas."</p><p>All the resins are soluble in oil;<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> some persons are of opinion also that potters' chalk may be so dissolved:<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> I feelashamed<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> to avow that the principal esteem in which theresins are held among us is as depilatories for taking the hairoff men's bodies.</p><p>The method used for seasoning wines is to sprinkle pitchin the must during the first fermentation, which never lastsbeyond nine days at the most, so that a bouquet is impartedto the wine,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> with, in some degree, its own peculiar piquancyof flavour. It is generally considered, that this is done mosteffectually by the use of raw flower<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> of resin, which impartsa considerable degree of briskness to wine: while, on theother hand, it is thought that crapula<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> itself, if mixed, tends<pb n="3266" />to mitigate the harshness of the wine and subdue its asperity,and when the wine is thin and flat, to give it additionalstrength and body. It is in Liguria more particularly, andthe districts in the vicinity of the Padus, that the utility isrecognized of mixing crapula with the must, in doing whichthe following rule is adopted: with wines of a strong andgenerous nature they mix a larger quantity, while with thosethat are poor and thin they use it more sparingly. There aresome who would have the wine seasoned with both crapulaand flower of resin at the same time.<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> Pitch too, when usedfor this purpose, has much the same properties as must whenso employed.</p><p>In some places, the must is subject to a spontaneous fermentation a second time: when this unfortunately happens it losesall its flavour, and then receives the name of "vappa,"<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> a wordwhich is applied as an opprobrious appellation even to worthless men of degenerate spirit: in vinegar, on the other hand,notwithstanding its tart and acrid taste, there are very considerable virtues, and without it we should miss many of thecomforts<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> of civilized life.</p><p>In addition to what we have already stated, the treatmentand preparation of wines are the object of such remarkable attention, that we find some persons employing ashes, and othersgypsum and other substances of which we have already<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span>spoken, for the purpose of improving its condition: the ashes,<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span>however, of the shoots of vines or of the wood of the quercus, arein general preferred for this purpose. It is recommended also,<pb n="3267" />to take sea-water far out at sea, and to keep it in reserve,<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span>to be employed for this purpose: at all events, it ought to betaken up in the night and during the summer solstice, whilethe north-east wind is blowing; but if taken at the time ofthe vintage, it should be boiled before being used.</p><p>The pitch most highly esteemed in Italy for preparingvessels for storing wine, is that which comes from Bruttium.It is made from the resin that distils from the pitch-tree; thatwhich is used in Spain is held in but little esteem, being theproduce of the wild pine; it is bitter, dry, and of a disagreeable smell. While speaking of the wild trees in a succeedingBook,<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> we shall make mention of the different varieties of pitch,and the methods used in preparing it. The defects in resin,besides those which<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span> we have already mentioned, are a certaindegree of acridity, or a peculiar smoky flavour, while the greatfault in pitch is the being over-burnt. The ordinary testof its goodness is a certain luminous appearance when brokento pieces; it ought to stick, too, to the teeth, with a pleasant,tart flavour.</p><p>In Asia, the pitch which is most esteemed is that of MountIda, in Greece of Pieria; but Virgil<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span> gives the preference tothe Narycian<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span> pitch. The more careful makers mix withthe wine black mastich, which comes from Pontus,<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span> and resembles bitumen in appearance, as also iris<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span>-root and oil. As tocoating the vessels with wax, it has been found that the wineis apt to turn acid:<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span> it is a better plan to put wine in vesselsthat have held vinegar, than in those which have previouslycontained sweet wine or mulsum. Cato<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span> recommends thatwines should be got <hi rend="ital">up—concinnari</hi> is his word—by puttingof lie-ashes boiled down with defrutum, one-fortieth part to theculeus, or else a pound and a half of salt, with poundedmarble as well: he makes mention of sulphur also, but only givesthe very last place to resin. When the fermentation of the wineis coming to an end, he recommends the addition of the must<pb n="3268" />to which he gives the name of "tortivum,"<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span> meaning thatwhich is pressed out the very last of all. For the purpose ofcolouring wine we also add certain substances as a sort of pigment, and these have a tendency to give it a body as well.By such poisonous sophistications is this beverage compelledto suit our tastes, and then we are surprised that it is inju-rious in its effects!</p><p>It is a proof that wine is beginning to turn bad, if a plate oflead, on being put in it, changes its colour.<span id="ref_31"><a href="#note_31">[31]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Asia Minor, namely.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">B. xiii. c. 12.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">B. xii. c. 37.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It produces but a very minute quantity of resin, which is no longeran article of commerce.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xiii. c. 11, and B. xvi. c. 21.
