<div2 type="chapter" n="6" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 6. (6.)—LIBYA MAREOTIS.</head><p>The region that follows is called Libya Mareotis<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>, andborders upon Egypt. It is held by the Marmaridæ, theAdyrmachidæ, and, after them, the Mareotœ. The distancefrom Catabathmos to Parætonium is eighty-six<pb n="1402" />miles. In this district is Apis<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>, a place rendered famous bythe religious belief of Egypt. From this town Parætoniumis distant sixty-two miles, and from thence to Alexandriathe distance is 200 miles, the breadth of the district being169. Eratosthenes says that it is 525 miles by land fromCyrene to Alexandria; while Agrippa gives the length ofthe whole of Africa from the Atlantic Sea, and includingLower Egypt, as 3040 miles. Polybius and Eratosthenes,who are generally considered as remarkable for their extremecorrectness, state the length to be, from the ocean to GreatCarthage 1100 miles, and from Carthage to Canopus, thenearest mouth of the Nile, 1628 miles; while Isidorus speaksof the distance from Tingi to Canopus as being 3599 miles.Artemidorus makes this last distance forty miles less thanIsidorus.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Mareotis of the time of the Ptolemies extended from Alexandria to the Gulf of Plinthinethes; and Libya was properly that portion of territory which extended from that Gulf to Catabathmos. Pliny is in error here in confounding the two appellations, or rather, blending them into one. It includes the eastern portion of the modern Barca, and the western division of Lower Egypt. It most probably received its name from the Lake Mareotis, and not the lake from it.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This was a seaport town on the northern coast of Africa, probably about eleven or twelve miles west of Parætonium, sometimes spoken of as belonging to Egypt, sometimes to Marmorica. Scylax places it at the western boundary of Egypt, on the frontier of the Marmaridæ. Ptolemy, like Pliny, speaks of it as being in the Libyan Nomos. The distances given in the MSS. of Pliny of this place from Parætonium are seventy-two, sixty-two, and twelve miles; the latter is probably the correct reading, as Strabc, B. xvii., makes the distance 100 stadia. It is extremely doubtful whether the Apis mentioned by Herodotus, B. ii. c. 18, can be the same place: but there is little doubt, from the words of Pliny here, that it was dedicated to the worship of the Egyptian god Apis, who was represented under the form of a bull.</p></body>
