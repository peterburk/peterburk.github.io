It carries off bile, and acts strongly as a purgativeupon the bowels; unless, indeed, aloes are added, in the proportion of two drachm¾ of aloes to two oboli of scammony. Thedrug thus called is the juice of a plant that is branchy fromthe root, and has unctuous, white, triangular, leaves, witha solid, moist root, of a nauseous flavour: it grows in richwhite soils. About the period of the rising of the Dogstar, an excavation is made about the root, to let the juicecollect: which done. it is dried in the sun and divided intotablets. The root itself, too, or the outer coat of it, is sometimes dried. The scammony most esteemed is that of Colophon,Mysia, and Priene. In appearance it ought to he smooth andshiny, and as much like bull glue as possible: it should presenta fungous surface also, covered with minute holes; should meltwith the greatest rapidity, have a powerful smell, and be stickylike gum. When touched with the tongue, it should give outa white milky liquid; it ought also to be extremely light, andto turn white when melted.<pb n="5177" /></p><p>This last feature is recognized in the spurious scammonyalso, a compound of meal of fitches and juice of marine tithy-malos,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> which is mostly imported from Judea, and is very aptto choke those who use it. The difference may be easilydetected, however, by the taste, as tithymalos imparts a burning sensation to the tongue. To be fully efficacious, scammonyshould be two<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> years old; before or after that age it is useless.It has been prescribed to be taken by itself also, in doses offour oboli, with hydromel and salt: but the most advantageousmode of using it is in combination with aloes, care being takento drink honied wine the moment it begins to operate. Theroot, too, is boiled down in vinegar to the consistency of honey,and the decoction used as a liniment for leprosy. The head isalso rubbed with this decoction, mixed with oil, for head-ache.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The produce of the Convolvulus scammonia of Linn¾us, the Scam-mony bind-weed.
