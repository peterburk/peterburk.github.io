THE DISH OF®SOPUS.</head><p>The first person who invented aviaries for the reception ofall kinds of birds was M. L¾nius Strabo, a member of theequestrian order, who resided at Brundisium. It was in histime that we thus began to imprison animals to which Naturehad assigned the heavens as their element.</p><p>(51.) But more remarkable than anything in this respect, is<pb n="2532" />the story of the dish of Clodius ®sopus,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> the tragic actor,which was valued at one hundred thousand sesterces, and inwhich were served up nothing but birds that had been remarkable for their song, or their imitation of the human voice, andpurchased, each of them, at the price of six thousand sesterces;he being induced to this folly by no other pleasure than thatin these he might eat the closest imitators of man; never fora moment reflecting that his own immense fortune had beenacquired by the advantages of his voice; a parent, indeed,right worthy of the son of whom we have already made mention,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> as swallowing pearls. It would not, to say the truth,be very easy to come to a conclusion which of the two wasguilty of the greatest baseness; unless, indeed, we are ready toadmit that it was less unseemly to banquet upon the mostcostly of all the productions of Nature, than to devour<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> tongueswhich had given utterance to the language of man.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Valerius Maximus, B. ix. c. 1, tells this story of the profligate son of®sopus.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">B. ix. c. 59.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Hominum linguas," Pliny says; a singularly inappropriate expression, it would appear.</p></body>
