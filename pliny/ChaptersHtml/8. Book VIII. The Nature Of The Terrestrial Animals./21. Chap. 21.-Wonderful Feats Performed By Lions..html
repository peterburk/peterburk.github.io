In the reign, however, of the Emperor Claudius, accident disclosed a methodwhich appears almost disgraceful to the name of such ananimal; a Gætulian shepherd stopped a lion, that was rushingfuriously upon him, by merely throwing his cloak<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> over theanimal; a circumstance which afterwards afforded an exhibitionin the arena of the Circus, when the frantic fury of the animalwas paralyzed in a manner almost incredible by a light coveringbeing thrown over its head, so much so, that it was put intochains without the least resistance; we must conclude, therefore,that all its strength lies in its eyes. This circumstance renderswhat was done by Lysimachus<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> less wonderful, who strangleda lion, with which he had been shut up by command of Alexander.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span></p><p>Antony subjected lions to the yoke, and was the first atRome to harness them to his chariot;<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and this during thecivil war, after the battle on the plains of Pharsalia; not,indeed, without a kind of ominous presage, a prodigy thatforetold at the time how that generous spirits were about to besubdued. But to have himself drawn along in this manner, in company with the actress Cytheris,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> was a thing that<pb n="2271" />surpassed even the most monstrous spectacles that were to beseen at that calamitous period. It is said that Hanno, one ofthe most illustrious of the Carthaginians, was the first whoventured to touch the lion with the hand, and to exhibit it ina tame state. It was on this account that he was banished;for it was supposed, that a man so talented and so ingeniouswould have it in his power to persuade the people to anything,and it was looked upon as unsafe to trust the liberties of thecountry to one who had so eminently triumphed over evenferocity itself. There are some fortuitous occurrences citedalso, which have given occasion to these animals to displaytheir natural clemency. Mentor, a native of Syracuse, wasmet in Syria by a lion, who rolled before him in a suppliantmanner; though smitten with fear and desirous to escape, thewild beast on every side opposed his flight, and licked his feetwith a fawning air. Upon this, Mentor observed on the pawof the lion a swelling and a wound; from which, after extractinga splinter, he relieved the creature's pain.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> There is a pictureat Syracuse, which bears witness to the truth of this transaction.</p><p>In the same manner, too, Elpis, a native of Samos, on landingfrom a vessel on the coast of Africa, observed a lion near thebeach, opening his mouth in a threatening manner; upon whichhe climbed a tree, in the hope of escaping, while, at the sametime, he invoked the aid of Father Liber; for it is the appropriate time for invocations when there is no room left for hope.The wild beast did not pursue him as he fled, although he mighteasily have done so; but, lying down at the foot of the tree,by the open mouth which had caused so much terror, tried toexcite his compassion. A bone, while he was devouring hisfood with too great avidity, had stuck fast between his teeth,and he was perishing with hunger; such being the punishmentinflicted upon him by his own weapons, every now and thenhe would look up and supplicate him, as it were, with muteentreaties. Elpis,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> not wishing to risk trusting himself to<pb n="2272" />so formidable a beast, remained stationary for some time, moreat last from astonishment than from fear. At length, however, he descended from the tree and extracted the bone, thelion in the meanwhile extending his head, and aiding in theoperation as far as it was necessary for him to do. The storygoes on to say, that as long as the vessel remained off thatcoast, the lion showed his sense of gratitude by bringing whatever he had chanced to procure in the chase. In memory ofthis circumstance, Elpis consecrated a temple at Samos to FatherLiber, which the Greeks, from the circumstance above related,called "the temple <foreign lang="greek">xeXhno/tos Dionu/sou,</foreign>" or "of the open-mouthedBacchus." Can we wonder, after this, that the wild beastsshould be able to recognize the footsteps of man,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> when ofhim alone of all animals they even hope for aid? For whyshould they not have recourse to others for assistance? Or howis it that they know that the hand of man has power to healthem? Unless, perhaps, it is that the violence of pain canforce wild beasts even to risk every thing to obtain relief.</p><p>(17.) Demetrius, the natural philosopher, relates an equallyremarkable instance, in relation to a panther.<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> The animal waslying in the middle of the road, waiting for some one to passthat way, when he was suddenly perceived by the father of one<pb n="2273" />Philinus, an ardent lover of wisdom.<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> Seized with fear, heimmediately began to retreat; while the beast rolled itselfbefore him, evidently with the desire of caressing him, at thesame time manifesting signs of grief, which could not bemisunderstood in a panther even. The animal had young ones,which had happened to fall into a pit at some distance fromthe place. The first dictates of compassion banished all fear,and the next prompted him to assist the animal. He accordingly followed her, as she gently drew him on by fixingher claws in his garment; and as soon as he discovered whatwas the cause of her grief and the price of his own safety, hetook the whelps out of the pit, and they followed her to theend of the desert; whither he was escorted by her, friskingwith joy and gladness, in order that she might more appropriately testify how grateful she was, and how little she hadgiven him in return; a mode of acting which is but rarelyfound, among men even.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Sagum." This was the cloak worn by the Roman soldiers and inferior officers, in contradistinction to the "paludamentum" of the generaland superior officers. It was open in the front, and usually, though notalways, fastened across the shoulders by a clasp. It was thick, and madeof wool.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This story is given also by Plutarch, in the life of Demetrius. Lysimachus was a Macedonian by birth, but son of Agathocles, a serf of Thessaly. Through his great courage, he became one of the body-guard ofAlexander. Quintus Curtius tells us that, when hunting in Syria, hekilled a lion of immense size single-handed, though not without receivingsevere wounds in the contest. The same author looks upon this as theprobable origin of the story here referred to by Pliny.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is mentioned by many ancient authors; by Plutarch, Pausanias,Seneca, Justin, and by Quintus Curtius, who thinks that the account usuallygiven is fabulous.—B.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Related by Plutarch, as among the acts of extravagance and folly,committed by Antony, which gave much disgust to the grave and respectable citizens of Rome.—B.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A famous courtezan of the time of Cicero; being originally the freed-woman and mistress of Volumnius Eutrapelus, and then successively themistress of Antony and the poet Gallus, who mentioned her in his poemsunder the name of Lycoris; she did not, however, continue faithful to him.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aulus Gellius, B. v. c. 14, and Ælian, Anim.

In Sillig's edition, whichis generally followed, it runs to this effect: "Neque profugienti, cum potuisset, fera institerat et procumbens ad arborem hiatu quo terruerat miserationem quærebat. Os morsu avidiore inhæserat dentibus cruciabatqueinedia, turn pœna in ipsis ejus telis suspectantem ac velut mutis precibusorantem, dum fortuitu fidens non est contra feram; multoque diutiusmiraculo quam metu cessatum est." Thus paraphrased by Sillig, whodevotes a long Note to it: "The lion, therefore, being tormented byhunger and excessive pain, and thus punishing himself for his greedinessin his own weapons (his teeth), looked up, and besought Elpis with silentprayers, as it were, not, as he trusted to the protection fortuitously givenby the branches, to show himself distrustful of a wild beast."</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This remark refers to what Pliny has related in c. 5, respecting thesagacity of the elephant.—B.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier remarks, that this "panthera" is not the same as the <foreign lang="greek">pa/nqhr</foreign>of the Greeks. From the description of its spots and other circumstances,he thinks that it was one of the African animals, known by modern naturalists as the leopard, which appear to have been confounded by the Romanswith the panther. The term "leopardus " is not met with until after theage of Pliny; it was supposed to be the produce of the pardus, or malepanther, and the lioness.—B.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Assectatoris sapientiæ"—"A follower of wisdom;" meaning a"philosopher."</p></body>
