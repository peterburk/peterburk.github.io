Sisymlbrium,too, is planted in a similar manner; it grows to the greatestperfection upon the walls of wells, and around fish preservesand ponds.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hardouin, from Theophrastus, Hist. Plant. B. vi. c. 7, suggests areading, "whence the streams bring down branches of them torn off, andso plant them."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The plants, Fée says, that we find in these localities, are nearlyalways ferns, or else Marchantia, or mosses of the genus Hypnum. Féequeries whether one of these may not have been the sisymbrium of Pliny.Water-cresses, again, have been suggested.</p></body>
