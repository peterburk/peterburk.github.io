These risings and settings may be observed in twodifferent ways:—The stars are either concealed, and cease tobe seen at the rising of the sun, or else present themselves toour view at his setting—this last being more generally knownby the name of "emersion" than of "rising," while their dis-<pb n="4078" />appearance is rather an "occultation" than a "setting."—Considered, again, in another point of view, when upon certain daysthey begin to appear or disappear, at the settingor the rising of the sun, as the case may be, these are calledtheir morning or their evening settings or risings, accordingas each of these phenomena takes place at day-break or twilight.It requires an interval of three quarters of an hour at least beforethe rising of the sun or after his setting, for the stars tobe visible to us. In addition to this, there are certain starswhich rise and set twice.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> All that we here state bearsreference, it must be remembered, to the fixed stars only.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See c. 69, as to Arcturus and Aquila.</p></body>
