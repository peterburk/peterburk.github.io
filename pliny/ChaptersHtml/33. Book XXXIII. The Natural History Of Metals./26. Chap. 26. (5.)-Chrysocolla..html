(5.)—CHRYSOCOLLA.</head><p>Chrysocolla<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> is a liquid which is found in the shafts alreadymentioned,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> flowing through the veins of gold; a kind ofslime which becomes indurated by the cold of winter till ithas attained the hardness even of pumice. The most esteemedkind of it, it has been ascertained, is found in copper-mines,the next best being the produce of silver-mines: it is foundalso in lead-mines, but that found in combination with goldore is much inferior.</p><p>In all these mines, too, an artificial chrysocolla is manu-<pb n="6108" />factured; much inferior, however, to the native chrysocolla.The method of preparing it consists in introducing watergradually into a vein of metal, throughout the winter and untilthe month of June; after which, it is left to dry up duringthe months of June and July: so that, in fact, it is quite evidentthat chrysocolla is nothing else but the putrefaction of a metallicvein. Native chrysocolla, known as "uva," differs fromthe other in its hardness more particularly; and yet, hard asit is, it admits of being coloured with the plant known as"lutum."<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> Like flax and wool, it is of a nature which imbibesliquids. For the purpose of dyeing it, it is first bruised in amortar, after which, it is passed through a fine sieve. Thisdone, it is ground, and then passed through a still finer sieve;all that refuses to pass being replaced in the mortar, and subjectedonce more to the mill. The finest part of the powder isfrom time to time measured out into a crucible, where it ismacerated in vinegar, so that all the hard particles may bedissolved; after which, it is pounded again, and then rinsedin shell-shaped vessels, and left to dry. This done, the chrysocollais dyed by the agency of schist alum<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and the plantabove-mentioned; and thus is it painted itself before it servesto paint. It is of considerable importance, too, that it shouldbe absorbent and readily take the dye: indeed, if it does notspeedily take the colour, scytanum and turbistum<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> are added tothe dye; such being the name of two drugs which compel it toabsorb the colouring matter.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It has been supposed by some, that the "Chrysocolla" of the ancients,as well as the "Cæruleum," mentioned in c. 57 of this Book, were the produceof cobalt; but the more generally received opinion is that "chrysocolla"(gold-solder) was green verditer, or mountain-green, carbonate andhydrocarbonate of copper, green and blue, substances which are sometimesfound in gold mines, but in copper mines more particularly. It must notbe confounded with the modern chrysocolla or Borax.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In Chapter 21 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The "Reseda luteola," Dyer's weed, or Wild woad.
