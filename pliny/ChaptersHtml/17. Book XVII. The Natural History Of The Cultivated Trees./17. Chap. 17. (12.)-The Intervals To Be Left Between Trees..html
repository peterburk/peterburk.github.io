<div2 type="chapter" n="17" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 17. (12.)ÑTHE INTERVALS TO BE LEFT BETWEEN TREES.</head><p>The present seems to me to be the proper occasion for makingsome mention of the intervals<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> that ought to be left betweenthe trees. Some persons have recommended that pomegra-nates, myrtles, and laurels should be planted closer together thanthe other trees, leaving, however, a space of nine feet betweenthem. Apple-trees, they say, should be planted a little widerapart, and pear-trees, almonds, and figs even still more so.The best rule, however, is to consult the length of the branches,and the nature of the spot, as well as the shade that is formedby the tree; for it is of great importance to take this last intoconsideration. The shadow thrown by the large trees even isbut of small dimensions, when the branches are disposed around<pb n="3473" />the body of the tree in a spherical form, as in the apple andthe pear, for instance. In the cherry, on the other hand, andthe laurel, the shadow projected is of enormous extent.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is from Theophrastus, Hist. Plant. ii. 7. The question, however, depends entirely upon the nature of the tree, the quality of the soil,and various other considerations, as Pliny himself admits.</p></body>
