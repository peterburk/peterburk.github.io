<div2 type="chapter" n="34" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 34.—TROGLODYTICE.</head><p>Troglodytice comes next, by the ancients called Midoë, andby some Michoë; here is Mount Pentedactylos, some islandscalled Stenæ Deiræ,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> the Halonnesi,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> a group of islandsnot less in number, Cardamine, and Topazos,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> which last hasgiven its name to the precious stone so called. The gulf isfull of islands; those known as Mareu are supplied withfresh water, those called Erenos, are without it; these wereruled by governors<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> appointed by the kings. In the interior<pb n="2094" />are the Candei, also called Ophiophagi, a people in the habitof eating serpents; there is no region in existence more productive of them.</p><p>Juba, who appears to have investigated all these matterswith the greatest diligence, has omitted, in his description ofthese regions—unless, indeed, it be an error in the copying—another place called Berenice and surnamed Panchrysos,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> asalso a third surnamed Epidires,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> and remarkable for thepeculiarity of its site; for it lies on a long projecting neck ofland, at the spot where the Straits at the mouth of the RedSea separate the coast of Africa from Arabia by a distanceof seven miles only: here too is the island of Cytis,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> whichalso produces the topaz.</p><p>Beyond this are forests, in which is Ptolemais,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> built byPhiladelphus for the chase of the elephant, and thence calledEpitheras,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> situate near Lake Monoleus. This is the same regionthat has been already mentioned by us in the Second Book,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>and in which, during forty-five days before the summer solsticeand for as many after, there is no shadow at the sixth hour, andduring the other hours of the day it falls to the south; while atother times it falls to the north; whereas at the Berenice ofwhich we first<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> made mention, on the day of the summer solsticethe shadow totally disappears at the sixth hour, but no otherunusual phænomenon is observed. That place is situate at adistance of six hundred and two miles from Ptolemais, which<pb n="2095" />has thus become the subject of a remarkable theory, and haspromoted the exercise of a spirit of the most profound investigation; for it was at this spot that the extent of the earth wasfirst ascertained, it being the fact that Erastosthenes, beginningat this place by the accurate calculation of the length of theshadow, was enabled to determine with exactness the dimensions of the earth.</p><p>After passing this place we come to the Azanian<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> Sea, apromontory by some writers called Hispalus, Lake Mandalum,and the island of Colocasitis, with many others lying out inthe main sea, upon which multitudes of turtles are found.We then come to the town of Suche, the island of Daphnidis,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>and the town of the Adulitæ,<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> a place founded by Egyptianrunaway slaves. This is the principal mart for the Troglodyte,as also for the people of Æthiopia: it is distant from Ptolemaisfive days' sail. To this place they bring ivory in large quantities, horns of the rhinoceros, hides of the hippopotamus, tortoise-shell, sphingiæ,<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> and slaves. Beyond the Æthiopian Aroteræ are the islands known by the name of Aliæu,<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> as also thoseof Bacchias, Antibacchias, and Stratioton. After passing these,on the coast of Æthiopia, there is a gulf which remains unexplored still; a circumstance the more to be wondered at, seeingthat merchants have pursued their investigations to a greaterdistance than this. We then come to a promontory, uponwhich there is a spring called Cucios,<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> much resorted to by<pb n="2096" />mariners. Beyond it is the Port of Isis, distant ten days'rowing from the town of the Adulitæ: myrrh is brought to thisport by the Troglodytæ. The two islands before the harbourare called Pseudepylæ,<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> and those in it, the same in number,are known as Pylæ;<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> upon one of these there are some stonecolumns inscribed with unknown characters. Beyond these isthe Gulf of Abalites, the island of Diodorus,<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> and other desert islands; also, on the mainland, a succession of deserts, andthen the town of Gaza, and the promontory and port of Mossylum,<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> to the latter of which cinnamon is brought for exportation: it was thus far that Sesostris led<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> his army.</p><p>Some writers place even beyond this, upon the shore, onetown of Ethiopia, called Baricaza. Juba will have it that atthe Promontory of Mossylum<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span> the Atlantic Sea begins, and thatwith a north-west wind<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span> we may sail past his native country, theMauritanias, and arrive at Gades. We ought not on this occasion to curtail any portion of the opinions so expressed by him.He says that after we pass the promontory of the Indians,<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span>known as Lepteacra, and by others called Drepanum, the distance, in a straight line, beyond the island of Exusta andMalichu, is fifteen hundred miles; from thence to a placecalled Sceneos two hundred and twenty-five; and from thence tothe island of Adanu one hundred and fifty miles; so that the dis-<pb n="2097" />tance to the open sea<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span> is altogether eighteen hundred andseventy-five miles. All the other writers, however, are ofopinion that, in consequence of the intensity of the sun's heat,this sea is not navigable; added to which, commerce isgreatly exposed to the depredations of a piratical tribe ofArabians called Ascitæ,<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span> who dwell upon the islands: placingtwo inflated skins of oxen beneath a raft of wood, they ply theirpiratical vocation with the aid of. poisoned arrows. We learnalso from the same author that some nations of the Troglodytaehave the name of Therothoæ,<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span> being so called from their skillin hunting. They are remarkable for their swiftness, he says,just as the Ichthyophagi are, who can swim like the animalswhose element is the sea. He speaks also of the Bangeni, theGangoræ, the Chalybes, the Xoxinæ, the Sirechæ, the Daremæ,and the Domazames. Juba states, too, that the inhabitantswho dwell on the banks of the Nile from Syene as far as Meroë,are not a people of Æthiopia, but Arabians; and that the cityof the Sun, which we have mentioned<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span> as situate not farfrom Memphis, in our description of Egypt, was founded byArabians. There are some writers who take away the further bank of the Nile from Æthiopia,<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span> and unite it toAfrica;<span id="ref_31"><a href="#note_31">[31]</a></span> and they people its sides with tribes attracted thitherby its water. We shall leave these matters, however, to theoption of each, to form his opinion on them, and shall nowproceed to mention the towns on each side<span id="ref_32"><a href="#note_32">[32]</a></span> in the order inwhich they are given.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "narrow necks," apparently, from the Greek <foreign lang="greek">sthnai\ deirai\.</foreign> Ifthis be the correct reading, they were probably so called from the narrowstrait which ran between them.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">An island called Halonnesus has been already mentioned in B iv.c. 23.

It was an emporium on thecoast of the Red Sea for the trade with India and Arabia. It was chieflyremarkable for its position in mathematical geography, as, the sun havingbeen observed to be directly over it forty-five days before and after thesummer solstice, the place was taken as one of the points for determiningthe length of a degree of a great circle on the earth's surface.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From the Greek <foreign lang="greek">e)pi\ qh/ras,</foreign> "for hunting."</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. ii. c. 75.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In the same Chapter.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">So called from Azania, the adjoining coast of Africa, now known asthat of Ajan.

It is generally supposed that the modern Thulla orZulla, still pronounced Azoole, occupies its site, being situate in lat. 15'35' N. Ruins are said to exist there. D'Anville, however, in his mapof the Red Sea, places Adule at Arkeeko, on the same coast, and considerablyto the north of Thulla. According to Cosmas, Adule was about twomiles in the interior.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny gives a further description of this ape in B. viii. c. 21., and B. x.c. 72.

Salmasius seems with justice, notwithstanding the censures ofHardouin, to have found considerable difficulty in this passage.
