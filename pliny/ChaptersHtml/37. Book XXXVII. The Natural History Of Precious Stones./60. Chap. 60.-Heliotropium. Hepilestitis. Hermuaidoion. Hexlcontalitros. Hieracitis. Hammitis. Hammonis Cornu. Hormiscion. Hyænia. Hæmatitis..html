HÆMATITIS.</head><p>Heliotropium<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> is found in Æthiopia, Africa, and Cyprus:it is of a leek-green colour, streaked with blood-red veins. Ithas been thus named,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> from the circumstance that, if placedin a vessel of water and exposed to the full light of the sun,it changes to a reflected colour like that of blood; this beingthe case with the stone of Æthiopia more particularly. Outof the water, too, it reflects the figure of the sun like a mirror,and it discovers eclipses of that luminary by showing themoon passing over its disk. In the use of this stone, also, wehave a most glaring illustration of the impudent effronteryof the adepts in magic, for they say that, if it is combined withthe plant<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> heliotropium, and certain incantations are then repeatedover it, it will render the person invisible who carriesit about him.</p><p>Hephæsititis<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> also, though a radiant stone, partakes of theproperties of a mirror in reflecting objects. The mode oftesting it is to put it into boiling water, which should immediatelybecome cold. If exposed to the rays of the sun, itshould instantly cause dry fuel to ignite:<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> Corycus<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> is theplace where it is found. Hermuaidoion<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> is so called from the<pb n="6451" />resemblance to the male organs which it presents, on a groundthat is sometimes white, sometimes black, and sometimes ofa pallid hue, with a circle surrounding it of a golden colour.Hexecontalithos<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> receives its name from the numerous varietyof colours which, small as it is, it presents: it is found inTroglodytica.<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> Hieracitis<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> is entirely covered with mottledstreaks, resembling a kite's feathers alternately with black.Hammitis<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> is similar in appearance to the spawn of fish: thereis also one variety of it which has all the appearance of beingcomposed of nitre,<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> except that it is remarkably hard. Hammoniscornu<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> is reckoned among the most sacred gems ofÆthiopia; it is of a golden colour, like a ram's horn in shape,and ensures prophetic dreams, it is said.</p><p>Hormiscion<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> is one of the most pleasing stones to the sight;it is of a fiery colour, and emits rays like gold, tipped at theextremity with a whitish light. Hyænia<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> is derived from theeyes of the hyæna, it is said, the animal being hunted to obtainit; placed beneath the tongue, if we believe the story,it will enable a person to prophesy the future. Hæmatitis,<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span>of the very finest quality, comes from Æthiopia, but it is foundin Arabia and Africa as well. It is a stone of a blood-redcolour, and we must not omit to mention the assurance given[by the magicians], that the possession of it reveals treacherousdesigns on the part of the barbarians. Zachalias of Babylon,in the books which he dedicated to King Mithridates, attributingthe destinies of man to certain properties innate inprecious stones, is not content with vaunting the merits of thisstone as curative of diseases of the eyes and liver, but recommendsit also as ensuring success to petitions addressed tokings. He also makes it play its part in lawsuits and judg-<pb n="6452" />ments, and even goes so far as to say that it is highly beneficialto be rubbed with it on the field of battle. There is anotherstone of the same class, called "menui" by the people ofIndia, and "xanthos"<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> by the Greeks: it is of a whitish, tawnycolour.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now known as Heliotrope, bloodstone, or blood jasper.
