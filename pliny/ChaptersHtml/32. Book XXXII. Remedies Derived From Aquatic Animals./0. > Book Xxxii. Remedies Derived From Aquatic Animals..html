Ian. In a vast numberof passages previously looked upon as hopelessly corrupt, or else not at allsuspected of being in a mutilated state, this MS. supplies words and clauses,the existence of which in the original was hitherto unknown; indeed by itsaid the indefatigable Sillig has been enabled, if we may be allowed theterm, almost to <hi rend="ital">rewrite</hi> the last six Books of Pliny. From a perusal ofthese new readings, as Dr. Smith has justly remarked, we have reason toinfer "that the text of the earlier Books is still in a very defective state,and that much of the obscurity of Pliny may be traced to this cause."</p></body>
