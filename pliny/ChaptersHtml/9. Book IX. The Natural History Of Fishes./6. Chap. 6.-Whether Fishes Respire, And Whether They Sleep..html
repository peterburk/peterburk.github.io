<div2 type="chapter" n="6" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 6.—WHETHER FISHES RESPIRE, AND WHETHER THEY SLEEP.</head><p>Balænæ have the mouth<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> in the forehead; and hence it isthat, as they swim on the surface of the water, they dischargevast showers of water in the air. (7.) It is universally agreed,however, that they respire, as do a very few other animals<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>in the sea, which have lungs among the internal viscera; forwithout lungs it is generally supposed that no animal canbreathe. Those, too, who are of this opinion are of opinionalso that no fishes that have gills are so constituted as toinhale and exhale alternately, nor, in fact, many other kinds ofanimals even, which are entirely destitute of gills. This, I find,was the opinion of Aristotle,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> who, by his learned researches<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>on the subject, has induced many others to be of the sameway of thinking. I shall not, however, conceal the fact, thatI for one do not by any means at once subscribe to thisopinion, for it is very possible, if such be the will of Nature,that there may be other organs<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> fitted for the purposes ofrespiration, and acting in the place of lungs; just as in manyanimals a different liquid altogether takes the place of blood.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>And who, in fact, can find any ground for surprise that thebreath of life can penetrate the waters of the deep, when he<pb n="2368" />sees that it is even exhaled<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> from them? and when we find,too, that it can even enter the very depths of the earth, anelement of so much greater density, a thing that is proved bythe case of animals which always live under ground, the molefor instance? There are other weighty reasons as well, whichinduce me to be of opinion that all aquatic animals respire,conformably to their natural organization; for, in the first place,there has been often remarked in fishes a certain degree of anhelation during the heat of summer, and at other times again,a kind of leisurely gaping,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> as it were. And then, besides, wehave the admission of those who are of the contrary opinion,that fishes do sleep; but what possibility is there of sleeping<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>without respiring as well? And again, we see their breathdisengaged in bubbles which rise to the water's surface, andthe influence too of the moon makes even the very shells<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>grow in bulk.</p><p>But the most convincing reason of all is, the undoubted factthat fishes have the power of hearing<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> and of smelling, twosenses for the operation of both of which the air is a necessaryvehicle; for by smell we understand nothing else than the airbeing charged with certain particles.<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> However, let everyperson form his own opinion on these subjects, just in such wayas he may think best.</p><p>Neither the balæna nor the dolphin has any gills.<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> Both<pb n="2369" />of these animals respire<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> through vent-holes, which communicate with the lungs; in the balæna they are on the fore-head,<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> and in the dolphin on the back. Sea-calves, too, whichwe call "phocæ,"<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> breathe and sleep upon dry land—sea-tortoises also,<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> of which we shall have more to say hereafter.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Ora." Cuvier remarks, that it is not the "mouth of the animal butthe nostrils, that are situate on the top of the head, and that through theseit sends forth vast columns of water." Aristotle, in his Hist. Anim. B. i.c. 3, has a similar passage, from which Pliny copied this assertion of his.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier remarks, that these are the animals of the cetaceous class,which resemble the quadrupeds in the formation of the viscera, theirrespiration, and the mammæ; and which, in fact, only differ from them intheir general form, which more nearly resembles that of fishes.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 2.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Doctrinæ indaginibus." This certainly seems a better reading than"doctrina indignis," which has been adopted by Sillig, and which wouldmake complete nonsense of the passage.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Dalechamps states that Cælius Rhodiginus, B. iv. c. 15, has enteredvery fully into this subject.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier remarks, on this passage, that the mollusca have, instead ofblood, a kind of azure or colourless liquid. He observes also, that insectsrespire by means of tracheæ, or elastic tubes, which penetrate into everypart of the body; and that the gills of fish are as essentially an organ ofrespiration as the lungs. All, he says, that Pliny adds as to the introduction of air into water, is equally conformable to truth; and that it is bymeans of the air mingled with the water, or of the atmosphere which theyinhale at the surface, that fishes respire.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In the shape of vapour raised by the action of the sun. In accordance with this opinion, Cicero says, De Nat. Deor. B. ii. s. 27, "The airarises from the respiration of the waters, and must be looked upon as asort of vapour coming from them."</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">But, as Hardouin remarks, this act on the part of the fish is causedas much by the water as the air.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">As Hardouin remarks, this is a somewhat singular notion that sleepis produced by the action of the lungs.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hardouin asks, what this has to do with the question about the airwhich Pliny is here discussing? and then suggests that his meaning maypossibly be, that the moon has an influence on bodies through the mediumof the air, in accordance with the notion of the ancients that the respira-tion was more free during the time of full moon. Littré says, that Pliny'smeaning is, that since the influence of the moon is able to penetrate thewaters, the air and the vital breath can of course penetrate them also.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. x. c. 89, where this subject is further discussed.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Infectum aera."</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See Aristotle, De Part.
