<div2 type="chapter" n="6" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 6.ÑTHE SEVERITY OF THE ANCIENTS IN REFERENCE TO CHAPLETS.</head><p>Indeed the rules upon this point were remarkably severe.L. Fulvius, a banker,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> having been accused, at the time ofthe Second Punic War, of looking down from the balcony<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>of his house upon the Forum, with a chaplet of roses uponhis head, was imprisoned by order of the Senate, and was notliberated before the war was brought to a close. P. Munatius, havingplaced upon his head a chaplet of flowers takenfrom the statue of Marsyas,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> was condemned by the Triumviri to beput in chains. Upon his making appeal to thetribunes of the people, they refused to intercede in his behalfÑa very different state of things to that at Athens, wherethe young men,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> in their drunken revelry, were in the habit,<pb n="4308" />before midday, of making their way into the very schools ofthe philosophers even. Among ourselves, no such instance ofa similar licentiousness is to be found, unless, indeed, in thecase of the daughter<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> of the late Emperor Augustus, who, inher nocturnal debaucheries, placed a chaplet on the statue<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>of Marsyas, conduct deeply deplored in the letters of thatgod.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "money-changer," "argentarius."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"E pergul‰ su‰." Scaliger thinks that the "pergula" was a partof a house built out into the street, while, according to Ernesti, it was alittle room in the upper part of a house. In B. xxxv. c. 36, it clearlymeans a room on the ground-floor.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In the Fora of ancient cities there was frequently a statue ofthis mythological personage, with one hand erect, in token, Serviussays (onB. iv. 1. 58 of the ®neid), of the freedom of the state, Marsyas having beenthe minister of Bacchus, the god of liberty. His statue in the Forum ofRome was the place of assembly for the courtesans of that city, who usedto crown it with chaplets of flowers. See also Horace i. Sat. 6. 1. 120;Juvenal, Sat. 9. l. 1 and 2; and Martial,ii. Ep. 64. l. 7.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cujacius thinks that Pliny has in view here Polemen of Athens, whowhen a young man, in his drunken revelry, burst into the school ofXenocrates, the philosopher, with his fellow-revellers, wearing hisfestive garland on his head. Being arrested, however, by thediscourse, he stoppedto listen, and at length, tearing off the garland, determined to enter on amore abstemious course of life. Becoming an ardent disciple ofXenocrates, he ultimately succeeded him at the head of the school.The passage as given in the text, from its apparent incompleteness,would appear to be in a mutilated state.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Julia.
