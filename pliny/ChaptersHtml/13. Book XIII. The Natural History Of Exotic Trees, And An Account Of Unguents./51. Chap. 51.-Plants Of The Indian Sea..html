They have spoken also of bulrushes<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>of stone bearing a strong resemblance to real ones, which grewalong the sea-shore, as also certain shrubs<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> in the main sea,the colour of an ox's horn, branching out in various directions, and red at the tips. These, they say, were brittle, andbroke like glass when touched, while, on the other hand, inthe fire they would become red-hot like iron, and when coolresume their original colour.</p><p>In the same part of the earth also, the tide covers theforests that grow on the islands, although the trees there aremore lofty<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> than the very tallest of our planes and poplars!The leaves of these trees resemble that of the laurel, while theblossom is similar to the violet, both in smell and colour: theberries resemble those of the olive, and they, too, have anagreeable smell: they appear in the autumn, and the leavesof the trees never fall off. The smaller ones are entirelycovered by the waves, while the summits of those of largersize protrude from the water, and ships are made fast to them;when the tide falls the vessels are similarly moored to the roots.We find the same persons making mention of certain othertrees which they saw out at sea, which always retained theirleaves, and bore a fruit very similar to the lupine.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The companions of Onesicritus and Nearchus.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Fée hazards a conjecture that this may be the Gorgonia scirpea ofPallas, found in the Indian Seas.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">One of the Gorgoniæ, Fée thinks; but its characteristics are not sufficiently stated to enable us to identify it.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A fable worthy of Sinbad the Sailor!</p></body>
