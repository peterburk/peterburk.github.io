To what particularregion this name belongs, we have already<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> stated, itbeing that of a divinity<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> held in the highest veneration bythe nations in that part of the world. This statue was carriedoff during the wars of Antonius with the people of Parthia;and a witty saying is told, with reference to it, of one of theveterans of the Roman army, a native of Bononia. Entertainingon one occasion the late Emperor Augustus at dinner,he was asked by that prince whether he was aware that theperson who was the first to commit this violence upon thestatue, had been struck with blindness and paralysis, and thenexpired. To this he made answer, that at that very momentAugustus was making his dinner off of one of her legs, for thathe himself was the very man, and to that bit of plunder hehad been indebted for all his fortune.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span></p><p>As regards statues of human beings, Gorgias of Leontini<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>was the first to erect a solid statue of gold, in the Temple atDelphi, in honour of himself, about the seventieth<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> Olympiad:so great were the fortunes then made by teaching the art oforatory!</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Solid hammer-work," in opposition to works in metal, cast and hollowwithin.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. v. c. 20, most probably.

According to Valerius Maximus and other writers, a statueof solid gold was erected by the whole of Greece, in the temple at Delphi,in honour of Gorgias, who was distinguished for his eloquence and literaryattainments. The leading opinion of Gorgias was, that nothing had anyreal existence.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The ninetieth Olympiad, about the year <date value="-420" authname="-420">420</date> B.C., is much more probably the correct reading; as it was about the seventieth Olympiad, or somewhatlater, that Gorgias was born.</p></body>
