It is generally thought, too, that bats'brains are productive of a similar effect; there being two kindsof these brains, the red and the white. Some persons mixwith the brains the blood and liver of the same animal: others,again, boil down a viper in three semisextarii of oil, and, afterboning it, use it as a depilatory, first pulling out the hairsthat are wanted not to grow. The gall of a hedgehog is adepilatory, more particularly if mixed with bats' brains andgoats' milk: the ashes, too, of a burnt hedgehog are used for asimilar purpose. If, after plucking out the hairs that arcwanted not to grow, or if, before they make their appearance,the parts are well rubbed with the milk of a bitch with herfirst litter, no hairs will grow there. The same result is ensured, it is said, by using the blood of a tick taken from off adog, or else the blood or gall of a swallow.</p><p>(15.)
