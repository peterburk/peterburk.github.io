For if a circle is traced with iron, or apointed weapon is carried three times round them, it will preserveboth infant and adult from all noxious influences: ifnails, too, that have been extracted from a tomb, are driveninto the threshold of a door, they will prevent night-mare.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>A slight puncture with the point of a weapon, with which aman has been wounded, will relieve sudden pains, attendedwith stitches in the sides or chest. Some affections are curedby cauterization with red-hot iron, the bite of the mad dogmore particularly; for even if the malady has been fully developed,and hydrophobia has made its appearance, the patientis instantly relieved on the wound being cauterized.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> Water<pb n="6211" />in which iron has been plunged at a white heat, is useful, asa potion, in many diseases, dysentery<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> more particularly.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Nocturnas lymphationes."—B.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The <hi rend="ital">actual</hi> cautery, as it is termed, is occasionally employed, in certaindiseases, by the moderns, but I am not aware that it has been tried inhydrophobia.—B.
