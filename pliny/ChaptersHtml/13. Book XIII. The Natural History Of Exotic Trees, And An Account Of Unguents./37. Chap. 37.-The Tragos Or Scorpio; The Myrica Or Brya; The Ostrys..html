Italy produces the myrica, which some personscall the "tamarix;"<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and Achaia, the wild brya,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> remarkablefor the circumstance that it is only the cultivated kind thatbears a fruit, not unlike the gall-nut. In Syria and Egyptthis plant is very abundant. It is to the trees of this lastcountry that we give the name of "unhappy;"<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> but yet thoseof Greece are more unhappy still, for that country produces thetree known as "ostrya," or, as it is sometimes called, "ostrya,"<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>a solitary tree that grows about rocks washed by the water,and very similar in the bark and branches to the ash. It re-<pb n="3203" />sembles the pear-tree in its leaves, which, however, are a littlelonger and thicker, with wrinkled indentations running downthe whole length of the leaf. The seed of this tree resemblesbarley in form and colour. The wood is hard and solid; it issaid, that if it is introduced into a house, it is productive ofpainful deliveries and of shocking deaths.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxvii. c. 116.

FŽe says, in relation tothe myrica, that it would seem that the ancients united in one collectivename, several plants which resembled each other, not in their botanicalcharacteristics, but in outward appearance. To this, he says, is owingthe fact that Dioscorides calls the myrica a tree, Favorinus a herb;Dioscorides says that it is fruitful, Nicander and Pliny call it barren;Virgil calls it small, and Theophrastus says that it is large.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Fee thinks that it is the Tamarix orientalis of Delille.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Infelix," meaning "sterile."
