(23.)—OF THE DIMENSIONS OF THE WORLD.</head><p>The stadium is equal to 125 of our Roman paces, or 625 feet<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>.Posidonius<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> supposes that there is a space of not less than40 stadia around the earth, whence mists<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>, winds and clouds<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>proceed; beyond this he supposes that the air is pure andliquid, consisting of uninterrupted light; from the cloudedregion to the moon there is a space of 2,000,000 of stadia,<pb n="1054" />and thence to the sun of 500,000,000<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>. It is in consequenceof this space that the sun, notwithstanding his immensemagnitude, does not burn the earth. Many persons haveimagined that the clouds rise to the height of 900 stadia.These points are not completely made out, and are difficultto explain; but we have given the best account of them thathas been published, and if we may be allowed, in any degree,to pursue these investigations, there is one infallible geometrical principle, which we cannot reject. Not that we canascertain the exact dimensions (for to profess to do thiswould be almost the act of a madman), but that the mindmay have some estimate to direct its conjectures. Now it isevident that the orbit through which the sun passes consistsof nearly 366 degrees, and that the diameter is always the thirdpart and a little less than the seventh of the circumference<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>.Then taking the half of this (for the earth is placed in thecentre) it will follow, that nearly one-sixth part of the immense space, which the mind conceives as constituting theorbit of the sun round the earth, will compose his altitude.That of the moon will be one-twelfth part, since her courseis so much shorter than that of the sun; she is thereforecarried along midway between the sun and the earth<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>. Itis astonishing to what an extent the weakness of the mindwill proceed, urged on by a little success, as in the abovementioned instance, to give full scope to its impudence!Thus, having ventured to guess at the space between the sunand the earth, we do the same with respect to the heavens,because he is situated midway between them; so that we maycome to know the measure of the whole world in inches.For if the diameter consist of seven parts, there will betwenty-two of the same parts in the circumference; as if wecould measure the heavens by a plumb-line!</p><p>The Egyptian calculation, which was made out by Petosi-<pb n="1055" />ris and Necepsos, supposes that each degree of the lunarorbit (which, as I have said, is the least) consists of littlemore than 33 stadia; in the very large orbit of Saturn thenumber is double; in that of the sun, which, as we havesaid, is in the middle<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>, we have the half of the sum of thesenumbers. And this is indeed a very modest calculation<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>,since if we add to the orbit of Saturn the distance from himto the zodiac, we shall have an infinite number of degrees<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hence the passus will be equal to 5 Roman feet.

See Adam's Roman Antiquities, p. 503; also the articlesMiliare and Pes in Smith's Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities;and for the varieties of the stadium, as employed at different periods andin different countries, see the article Stadium. The stadium which Herodotus employed in measurements of Babylon has been supposed toconsist of 490 English feet, while that of Xenophon and Strabo has beenestimated at 505; see Ed. Rev. xlviii. 190. The Abbé Barthelemisupposes the stadium to be equal to 604 English feet; Anach.
