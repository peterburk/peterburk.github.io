At a distance of one hundredand fifty stadia from the Mediterranean, between MountLibanus and another mountain of no note (and not, as somehave supposed, Antilibanus), there is a valley of moderatesize, situate in the vicinity of a lake, the marshy swamps ofwhich are dried up every summer. At a distance of thirtystadia from this lake grow the sweet-scented calamus andrush. We shall here make some further mention of this rushas well, although we have set apart another Book for plantsof that description, seeing that it is our object here to describe all the different materials used for unguents. Theseplants differ in appearance in no respect from others of theirkind; but the calamus, which has the more agreeable smell ofthe two, attracts by its odour at a considerable distance, andis softer to the touch than the other. The best is the kindwhich is not so brittle, but breaks into long flakes, and notshort, like a radish. In the hollow stalk there is a substancelike a cobweb, which is generally known by the name of the"flower:" those plants which contain the most of it areesteemed the best. The other tests of its goodness are itsbeing of a black colour—those which are white not beingesteemed; besides which, to be of the very best quality itshould be short, thick, and pliant when broken. The price ofthe scented calamus is eleven, and of the rush fifteen denariiper pound. It is said that the sweet-scented rush is to be metwith also in Campania.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Fée remarks, that this must not be confounded with the Calamusaromaticus of the moderns, of which Pliny speaks in B. xxv. c. 100, withsufficient accuracy to enable us to identify it with the Acorus calamus ofLinnæus. It is not ascertained by naturalists what plant is meant byPliny in the present instance, though Fée is of opinion that a gramineousplant of the genus Andropogon is meant. M. Guibourt has suggested thatthe Indian Gentiana chirayta is the plant. From what Pliny says in B.xiii. c. 21, it appears that this calamus grew in Syria, which is also thenative country of the Andropogon schœnauthus.</p></body>
