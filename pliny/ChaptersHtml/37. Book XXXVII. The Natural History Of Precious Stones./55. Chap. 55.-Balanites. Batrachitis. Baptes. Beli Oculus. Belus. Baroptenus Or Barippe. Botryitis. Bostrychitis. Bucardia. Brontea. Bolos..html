<div2 type="chapter" n="55" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 55.â€”BALANITES. BATRACHITIS. BAPTES. BELI OCULUS.BELUS. BAROPTENUS OR BARIPPE. BOTRYITIS. BOSTRYCHITIS.BUCARDIA. BRONTEA. BOLOS.</head><p>Of balamites<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> there are two kinds, the one of a greenish hue,and the other like Corinthian bronze in appearance; the formercomes from Coptos, and the latter from Troglodytica. Theyare both of them intersected by a flame-like vein, which runsthrough the middle. Coptos, too, sends us batrachitis;<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> onekind of which is like a frog in colour, another has the tint ofebony, and a third is blackish inclining to red. Baptes<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> is asoft stone, and of a most excellent smell. Beli oculus<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> is astone of a whitish hue, surrounding a black pupil in the middle,which shines amid a lustre like that of gold. This stone, inconsequence of its singular beauty, has been consecrated to thedeity<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> held in the highest veneration by the people of Assyria.According to Democritus, there is also a stone called belus,and found at Arbela; it is about the size of a walnut, andlooks<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> like glass. Baroptenus or barippe is black, and covered<pb n="6444" />with knots of a white and blood-red colour: the use of it asan amulet is avoided, as being apt to produce monstrosities.</p><p>Botryitis<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> is sometimes black and sometimes purple-red,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>and resembles a bunch of grapes<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> in form, when making itsfirst appearance. Zoroaster says, that bostrychitis<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> is a stonewhich is more like the hair of females than anything else.Bucardia<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> resembles an ox-heart in appearance, and is onlyfound at Babylon. Brontea<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> is a stone like the head of atortoise, which falls with thunder, it is supposed: if too, weare to believe what is said, it has the property of quenchingthe fire in objects that have been struck by lightning. Bolos<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>is the name of a stone found in Iberia,<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> similar to a clod ofearth in appearance.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Acorn stone." Like an olive in appearance, and now known as"Jew stone," probably, a fossil.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Frog-stone." Varieties of quartz, probably.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Dipped stone." Dalechamps says that it was amber stained withalkanet, but on what authority does not appear.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Eye of Belus." Supposed by Ajasson and Desfontaines to be Cat'seye Chalcedony. See Chapter 50, Note 10.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Belus, the father of Ninus, the "Bel" of Scripture. See Chapter 58.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A kind of Tecolithos, Dalechamps says. See B. xxxvi. c. 35, andChapter 68 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Grape-cluster stone."</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Puniceus" seems to be a preferable reading to "pampineus,""like a vine-tendril," given by the Bamberg MS.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Possibly it may have been Datholite or Borate of lime, a variety ofwhich is known as Botryolite.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Hair-stone." This was probably either Iron alum, known also asAlun de plume; Alunogen, known also as Feather Alum or hair salt; orAmianthus, also called satin Asbestus. See B. xxxvi. c 31.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Ox-heart." Supposed to be a sort of Turquois, Hardouin says.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Thunder-stone.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Clod-stone." It may possibly have been a kind of Geodes. SeeB. xxxvi. c. 32. Dalechamps, however, identifies it with Crapaudine,Toad-stone, or Bufonite, supposed in former times to be produced by thetoad, but in reality the fossil tooth of a fish.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. iii. c. 4.</p></body>
