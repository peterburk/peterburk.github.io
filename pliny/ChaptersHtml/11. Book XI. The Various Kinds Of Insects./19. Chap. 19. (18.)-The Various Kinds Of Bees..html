<div2 type="chapter" n="19" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 19. (18.)ÑTHE VARIOUS KINDS OF BEES.</head><p>There are field bees also, and wild bees, ungainly in appear-ance, and much more irascible than the others, but remarkablefor their laboriousness and the excellence of their work. Ofdomestic bees there are two sorts; the best are those withshort bodies, speckled all over, and of a compact round shape.Those that are long, and resemble the wasp in appearance,are an inferior kind; and of these last, the very worst of allare those which have the body covered with hair. In Pontusthere is a kind of white bee, which makes honey twice amonth. On the banks of the river Thermodon there aretwo kinds found, one of which makes honey in the trees, theother under ground: they form a triple row of combs, andproduce honey in the greatest abundance.Nature has provided bees with a sting, which is inserted inthe abdomen of the insect. There are some who think thatat the first blow which they inflict with this weapon they willinstantly die,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> while others, again, are of opinion that such isnot the case, unless the animal drives it so deep as to causea portion of the intestines to follow; and they assert, also,that after they have thus lost their sting they become drones,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span><pb n="3021" />and make no honey, being thus castrated, so to say, andequally incapable of inflicting injury, and of making themselvesuseful by their labours. We have instances stated of horsesbeing killed by bees.</p><p>They have a great aversion to bad smells, and fly awayfrom them; a dislike which extends to artificial perfumeseven. Hence it is that they will attack persons who smellof unguents. They themselves, also, are exposed to theattacks of wasps and hornets, which belong to the same class,but are of a degenerate<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> nature; these wage continual warfareagainst them, as also does a species of gnat, which is knownby the name of " mulio;"<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> swallows, too, and various otherbirds prey upon them. Frogs lie in wait for them when inquest of water, which, in fact, is their principal occupationat the time they are rearing their young. And it is not onlythe frog that frequents ponds and streams that is thus injurious to them, but the bramble-frog as well, which will cometo the hives even in search of them, and, crawling up to theentrance, breathe through the apertures; upon hearing which, abee flies to the spot, and is snapped up in an instant. It isgenerally stated that frogs are proof against the sting of thebee. Sheep, too, are peculiarly dangerous to them, as theyhave the greatest difficulty in extricating themselves fromthe fleece. The smell of crabs,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> if they happen to be cooked intheir vicinity, is fatal to them.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">If it is left in the wound, the insect dies, being torn asunder.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Of course this is fabulous, as the drones are males.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Though belonging to the same class, they are not of degenerate kinds.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The "mule-gnat."</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See Virgil, Georg.
