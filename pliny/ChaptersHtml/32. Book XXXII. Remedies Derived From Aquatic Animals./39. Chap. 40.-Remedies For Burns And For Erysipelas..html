Live frogs act as a check upon crysipelas, the bellyside being applied to the part affected: it is recommended,too, to attach them lengthwise by the hinder legs, so as torender them more beneficial by reason of their increased respiration.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>Heads, too, of salted siluri<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> are reduced to ashesand applied with vinegar.</p><p>Prurigo and itch-scab, not only in man but in quadrupeds<pb n="6050" />as well, are most efficaciously treated with the liver of thepastinaca<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> boiled in oil.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Crebriore anhelitu."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. ix. cc. 17, 25, 75.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or sting-ray.
