These last spring from a grub of largersize, with two horns of very peculiar appearance. Thelarva then becomes a caterpillar, after which it assumes thestate in which it is known as <hi rend="ital">bombylis,</hi> then that called <hi rend="ital">necy-</hi><hi rend="ital">dalus,</hi> and after that, in six months, it becomes a silk-worm.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span><pb n="3026" />These insects weave webs similar to those of the spider, thematerial of which is used for making the more costly andluxurious garments of females, known as " bombycina." Pamphile, a woman of Cos,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> the daughter of Platea, was the first<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>person who discovered the art of unravelling these webs andspinning a tissue therefrom; indeed, she ought not to be deprived of the glory of having discovered the art of makingvestments which, while they cover a woman, at the same moment reveal her naked charms.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Called "bombyx" also; though, as Cuvier remarks, of a kind altogether different from the preceding one.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The first kinds of silk dresses worn by the Roman ladies were fromthis island, and, as Pliny says, were known by the name of <hi rend="ital">Coca vestes.</hi>These dresses were so fine as to be transparent, and were sometimes dyedpurple, and enriched with stripes of gold. They probably had their namefrom the early reputation which Cos acquired by its manufactures of silk.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This account is derived from Aristotle, Hist.
