<div2 type="chapter" n="79" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 79. (77.)â€”OF THE MODE IN WHICH THE DAYS ARECOMPUTED.</head><p>The days have been computed by different people in different ways.The Babylonians reckoned from one sunriseto the next; the Athenians from one sunset to the next; theUmbrians from noon to noon; the multitude, universally,from light to darkness; the Roman priests and those whopresided over the civil day, also the Egyptians and Hipparchus, frommidnight to midnight<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>. It appears that the interval from one sunriseto the next is less near the solsticesthan near the equinoxes, because the position of the zodiacis more oblique about its middle part, and more straightnear the solstice<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A. Gellius, iii. 3, informs us, that the question concerning thecommencement of the day was one of the topics discussed by Varro, inhisbook "Rerum Humanarum:" this work is lost. We learn from thenotes of Hardouin, Lemaire, i. 399, that there are certain countries inwhich all these various modes of computation are still practised; thelast-mentioned is the one commonly employed in Europe.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It has been supposed, that in this passage the author intended tosay no more than that the nights are shorter at the summer solstice thanat the other parts of the year; see Alexandre in Lemaire, i. 399, 400.But to this, I conceive, it may be objected, that the words "inter ortussolis" can scarcely apply to the period while the sun is below the horizon,and that the solstices generally would seem to be opposed to the equinoxesgenerally. Also the words "obliquior" and "rectior" would appear tohave some farther reference than merely to the length of time duringwhich the sun is above or below the horizon.</p></body>
