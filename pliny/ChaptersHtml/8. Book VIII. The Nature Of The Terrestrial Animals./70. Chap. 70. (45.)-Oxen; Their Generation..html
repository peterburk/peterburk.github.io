<div2 type="chapter" n="70" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 70. (45.)—OXEN; THEIR GENERATION.</head><p>We find it stated, that the oxen of India are of the height<pb n="2327" />of camels, and that the extremity of their horns are four feetasunder. In our part of the world the most valuable oxen arethose of Epirus, owing, it is said, to the attention paid totheir breed by King Pyrrhus.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> This perfection was acquiredby not permitting them to breed until after their fourth year.By these means he brought them to a very large size, and descendants of this breed are still to be seen at the present day.But in our times, we set heifers to breed in their first year, or,at the latest, in their second. Bulls are fit for breeding in theirfourth year; one being sufficient, it is said, for ten cows duringthe whole year. If the bull, after covering, goes to the rightside, the produce will be a male; if to the left, a female.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>Conception takes place after a single union; but if, by anyaccident, it should not have taken place, the cow seeks themale again, at the end of twenty days. She brings forth inthe tenth month; whatever may be produced before that timecannot be reared. Some writers say, that the birth takes placethe very day on which the tenth month is completed. Thisanimal but rarely produces twins. The time of covering beginsat the rising of the Dolphin, the day before the nones ofJanuary,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and continues for the space of thirty days. Sometimes it takes place in the autumn; and among those nationswhich live upon milk, they manage so as to have a supply ofit at all times of the year. Bulls never cover more than twicein the same day. The ox is the only animal that walks backwards while it is feeding; among the Garamantes, they feedin no other manner.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> The females live fifteen years at thelongest, and the males twenty; they arrive at their full vigourin their fifth year. It is said that they are made fat by being<pb n="2328" />washed in warm water, or by having the entrails inflated withair by means of a reed, introduced through an incision in theskin. We must not look upon those kinds as having degenerated, the appearance of which is not so favourable. Thosethat are bred in the Alps, although very small of body, give agreat quantity of milk, and are capable of enduring muchlabour; they are yoked by the horns, and not by the neck.The oxen of Syria have no dewlap, but they have a hump onthe back. Those of Caria also, which is in Asia, are unsightly<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> in appearance, having a hump hanging over theshoulders from the neck; and their horns are moveable;<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>they are said, however, to be excellent workers, though thosewhich are either black or white are condemned as worthless forlabour.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> The horns of the bull are shorter and thinner thanthose of the ox. Oxen must be broken in when they are threeyears old; after that time it is too late, and before that timetoo early. The ox is most easily broken in by yoking it withone that has already been trained.<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> This animal is our especial companion, both in labour generally, and in the operationsof agriculture. Our ancestors considered it of so much value,that there is an instance cited of a man being brought beforethe Roman people, on a day appointed, and condemned, forhaving killed an ox, in order to humour an impudent concubine of his, who said that she had never tasted tripe; and hewas driven into exile, just as though he had killed one of hisown peasants.<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span><pb n="2329" /></p><p>The bull has a proud air, a stern forehead, shaggy ears, andhorns which appear always ready, and challenging to the combat; but it is by his fore feet that he manifests his threateninganger. As his rage increases, he stands, lashing back histail<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> every now and then, and throwing up the sand againsthis belly; being the only animal that excites himself by thesemeans. We have seen them fight at the word of command, andshown as a public spectacle; these bulls whirled about andthen fell upon their horns, and at once were up again; then,at other times, they would lie upon the ground and let themselves be lifted up; they would even stand in a two-horsedchariot, while moving at a rapid rate, like so many charioteers.<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> The people of Thessaly invented a method of killingbulls, by means of a man on horseback, who would ride upto them, and seize one of the horns, and so twist their neck.Cæsar the Dictator was the first person who exhibited thisspectacle at Rome.</p><p>Bulls are selected as the very choicest of victims, and areoffered up as the most approved sacrifice for appeasing thegods.<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> Of all the animals that have long tails, this is theonly one whose tail is not of proportionate length at the moment of birth; and in this animal alone it continues to growuntil it reaches its heels. It is on this account, that in makingchoice of a calf for a victim, due care is taken that its tailreaches to the pastern joint; if it is shorter than this, thesacrifice is not deemed acceptable to the gods. This fact hasalso been remarked, that calves, which have been carried tothe altar on men's shoulders, are not generally acceptable tothe gods; and also, if they are lame, or of a species which isnot appropriate,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> or if they struggle to get away from the<pb n="2330" />altar. It was a not uncommon prodigy among the ancients,for an ox to speak;<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> upon such a fact being announced tothe senate, they were in the habit of holding a meeting inthe open air.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This alleged superiority is mentioned by Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. iii.c. 91, by Varro, B. ii. c. 5, and by Columella, B. vi. c. 1; but it is remarked by Dalechamps and Hardouin, that the appellation of Pyrrhic givento these oxen, was more probably derived from their red colour,<foreign lang="greek">pur)r(o\s,</foreign>than from the name of the king. The materials of this chapter are principally from the above writers, especially Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. vi. c.21, and B. viii. c. 7.—B.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This singular notion is mentioned by Varro and Columella, <hi rend="ital">ubi supra;</hi>Cuvier says, that it is the origin of the pretended secret of producing thesexes at pleasure, which was published by Millot; Ajasson, vol. vi. p.461.—B.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">4th January. See B. xviii. c. 64.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is mentioned by Herodotus, B. iv. c. 183; this peculiarity intheir mode of taking their food is ascribed to the extraordinary length ofthe horns; it is also mentioned by Ælian, Anim. Nat. B. xvi. c. 33.—B.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Fœdi visu." This is very similar to the expression used by Virgil,Georg. B. iii., when describing the points of an ox, 1. 52,—"oui turpicaput "—"the head of which is unsightly"—probably in allusion to itslarge size.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">According to Cuvier, there is an ox, in warm climates, which has amass of fat on the shoulders, and whose horns are only attached to theskin; Buffon has described it under the name of Zebu; Ajasson, vol. vi.p. 461; Lemaire, vol. iii. p. 512.—B.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Ad laborem damnantur;" with respect to the colour, Varro, B. ii.c. 5, has the following remarks: "The best colours are black, red, pale red,and white. The latter ones are the most delicate, the first the most hardy.Of the two middle ones, the first is the best, and both are more valuablethan the first and last."</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We have an account of this process in Columella, B. ii. c. 6.—B.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This anecdote is related by Valerius Maximus, B. viii. c. 1. Virgil,Georg. B. ii. 1. 537, speaks of the use of oxen in food, as a proof of the de-generacy of later times, and as not existing during the Golden Age; "AnteYmpia quam cœsis gens est epulata juvencis." This feeling is alluded to by. Ælian, Anim. Nat. B. xii. c. 34, and by Suetonius, Life of Domitian,c. ix.—B.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is doubtful whether this is the meaning of "alternos replicansorbes," or what indeed is the meaning. Most editions omit "orbes," thusmaking the matter still worse.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hardouin supposes that this alludes to the exhibition of oxen huntedat the exhibition of shows and in the Circus, for the gratification of theRoman people.—B.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Referred to by Virgil, Georg. B. ii. 11. 145, 146, "et maxima taurusVictima," "and the bull the largest victim of all."—B.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In reference to this remark, we may mention the passage in Virgil,Æn. B. iii. c. 119, "Taurum Neptuno, taurum tibi, pulcher Apollo." "Abull to thee, Neptune, a bull to thee, beauteous Apollo."</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Instances are mentioned by Livy, B. xxxv. c. 21, and by Val. Maximus, B. i. c. 65.—B.</p></body>
