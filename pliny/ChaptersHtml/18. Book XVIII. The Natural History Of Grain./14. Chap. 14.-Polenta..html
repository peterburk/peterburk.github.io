<div2 type="chapter" n="14" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 14.ÑPOLENTA.</head><p>Barley is one of the most ancient aliments of man, a factthat is proved by a custom of the Athenians, mentioned byMenander,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> as also by the name of "hordearii,"<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> that used tobe given to gladiators. The Greeks, too, prefer barley to anything else for making polenta.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> This food is made in variousways: in Greece, the barley is first steeped in water, and thenleft a night to dry. The next day they parch it, and thengrind it in the mill. Some persons parch it more highly, andthen sprinkle it again with a little water; after which theydry it for grinding. Others shake the grain from out of theear while green, and, aft¾r cleaning and soaking it in water,pound it in a mortar. They then wash the paste in baskets,and leave it to dry in the sun; after which they pound it again,clean it, and grind it in the mill. But whatever the mode ofpreparation adopted, the proportions are always twenty poundsof barley to three pounds of linseed,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> half a pound of coriander,and fifteen drachm¾<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> of salt: the ingredients are first parched,and then ground in the mill.</p><p>Those who want it for keeping, store it in new earthenvessels, with fine flour and bran. In Italy, the barley isparched without being steeped in water, and then ground to a<pb n="4029" />fine meal, with the addition of the ingredients already mentioned, and some millet as well. Barley bread, which wasextensively used by the ancients, has now fallen into universaldisrepute, and is mostly used as a food for cattle only.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The barley was, originally, the prize given to the victor in the Eleu-sinian games.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "barley-fed."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The <foreign lang="greek">a)lfi/ton</foreign> of the Greeks.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This, as FŽe observes, would tend to give it a very disagreeable flavour.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Acetabulum."</p></body>
