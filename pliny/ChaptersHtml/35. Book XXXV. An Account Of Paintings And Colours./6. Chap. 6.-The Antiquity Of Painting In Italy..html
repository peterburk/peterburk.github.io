They are both of the greatest beauty, the formerbeing evidently the figure of a virgin, and they still remainuninjured, though the temple is in ruins. The EmperorCaius,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> inflamed with lustfulness, attempted to have themremoved, but the nature of the plaster would not admit of it.There are in existence at C¾re,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> some paintings of a still higherantiquity. Whoever carefully examines them, will be forcedto admit that no art has arrived more speedily at perfection, seeing that it evidently was not in existence at the timeof the Trojan War.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ajasson remarks, that a great number of paintings have been latelydiscovered in the Etruscan tombs, in a very perfect state, and probably ofvery high antiquity.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There would appear to be still considerable uncertainty respectingthe nature of the materials employed by the ancients, and the manner ofapplying them, by which they produced these durable paintings; abranch of the art which has not been attained in equal perfection by themoderns.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Caligula.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. iii. c. 8.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We have already remarked that painting was practised very extensivelyby the Egyptians, probably long before the period of the Trojanwar.ÑB.</p></body>
