<div2 type="chapter" n="34" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 34.ÑTHE BEETLE. THE GLOW-WORM. OTHER KINDS OFBEETLES.</head><p>Some insects, for the preservation of their wings, are coveredwith a erust<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> the beetle, for instance, the wing of which ispeculiarly fine and frail. To these insects a sting has beendenied by Nature; but in one large kind<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> we find horns of aremarkable length, two-pronged at the extremities, and formingpincers, which the animal closes when it is its intention to<pb n="3034" />bite. These beetles are suspended from the neck of infants byway of remedy against certain maladies: Nigidius calls them"lucani." There is another kind<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> of beetle, again, which,as it goes backwards with its feet, rolls the dung into largepellets, and then deposits in them the maggots which form itsyoung, as in a sort of nest, to protect them against the rigoursof winter. Some, again, fly with a loud buzzing or a dronynoise, while others<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> burrow numerous holes in the hearthsand out in the fields, and their shrill chirrup is to be heard atnight.</p><p>The glow-worm, by the aid of the colour of its sides<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> andhaunches, sends forth at night a light which resembles that offire; being resplendent, at one moment, as it expands itswings,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> and then thrown into the shade the instant it hasshut them. These insects are never to be seen before the grassof the pastures has come to maturity, nor yet after the hay hasbeen cut. On the other hand, it is the nature of the blackbeetle<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> to seek dark corners, and to avoid the light: it ismostly found in baths, being produced from the humid vapourswhich arise therefrom. There are some beetles also, belongingto the same species, of a golden colour and very large size, whichburrow<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> in dry ground, and construct small combs of a porousnature, and very like sponge; these they fill with a poisonouskind of honey. In Thrace, near Olynthus, there is a smalllocality, the only one in which this animal cannot exist;from which circumstance it has received the name of " Cantharolethus."<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span></p><p>The wings of all insects are formed without<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> any division in<pb n="3035" />them, and they none of them have a tail,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> with the exceptionof the scorpion; this, too, is the only one among them that hasarms,<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> together with a sting in the tail. As to the rest of theinsects, some of them have the sting in the mouth, the gad-flyfor instance, or the "tabanus," as some persons choose to callit: the same is the case, too, with the gnat and some kinds offlies. All these insects have their stings situate in the mouthinstead<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> of a tongue; but in some the sting is not pointed,being formed not for pricking, but for the purpose of suction:this is the case more especially with flies, in which it is clearthat the tongue<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> is nothing more than a tube. These insects,too, have no teeth. Others, again, have little horns protruding in front of the eyes, but without any power in them;the butterfly, for instance. Some insects are destitute of wings,such as the scolopendra, for instance.<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or sheath; the Coleoptera of the naturalists.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The flying stag-beetle, the Lucanus cervus of Linn¾us.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The dung-beetle, the Scarab¾us pilularius of Linn¾us.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Various kinds of crickets.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier says that it is on the two sides of the abdomen that the malecarries its light, while the whole posterior part of the female is shining.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In the glow-worm of France, the Lampyris noctiluca of Linnt¾us, thefemale is without wings, while the male gives but little light.
