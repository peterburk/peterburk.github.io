Forso it is, that this is the only one among all the serpents thatfaces the cold, making its appearance the first of all, and evenbefore the cuckoo's note is heard. There is another marvellousfact also mentioned, with reference to the cuckoo: if, upon thespot where a person hears this bird for the first time, he tracesround the space occupied by his right foot and then digsup the earth, it will effectually prevent fleas from breeding,wherever it is thrown.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. viii. c. <hi rend="ital">35.</hi></p></body>
