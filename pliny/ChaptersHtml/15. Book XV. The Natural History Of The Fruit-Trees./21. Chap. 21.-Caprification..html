<div2 type="chapter" n="21" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 21.ÑCAPRIFICATION.</head><p>The fig, the only one among all the pomes, hastens to maturityby the aid of a remarkable provision of Nature. (19.) Thewild-fig,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> known by the name of "caprificus," never ripensitself, though it is able to impart to the others the principleof which it is thus destitute; for we occasionally find Naturemaking a transfer of what are primary causes, and being generated from decay. To effect this purpose the wild fig-tree<pb n="3312" />produces a kind of gnat.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> These insects, deprived of all sustenance from their parent tree, at the moment that it is hastening to rottenness and decay, wing their flight to others ofkindred though cultivated kind. There feeding with avidityupon the fig, they penetrate it in numerous places, and bythus making their way to the inside, open the pores of thefruit.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> The moment they effect their entrance, the heat ofthe sun finds admission too, and through the inlets thus madethe fecundating air is introduced. These insects speedilyconsume the milky juice that constitutes the chief supportof the fruit in its infant<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> state, a result which would otherwise be spontaneously effected by absorption: and hence it isthat in the plantations of figs a wild fig is usually allowed togrow, being placed to the windward of the other trees inorder that the breezes may bear from it upon them. Improvingupon this discovery, branches of the wild fig are sometimesbrought from a distance, and bundles tied together are placedupon the cultivated tree. This method, however, is not necessary when the trees are growing on a thin soil, or on a siteexposed to the north-east wind; for in these cases the figs willdry spontaneously, and the clefts which are made in the fruiteffect the same ripening process which in other instances isbrought about by the agency of these insects. Nor is it requisiteto adopt this plan on spots which are liable to dust, such, forinstance, as is generally the case with fig-trees planted by theside of much-frequented roads: the dust having the propertyof drying up<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> the juices of the fig, and so absorbing themilky humours. There is this superiority, however, in an ad.vantageous site over the methods of ripening by the agency ofdust or by caprification, that the fruit is not so apt to fall; forthe secretion of the juices being thus prevented, the fig is notso heavy as it would otherwise be, and the branches are lessbrittle.</p><p>All figs are soft to the touch, and when ripe contain grains<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span><pb n="3313" />in the interior. The juice, when the fruit is ripening, has thetaste of milk, and when dead ripe, that of honey. If left onthe tree they will grow old; and when in that state, theydistil a liquid that flows in tears<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> like gum. Those that aremore highly esteemed are kept for drying, and the most approved kinds are put away for keeping in baskets.<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> The figsof the island of Ebusus<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> are the best as well as the largest,and next to them are those of Marrucinum.<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> Where figs arein great abundance, as in Asia, for instance, huge jars<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>are filled with them, and at Ruspina, a city of Africa, we findcasks<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> used for a similar purpose: here, in a dry state, theyare extensively used instead of bread,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> and indeed as a generalarticle of provision.<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> Cato,<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> when laying down certain definite regulations for the support of labourers employed in agriculture, recommends that their supply of food should belessened just at the time<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> when the fig is ripening: it hasbeen a plan adopted in more recent times, to find a substitutefor salt with cheese, by eating fresh figs. To this class offruit belong, as we have already mentioned,<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> the cottana andthe carica, together with the cavnea,<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> which was productive ofso bad an omen to M. Crassus at the moment when he wasembarking<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> for his expedition against the Parthians, a dealerhappening to be crying them just at that very moment. L.Vitellius, who was more recently appointed to the censorship,<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> introduced all these varieties from Syria at his country-seat at Alba,<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> having acted as legatus in that province in thelatter years of the reign of Tiberius C¾sar.<pb n="3314" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Ficus Carica of Linn¾us.
