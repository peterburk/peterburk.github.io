<div2 type="chapter" n="23" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 23. (5.)ÑVEGETABLES OF A CARTILAGINOUS NATUREÑCUCUMBERS. PEPONES.</head><p>The cucumber<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> belongs to the cartilaginous class of plants,and grows above the ground. It was a wonderful favouritewith the Emperor Tiberius, and, indeed, he was never withoutit; for he had raised beds made in frames upon wheels,by means of which the cucumbers were moved and exposed tothe full heat of the sun; while, in winter, they were withdrawn,and placed under the protection of frames glazed with mirror-stone.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> We find it stated, also, by the ancient Greek writers,<pb n="4157" />that the cucumber ought to be propagated from seed that hasbeen steeped<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> a couple of days in milk and honey, this methodhaving the effect of rendering them all the sweeter to the taste.The cucumber, while growing, may be trained to take any formthat may be wished: in Italy the cucumbers are green<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> andvery small, while those grown in some of the provinces areremarkably large, and of a wax colour or black.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> Those ofAfrica, which are also remarkably prolific, are held in highesteem; the same, too, with the cucumbers of MÏesia, whichare by far the largest of all. When the cucumber acquires avery considerable volume, it is known to us as the "pepo."<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>Cucumbers when eaten remain on the stomach till the following day, and are very difficult<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> of digestion; still, for all that,in general they are not considered very unwholesome. Bynature they have a wonderful hatred to oil, and no less affection for water, and this after they have been cut from the stemeven.<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> If water is within a moderate distance of them, theywill creep towards it, while from oil, on the other hand, theywill shrink away: if any obstacle, too, should happen to arresttheir progress, or if they are left to hang, they will growcurved and crooked. Of these facts we may be satisfactorilyconvinced in a single night even, for if a vessel filled withwater is placed at four fingers' distance from a cucumber, itwill be found to have descended to it by the following morning; but if the same is done with oil, it will have assumed thecurved form of a hook by the next day. If hung in a tubewhile in blossom, the cucumber will grow to a most surprising<pb n="4158" />length.<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> It is only of late, too, that a cucumber of entirelynew shape has been produced in Campania, it having just theform of a quince.<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> It was quite by accident, I am told, thatthe first one acquired this shape in growing, and it was fromthe seed of this that all the others have been reproduced.The name given to this variety is "melopepo." These last donot grow hanging, but assume their round shape as they lieon the ground. A thing that is very remarkable in them, inaddition to their shape, colour, and smell, is the fact that,when ripe, although they do not hang from the stem, theyseparate from it at the stalk.</p><p>Columella<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> has given us a plan of his, by which we mayhave cucumbers the whole year round: the largest bramble-bush that can be procured is transplanted to a warm, sunnyspot, and then cut down, about the time of the vernal equinox,to within a couple of fingers of the ground; a cucumber-seedis then inserted in the pith of the bramble, and the roots arewell moulded up with fine earth and manure, to withstand thecold. According to the Greeks, there are three kinds of cu-cumbers, the Laconian, the Scytalic, and the BÏotian,<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> theLaconian being the only one among them that is fond<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> of thewater.</p><p>There are some persons who recommend steeping the seed ofthe cucumber in the juice of the herb known as the "culix;"<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>the produce, they say, will be sure to grow without seeds.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Cucumis sativus of Linn¾us.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Lapis specularis."
