<div2 type="chapter" n="4" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 4. (4.)—THE FIRST ARTISTS WHO EXCELLED IN THE SCULPTUREOF MARBLE, AND THE VARIOUS PERIODS AT WHICH THEYFLOURISHED. THE MAUSOLEUM IN CARIA. THE MOST CELEBRATEDSCULPTORS AND WORKS IN MARBLE, TWO HUNDRED ANDTWENTY-FIVE IN NUMBER.</head><p>The first artists who distinguished themselves in the sculptureof marble, were Dipœnus<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and Scyllis, natives of the Isleof Crete. At this period the Medians were still in power, andCyrus had not begun to reign in Persia; their date being aboutthe fiftieth Olympiad. They afterwards repaired to Sicyon, astate which for a length of time<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> was the adopted country ofall such pursuits as these. The people of Sicyon had made acontract with them for the execution of certain statues of thegods; but, before completing the work, the artists complainedof some injustice being done them, and retired to Ætolia. Immediatelyupon this, the state was afflicted with sterility andfamine, and dreadful consternation was the result. Uponenquiry being made as to a remedy for these evils, the PythianApollo made answer, that Dipœnus and Scyllis must completethe statues of the gods; an object which was attained at thecost of great concessions and considerable sums of money.The statues were those of Apollo,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> Diana, Hercules, andMinerva; the last of which was afterwards struck bylightning.</p><p>(5.) Before these artists were in existence, there had alreadyappeared Melas, a sculptor of the Isle of Chios; and, in successionto him, his son Micciades, and his grandson Archermus;<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>whose sons, Bupalus and Athenis, afterwards attained the highesteminence in the art. These last were contemporaries of thepoet Hipponax, who, it is well known, lived in the sixtiethOlympiad. Now, if a person only reckons, going upwardsfrom their time to that of their great-grandfather, he will find<pb n="6309" />that the art of sculpture must have necessarily originated aboutthe commencement of the era of the Olympiads. Hipponaxbeing a man notorious for his ugliness, the two artists, by wayof joke,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> exhibited a statue of him for the ridicule of the public.Indignant at this, the poet emptied upon them all thebitterness of his verses; to such an extent indeed, that, assome believe, they were driven to hang themselves in despair.This, however, is not the fact; for, at a later period, theseartists executed a number of statues in the neighbouring islands;at Delos for example, with an inscription subjoined to the effect,that Chios was rendered famous not only by its vines<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> but bythe works of the sons of Archermus as well. The people ofLasos<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> still show a Diana that was made by them; and wefind mention also made of a Diana at Chios, the work of theirhands: it is erected on an elevated spot, and the features appearstern to a person as he enters, and joyous as he departs.At Rome, there are some statues by these artists on the summitof the Temple<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> of the Palatine Apollo, and, indeed, in most ofthe buildings that were erected by the late Emperor Augustus.At Delos and in the Isle of Lesbos there were formerly somesculptures by their father to be seen. Ambracia too, Argos,and Cleonæ, were filled with productions of the sculptor Dipœnus.</p><p>All these artists, however, used nothing but the white marbleof the Isle of Paros, a stone which was known as "lychnites"at first, because, according to Varro, it was cut in the quarriesby lamplight.<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> Since their time, many other whiter marbleshave been discovered, and very recently that of the quarriesof Luna.<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> With reference to the marble of Paros, there is onevery marvellous circumstance related; in a single block thatwas split with wedges, a figure<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> of Silenus made its appearance.<pb n="6310" /></p><p>We must not omit to remark, that the art of sculpture isof much more ancient<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> date than those of painting and ofstatuary in bronze; both of which commenced with Phidias,in the eighty-third Olympiad, or in other words, aboutthree hundred and thirty-two years later. Indeed, it is said,that Phidias himself worked in marble, and that there is aVenus of his at Rome, a work of extraordinary beauty, in thebuildings of Octavia.<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> A thing, however, that is universallyadmitted, is the fact that he was the instructor of Alcamenes,<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>the Athenian, one of the most famous among the sculptors.By this last artist, there are numerous statues in the templesat Athens; as also, without the walls there, the celebratedVenus, known as the Aphrodite<foreign lang="greek">e)n xh/pois</foreign>,<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> a work to whichPhidias himself, it is said, put the finishing hand. Anotherdisciple also of Phidias was Agoracritus<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> of Paros, a greatfavourite with his master, on account of his extremely youthfulage; and for which reason, it is said, Phidias gave his own nameto many of that artist's works. The two pupils entering into acontest as to the superior execution of a statue of Venus,Alcamenes was successful; not that his work was superior, butbecause his fellow-citizens chose to give their suffrages in hisfavour in preference to a stranger. It was for this reason, itis said, that Agoracritus sold his statue, on the express conditionthat it should never be taken to Athens, and changed itsname to that of Nemesis.<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> It was accordingly erected atRhamnus,<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> a borough of Attica, and M. Varro has consideredit superior to every other statue. There is also to be seen in<pb n="6311" />the Temple of the Great Mother, in the same city, anotherwork<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> by Agoracritus.</p><p>Among all nations which the fame of the Olympian Jupiterhas reached, Phidias is looked upon, beyond all doubt, asthe most famous of artists: but to let those who have nevereven seen his works, know how deservedly he is esteemed,we will take this opportunity of adducing a few slight proofsof the genius which he displayed. In doing this, we shallnot appeal to the beauty of his Olympian Jupiter, nor yet tothe vast proportions of his Athenian Minerva, six and twentycubits in height, and composed of ivory and gold; but it is tothe shield of this last statue that we shall draw attention;upon the convex face of which he has chased a combat of theAmazons, while, upon the concave side of it, he has representedthe battle between the Gods and the Giants. Uponthe sandals again, we see the wars of the Lapithæ andCentaurs, so careful has he been to fill every smallest portionof his work with some proof or other of his artistic skill. Tothe story chased upon the pedestal of the statue, the name ofthe "Birth of Pandora"<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> has been given; and the figuresof new-born<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> gods to be seen upon it are no less than twentyin number. The figure of Victory, in particular, is mostadmirable, and connoisseurs are greatly struck with the serpentand the sphinx in bronze lying beneath the point ofthe spear. Let thus much be said incidentally in reference toan artist who can never be sufficiently praised; if only to letit be understood that the richness of his genius was alwaysequal to itself, even in the very smallest details.</p><p>When speaking<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> of the statuaries, we have already giventhe period at which Praxiteles flourished; an artist, who, inthe glory which he acquired by his works in marble, surpassedeven himself. There are some works of his in theCeramicus<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span> at Athens; but, superior to all the statues, notonly of Praxiteles, but of any other artist that ever existed,is his Cnidian Venus; for the inspection of which, many personsbefore now have purposely undertaken a voyage to<pb n="6312" />Cnidos. The artist made two statues of the goddess, andoffered them both for sale: one of them was representedwith drapery,<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span> and for this reason was preferred<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span> by the peopleof Cos, who had the choice; the second was offered them atthe same price, but, on the grounds of propriety and modesty,they thought fit to choose the other. Upon this, the Cnidianspurchased the rejected statue,<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span> and immensely superior has italways been held in general estimation. At a later period,King Nicomedes wished to purchase this statue of the Cnidians,and made them an offer to pay off the whole of theirpublic debt, which was very large. They preferred, however,to submit to any extremity rather than part with it; and withgood reason, for by this statue Praxiteles has perpetuated theglory of Cnidos. The little temple in which it, is placed isopen on all sides, so that the beauties<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span> of the statue admit of<pb n="6313" />being seen from every point of view; an arrangement whichwas favoured by the goddess herself, it is generally believed.Indeed, from whatever point it is viewed, its execution isequally worthy of admiration. A certain individual, it issaid, became enamoured of this statue, and, concealing himselfin the temple during the night, gratified his lustful passionupon it, traces of which are to be seen in a stain left uponthe marble.<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span></p><p>There are also at Cnidos some other statues in marble, theproductions of illustrious artists; a Father Liber<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span> by Bryaxis,<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span>another by Scopas,<span id="ref_31"><a href="#note_31">[31]</a></span> and a Minerva by the same hand: indeed,there is no greater proof of the supreme excellence of theVenus of Praxiteles than the fact that, amid such productionsas these, it is the only one that we generally find noticed.By Praxiteles, too, there is a Cupid, a statue which occasioned<span id="ref_32"><a href="#note_32">[32]</a></span>one of the charges brought by Cicero against Verres,and for the sake of seeing which persons used to visit Thespiæ:at the present day, it is to be seen in the Schools<span id="ref_33"><a href="#note_33">[33]</a></span> of Octavia.By the same artist there is also another Cupid, withoutdrapery, at Parium, a colony of the Propontis; equal to theCnidian Venus in the fineness of its execution, and said to havebeen the object of a similar outrage. For one Alcetas, aRhodian, becoming deeply enamoured of it, left upon themarble similar traces of the violence of his passion.</p><p>At Rome there are, by Praxiteles, a Flora, a Triptolemus,and a Ceres, in the Gardens of Servilius; statues of GoodSuccess<span id="ref_34"><a href="#note_34">[34]</a></span> and Good Fortune, in the Capitol; as also someMænades,<span id="ref_35"><a href="#note_35">[35]</a></span> and figures known as Thyiades<span id="ref_36"><a href="#note_36">[36]</a></span> and Caryatides;<span id="ref_37"><a href="#note_37">[37]</a></span><pb n="6314" />some Sileni,<span id="ref_38"><a href="#note_38">[38]</a></span> to be seen in the memorial buildings of AsiniusPollio, and statues of Apollo and Neptune.</p><p>Cephisodotus,<span id="ref_39"><a href="#note_39">[39]</a></span> the son of Praxiteles, inherited his father'stalent. There is, by him, at Pergamus, a splendid Group<span id="ref_40"><a href="#note_40">[40]</a></span> ofWrestlers, a work that has been highly praised, and in whichthe fingers have all the appearance of being impressed uponreal flesh rather than upon marble. At Rome there are byhim, a Latona, in the Temple of the Palatium; a Venus, in thebuildings that are memorials of Asinius Pollio; and an Æsculapius,and a Diana, in the Temple of Juno situate withinthe Porticos of Octavia.</p><p>Scopas<span id="ref_41"><a href="#note_41">[41]</a></span> rivals these artists in fame: there are by him, aVenus<span id="ref_42"><a href="#note_42">[42]</a></span> and a Pothos,<span id="ref_43"><a href="#note_43">[43]</a></span> statues which are venerated at Samothracewith the most august ceremonials. He was also thesculptor of the Palatine Apollo; a Vesta seated, in the Gardensof Servilius, and represented with two Bends<span id="ref_44"><a href="#note_44">[44]</a></span> around her, awork that has been highly praised; two similar Bends, to beseen upon the buildings of Asinius Pollio; and some figures ofCanephori<span id="ref_45"><a href="#note_45">[45]</a></span> in the same place. But the most highly esteemedof all his works, are those in the Temple erected by CneiusDomitius,<span id="ref_46"><a href="#note_46">[46]</a></span> in the Flaminian Circus; a figure of Neptunehimself, a Thetis and Achilles, Nereids seated upon dolphins,cetaceous fishes, and<span id="ref_47"><a href="#note_47">[47]</a></span> sea-horses,<span id="ref_48"><a href="#note_48">[48]</a></span> Tritons, the train of Phor-<pb n="6315" />cus,<span id="ref_49"><a href="#note_49">[49]</a></span> whales,<span id="ref_50"><a href="#note_50">[50]</a></span> and numerous other sea-monsters, all by thesame hand; an admirable piece of workmanship, even if it hadtaken a whole life to complete it. In addition to the worksby him already mentioned, and others of the existence ofwhich we are ignorant, there is still to be seen a colossal Marsof his, seated, in the Temple erected by Brutus Callæcus,<span id="ref_51"><a href="#note_51">[51]</a></span>also in the Flaminian Circus; as also, a naked Venus, of anteriordate to that by Praxiteles, and a production that wouldbe quite sufficient to establish the renown of any other place.</p><p>At Rome, it is true, it is quite lost sight of amid such a vastmultitude of similar works of art: and then besides, the inattentionto these matters that is induced by such vast numbersof duties and so many items of business, quite precludes thegenerality of persons from devoting their thoughts to thesubject. For, in fact, the admiration that is due to this art,not only demands an abundance of leisure, but requires thatprofound silence should reign upon the spot. Hence it is,that the artist is now forgotten, who executed the statue ofVenus that was dedicated by the Emperor Vespasianus in hisTemple of Peace, a work well worthy of the high repute ofancient times. With reference, too, to the Dying Children ofNiobe, in the Temple of the Sosian<span id="ref_52"><a href="#note_52">[52]</a></span> Apollo, there is an equaldegree of uncertainty, whether it is the work<span id="ref_53"><a href="#note_53">[53]</a></span> of Scopas or ofPraxiteles. So, too, as to the Father Janus, a work that wasbrought from Egypt and dedicated in his Temple<span id="ref_54"><a href="#note_54">[54]</a></span> by Augustus,it is a question by which of these two artists<span id="ref_55"><a href="#note_55">[55]</a></span> it was made:at the present day, however, it is quite hidden from us by the<pb n="6316" />quantity of gold that covers it. The same question, too,arises with reference to the Cupid brandishing a Thunderbolt,now to be seen in the Curia of Octavia: the only thing, infact, that is affirmed with any degree of certainty respectingit, is, that it is a likeness of Alcibiades, who was the handsomestman of his day. There are, too, in the Schools<span id="ref_56"><a href="#note_56">[56]</a></span> ofOctavia, many other highly attractive works, the authors ofwhich are now unknown: four Satyrs, for example, one ofwhich carries in his arms a Father Liber, robed in the palla;<span id="ref_57"><a href="#note_57">[57]</a></span>another similarly supports the Goddess Libera;<span id="ref_58"><a href="#note_58">[58]</a></span> a third ispacifying a child who is crying; and a fourth is giving a childsome water to drink, from a cup; two Zephyrs also, whoagitate their flowing drapery with their breath. No less isthe uncertainty that prevails as to the authors of the statuesnow to be seen in the Septa;<span id="ref_59"><a href="#note_59">[59]</a></span> an Olympus<span id="ref_60"><a href="#note_60">[60]</a></span> and Pan, and aCharon and Achilles;<span id="ref_61"><a href="#note_61">[61]</a></span> and yet their high reputation hascaused them to be deemed valuable enough for their keepersto be made answerable for their safety at the cost of their lives.</p><p>Scopas had for rivals and contemporaries, Bryaxis,<span id="ref_62"><a href="#note_62">[62]</a></span> Timotheus,<span id="ref_63"><a href="#note_63">[63]</a></span>and Leochares,<span id="ref_64"><a href="#note_64">[64]</a></span> artists whom we are bound to mention together, from the fact that they worked together at theMausoleum; such being the name of the tomb that waserected by his wife Artemisia in honour of Mausolus, a pettyking of Caria, who died in the second year of the hundred andseventh Olympiad. It was through the exertions of theseartists more particularly, that this work came to be reckonedone of the Seven Wonders of the World.<span id="ref_65"><a href="#note_65">[65]</a></span> The circumference<span id="ref_66"><a href="#note_66">[66]</a></span>of this building is, in all, four hundred and forty feet,<pb n="6317" />and the breadth from north to south sixty-three, the twofronts<span id="ref_67"><a href="#note_67">[67]</a></span> being not so wide in extent. It is twenty-five cubitsin height, and is surrounded with six-and-thirty columns,the outer circumference being known as the "Pteron."<span id="ref_68"><a href="#note_68">[68]</a></span> Theeast side was sculptured by Scopas, the north by Bryaxis, thesouth by Timotheus, and the west by Leochares; but, beforetheir task was completed, Queen Artemisia died.<span id="ref_69"><a href="#note_69">[69]</a></span> They didnot leave their work, however, until it was finished, consideringthat it was at once a memorial of their own fame and ofthe sculptor's art: and, to this day even, it is undecided whichof them has excelled. A fifth artist also took part in thework; for above the Pteron there is a pyramid erected, equalin height to the building below, and formed of four andtwenty steps, which gradually taper upwards towards thesummit; a platform, crowned with a representation of a four-horsechariot by Pythis. This addition makes the total heightof the work one hundred and forty feet.<span id="ref_70"><a href="#note_70">[70]</a></span></p><p>There is at Rome, by Timotheus, a Diana, in the Temple ofApollo in the Palatium, the head of which has been replacedby Avianius Evander.<span id="ref_71"><a href="#note_71">[71]</a></span> A Hercules, too, by Menestratus,<span id="ref_72"><a href="#note_72">[72]</a></span> isgreatly admired; and there is a Hecate of his at Ephesus, in<pb n="6318" />the Temple of Diana there, behind the sanctuary. The keepersof the temple recommend persons, when viewing it, to becareful of their eyes, so remarkably radiant is the marble.No less esteemed, too, are the statues of the Graces,<span id="ref_73"><a href="#note_73">[73]</a></span> in thePropylæum<span id="ref_74"><a href="#note_74">[74]</a></span> at Athens; the workmanship of Socrates thesculptor, a different person from the painter<span id="ref_75"><a href="#note_75">[75]</a></span> of that name,though identical with him in the opinion of some. As toMyron,<span id="ref_76"><a href="#note_76">[76]</a></span> who is so highly praised for his works in bronze,there is by him at Smyrna, An Old Woman Intoxicated, awork that is held in high estimation.</p><p>Asinius Pollio, a man of a warm and ardent temperament,was determined that the buildings which he erected as memorialsof himself should be made as attractive as possible; forhere we see groups representing, Nymphs carried off by Centaurs,a work of Arcesilas:<span id="ref_77"><a href="#note_77">[77]</a></span> the Thespiades,<span id="ref_78"><a href="#note_78">[78]</a></span> by Cleomenes:<span id="ref_79"><a href="#note_79">[79]</a></span> Oceanusand Jupiter, by Heniochus:<span id="ref_80"><a href="#note_80">[80]</a></span> the Appiades,<span id="ref_81"><a href="#note_81">[81]</a></span> by Stephanus:<span id="ref_82"><a href="#note_82">[82]</a></span>Hermerotes,<span id="ref_83"><a href="#note_83">[83]</a></span> by Tauriscus, not the chaser in silver, already<span id="ref_84"><a href="#note_84">[84]</a></span>mentioned, but a native of Tralles:<span id="ref_85"><a href="#note_85">[85]</a></span> a Jupiter Hospitalis<span id="ref_86"><a href="#note_86">[86]</a></span> by Papylus,a pupil of Praxiteles: Zethus and Amphion, with Dirce,the Bull,<span id="ref_87"><a href="#note_87">[87]</a></span> and the halter, all sculptured from a single block of<pb n="6319" />marble, the work of Apollonius and Tauriscus, and brought toRome from Rhodes. These two artists made it a sort of rivalryas to their parentage, for they declared that, although Apollodoruswas their natural progenitor, Menecrates<span id="ref_88"><a href="#note_88">[88]</a></span> would appear to havebeen their father. In the same place, too, there is a FatherLiber,<span id="ref_89"><a href="#note_89">[89]</a></span> by Eutychides,<span id="ref_90"><a href="#note_90">[90]</a></span> highly praised. Near the Portico of Octavia,there is an Apollo, by Philiscus<span id="ref_91"><a href="#note_91">[91]</a></span> of Rhodes, placed in theTemple of that God; a Latona and Diana also; the Nine Muses;and another Apollo, without drapery. The Apollo holding theLyre, in the same temple, was executed by Timarchides.<span id="ref_92"><a href="#note_92">[92]</a></span> Inthe Temple of Juno, within the Porticos of Octavia, there isa figure of that goddess, executed by Dionysius,<span id="ref_93"><a href="#note_93">[93]</a></span> and anotherby Polycles,<span id="ref_94"><a href="#note_94">[94]</a></span> as also other statues by Praxiteles.<span id="ref_95"><a href="#note_95">[95]</a></span> This Polycles,too, in conjunction with Dionysius,<span id="ref_96"><a href="#note_96">[96]</a></span> the son of Timarchides,made the statue of Jupiter, which is to be seen in theadjoining temple.<span id="ref_97"><a href="#note_97">[97]</a></span> The figures of Pan and Olympus Wrestling,in the same place, are by Heliodorus;<span id="ref_98"><a href="#note_98">[98]</a></span> and they are consideredto be the next finest group<span id="ref_99"><a href="#note_99">[99]</a></span> of this nature in all the world. Thesame artist also executed a Venus at the Bath, and Polycharmusanother Venus, in an erect<span id="ref_100"><a href="#note_100">[100]</a></span> posture.</p><p>By the honourable place which the work of Lysias occupies,we may see in what high esteem it was held by the late EmperorAugustus, who consecrated it in honour of his fatherOctavius, in the Palatium, placing it on an arch within a small<pb n="6320" />temple, adorned with columns: it is the figure of a four-horsechariot, with an Apollo and Diana, all sculptured from a singleblock. I find it stated, also, that the Apollo by Calamis, thechaser already<span id="ref_101"><a href="#note_101">[101]</a></span> mentioned, the Pugilists by Dercylides, andthe statue of Callisthenes the historian, by Amphistratus,<span id="ref_102"><a href="#note_102">[102]</a></span> allof them now in the Gardens of Servilius, are works highlyesteemed.</p><p>Beyond these, there are not many sculptors of high repute;for, in the case of several works of very great excellence,the number of artists that have been engaged upon them hasproved a considerable obstacle to the fame of each, no individualbeing able to engross the whole of the credit, and it beingimpossible to award it in due proportion to the names of theseveral artists combined. Such is the case with the Laocoön,for example, in the palace of the Emperor Titus, a work thatmay be looked upon as preferable to any other production ofthe art of painting or of statuary. It is sculptured from a singleblock, both the main figure as well as the children, and the serpents with their marvellous folds. This group was made in concert by three most eminent artists,<span id="ref_103"><a href="#note_103">[103]</a></span> Agesander, Polydorus, andAthenodorus, natives of Rhodes. In similar manner also, thepalaces of the Cæsars, in the Palatium, have been filled withmost splendid statuary, the work of Craterus, in conjunction<pb n="6321" />with Pythodorus, of Polydeuces with Hermoläus, and of anotherPythodorus with Artemon; some of the statues, also, are byAphrodisius of Tralles, who worked alone. The Pantheon ofAgrippa has been decorated by Diogenes of Athens, and theCaryatides, by him, which form the columns of that temple, arelooked upon as master-pieces of excellence: the same, too,with the statues that are placed upon the roof, though, inconsequence of the height, they have not had an opportunityof being so well appreciated.</p><p>Without glory, and excluded from every temple, is thestatue of Hercules,<span id="ref_104"><a href="#note_104">[104]</a></span> in honour of whom the Carthaginianswere accustomed to sacrifice human victims every year: itstands upon the ground before the entrance of the Portico ofthe Nations.<span id="ref_105"><a href="#note_105">[105]</a></span> There were erected, too, near the Temple ofFelicity, the statues of the Thespian<span id="ref_106"><a href="#note_106">[106]</a></span> Muses; of one of which,according to Varro, Junius Pisciculus, a Roman of equestrianrank, became enamoured. Pasiteles,<span id="ref_107"><a href="#note_107">[107]</a></span> too, speaks in terms ofhigh admiration of them, the artist who wrote five Books onthe most celebrated works throughout the world. Born uponthe Grecian<span id="ref_108"><a href="#note_108">[108]</a></span> shores of Italy, and presented with the Romancitizenship granted to the cities of those parts, Pasiteles constructedthe ivory statue of Jupiter which is now in the Templeof Metellus,<span id="ref_109"><a href="#note_109">[109]</a></span> on the road to the Campus Martius. It so happened,that being one day at the Docks,<span id="ref_110"><a href="#note_110">[110]</a></span> where there weresome wild beasts from Africa, while he was viewing throughthe bars of a cage a lion which he was engaged in drawing, apanther made its escape from another cage, to the no smalldanger of this most careful artist.

Some are of opinion that these artists werevery wealthy men, and that they erected these buildings attheir own expense, expecting to be allowed to inscribe theirnames thereon; but that, this indulgence being refused them,they adopted another method of attaining their object. Atall events, there are still to be seen, at the present day, on thespirals<span id="ref_116"><a href="#note_116">[116]</a></span> of the columns, the figures of a lizard and a frog,<span id="ref_117"><a href="#note_117">[117]</a></span>emblematical of their names. In the Temple of Jupiter bythe same artists, the paintings, as well as all the other ornaments,bear reference to the worship of a goddess. The<span id="ref_118"><a href="#note_118">[118]</a></span> factis, that when the temple of Juno was completed, the porters, asit is said, who were entrusted with the carriage of the statues,made an exchange of them; and, on religious grounds, themistake was left uncorrected, from an impression that it hadbeen by the intervention of the divinities themselves, thatthis seat of worship had been thus shared between them.Hence it is that we see in the Temple of Juno, also, the ornamentswhich properly pertain to the worship of Jupiter.<pb n="6323" /></p><p>Some minute works in marble have also gained reputation fortheir artists: by Myrmecides,<span id="ref_119"><a href="#note_119">[119]</a></span> there was a four-horse chariot,so small that it could be covered, driver and all, by the wingsof a fly; and by Callicrates,<span id="ref_120"><a href="#note_120">[120]</a></span> some ants, in marble, the feetand other limbs of which were so fine as to escape the sight.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">These two artists are invariably mentioned together.

The artist modelled it from Phryne, a courtesan or hetæra ofAthens, of whom he was greatly enamoured. It was ultimately carriedto Constantinople, where it perished by fire in the reign of Justinian. Itis doubtful whether there are any copies of it in existence. There is,however, a so-called copy in the gardens of the Vatican, and another inthe Glyptothek, at Munich. A Venus in the Museo Pio-Clementino, atRome, is considered by Visconti and others to have been a copy of theCnidian Venus, with the addition of drapery.

Secondly, that there was a screen of36 columns surrounding the main building, and 411 feet in circumference.(He adopts this reading in preference to the 440 feet of the Bamberg MS.)That the longer sides of this screen were 113.25 feet in extent, and theshorter 92.125 feet. That between the main building and this screen, orcolonnade, there was an interval of 25.125 feet. Thirdly, that the colonnadeand the main buildings were united by a vaulted roof, and that thisunion formed the "Pteron." Fourthly, that rising from this Pteron,there was a quadrangular truncated pyramid, formed of twenty-four steps,and surmounted with a chariot of marble. This would allow, speaking inround numbers, 37 1/2 feet for the height of the main body of the building,37 1/2 feet for the pyramid, and twenty-five feet for the height of the chariotand the figure which it doubtless contained.</p><p><span id="note_71"><a href="#ref_71">71. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Supposed to be the person alluded to by Horace, 1 Sat. 3, 90.</p><p><span id="note_72"><a href="#ref_72">72. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He is mentioned also by Tatian, and is supposed to have lived aboutthe time of Alexander the Great.</p><p><span id="note_73"><a href="#ref_73">73. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Charites."</p><p><span id="note_74"><a href="#ref_74">74. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Porch," or "Vestibule" of the Citadel at Athens.</p><p><span id="note_75"><a href="#ref_75">75. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Mentioned in B. xxxv. c. 40.

This group isgenerally supposed to have been identical with the Laocoön still to be seenin the Court of the Belvedere, in the Vatican at Rome; having beenfound, in <date value="1506" authname="1506">1506</date>, in a vault beneath the spot known as the Place <hi rend="ital">de SetteSale,</hi> by Felix de Fredi, who surrendered it, in consideration of a pension,to Pope Julius II. The group, however, is not made of a <hi rend="ital">single</hi> block,which has caused some to doubt its identity: but it is not improbable, thatwhen originally made, its joints were not perceptible to a common observer. The spot, too, where it was found was actually part of the palaceof Titus. It is most probable that the artists had the beautiful episodeof Laocoön in view, as penned by Virgil, Æn. B. II.; though Ajassondoubts whether they derived any inspiration from it. Laocoön, in thesublime expression of his countenance, is doing any thing, he says, but—<lb />"Clamores simul horrendos ad sidera tollit."<lb />"Sending dire outcries to the stars of heaven."</p><p><span id="note_104"><a href="#ref_104">104. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This was an ancient and hideous idol, probably.
