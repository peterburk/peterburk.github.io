<div2 type="chapter" n="1" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAPS. 1 &amp; 2. (1.)—THE NATURE OF THE VINE. ITS MODE OFFRUCTIFICATION.</head><p>Those which have been hitherto mentioned, are, nearly allof them, exotic trees, which it is impossible to rear in anyother than their native soil, and which are not to be naturalizedin strange countries.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> It is now for us to speak of the moreordinary kinds, of all of which Italy may be looked uponas more particularly the parent.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> Those who are well acquainted with the subject, must only bear in mind that forthe present we content ourselves with merely stating thedifferent varieties of these trees, and not the mode of cultivatingthem, although there is no doubt that the characteristics of atree depend very considerably upon its cultivation. At thisfact I cannot sufficiently express my astonishment, that ofsome trees all memory has utterly perished, and that thevery names of some, of which we find various authors makingmention, have wholly disappeared.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> And yet who does notreadily admit that now, when intercommunications have beenopened between all parts of the world, thanks to the majesticsway of the Roman empire, civilization and the arts of lifehave made a rapid progress, owing to the interchange of commodities and the common enjoyment by all of the blessings ofpeace, while at the same time a multitude of objects which<pb n="3216" />formerly lay concealed, are now revealed for our indiscriminateuse?</p><p>Still, by Hercules! at the present day there are none to befound who have any acquaintance with much that has beenhanded down to us by the ancient writers; so much morecomprehensive was the diligent research of our forefathers, orelse so much more happily employed was their industry. Itis a thousand years ago since Hesiod,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> at the very dawn, so tosay, of literature, first gave precepts for the guidance of theagriculturist, an example which has since been followed by nosmall number of writers. Hence have originated considerablelabours for ourselves, seeing that we have not only to enquireinto the discoveries of modern times, but to ascertain as wellwhat was known to the ancients, and this, too, in the verymidst of that oblivion which the heedlessness of the presentday has so greatly tended to generate. What causes then arewe to assign for this lethargy, other than those Feelings whichwe find actuating the public in general throughout all theworld? New manners and usages, no doubt, have now comeinto vogue, and the minds of men are occupied with subjectsof a totally different nature; the arts of avarice, in fact, arethe only ones that are now cultivated.</p><p>In days gone by, the sway and the destinies of states werebounded by their own narrow limits, and consequently thegenius of the people was similarly circumscribed as well,through a sort of niggardliness that was thus displayed byFortune: hence it became with them a matter of absolutenecessity to employ the advantages of the understanding:kings innumerable received the homage of the arts, and inmaking a display of the extent of their resources, gave thehighest rank to those arts, entertaining the opinion that it wasthrough them that they should ensure immortality. Hence itwas that due rewards, and the various works of civilization, weredisplayed in such vast abundance in those times. For theselater ages, the enlarged boundaries of the habitable world,and the vast extent of our empire, have been a positive injury.Since the Censor has been chosen for the extent of his property,since the judge has been selected according to the magnitude ofhis fortune, since it has become the fashion to consider that<pb n="3217" />nothing reflects a higher merit upon the magistrate and thegeneral than a large estate, since the being destitute of heirs<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>has begun to confer upon persons the very highest power andinfluence, since legacy-hunting<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> has become the most lucrativeof all professions, and since it has been considered that theonly real pleasures are those of possessing, all the true enjoyments of life have been utterly lost sight of, and all those artswhich have derived the name of liberal, from liberty,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> thatgreatest blessing of life, have come to deserve the contraryappellation, servility alone being the passport to profit.</p><p>This servility each one has his own peculiar way of makingmost agreeable, and of putting in practice in reference toothers, the motives and the hopes of all tending to the onegreat object, the acquisition of wealth: indeed, we may everywhere behold men even of naturally excellent qualities preferring to foster the vicious inclinations of others rather thancultivate their own talents. We may therefore conclude, byHercules! that pleasure has now begun to live, and that life,truly so called, has ceased to be.<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> As to ourselves, however,we shall continue our researches into matters now lost in oblivion, nor shall we be deterred from pursuing our task by thetrivial nature<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> of some of our details, a consideration whichhas in no way influenced us in our description of the animalworld. And yet we find that Virgil, that most admirablepoet, has allowed this to influence him, in his omission to enlargeupon the beauties of the garden; for, happy and graceful poetas he is, he has only culled what we may call the flower ofhis subject: indeed, we find that he has only named<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> in allsome fifteen varieties of the grape, three of the olive, the samenumber of the pear, and the citron of Assyria, and has passedover the rest in silence altogether.</p><p>(2). With what then ought we to begin in preference to thevine, the superiority in which has been so peculiarly con-<pb n="3218" />ceded to Italy, that in this one blessing we may pronounce herto have surpassed those of all other nations of the earth, withthe sole exception of those that bear the various perfumes?and even there, when the vine is in flower, there is not a perfume known which in exquisite sweetness can surpass it.The vine has been justly reckoned<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> by the ancients among thetrees, on account of its remarkable size. In the city of Populonium, we see a statue of Jupiter formed of the trunk of asingle vine, which has for ages remained proof against alldecay; and at Massilia, there is a patera made of the samewood. At Metapontum, the temple of Juno has long stoodsupported by pillars formed of the like material; and even atthe present day we ascend to the roof of the temple of Diana atEphesus, by stairs constructed, it is said, of the trunk of a singlevine, that was brought from Cyprus; the vines of that islandoften attaining a most remarkable size. There is not a wood inexistence of a more lasting nature than this; I am stronglyinclined, however, to be of opinion that the material of whichthese various articles were constructed was the wild vine.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This must be understood with considerable modification—many ofthe tropical trees and plants have been naturalized, and those of Americamore particularly, in Europe.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He is probably wrong in looking upon the vine as indigenous to Italy.It was known in very early times in Egypt and Greece, and it is nowgenerally considered that it is indigenous throughout the tract thatstretches to the south, from the the mountains of Mazandiran on the Caspian to the shores of the Persian Gulf and the Indian Sea, and eastwardthrough Khorassan and Cabul to the base of the Himalayas.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The art of printing, Fée remarks, utterly precludes the recurrence ofsuch a fact as this.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In allusion to his poem, the "Works and Days," the prototype ofVirgil's Georgics.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He alludes to the legacy-hunters with which Rome abounded in histime.
