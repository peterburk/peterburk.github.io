He states,also, that in his own time, it was already found in Spain, butof a harsh and sandy nature; as also in Colchis, upon a certaininaccessible rock there, from which it was brought downby the agency of darts. This, however, he says, was only anadulterated kind of minium, the best of all being that procuredin the Cilbian Plains,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> above Ephesus, the sand of whichhas just the colour of the kermes berry.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> This sand, he informsus, is first ground to powder and then washed, theportion that settles at the bottom being subjected to a secondwashing. From this circumstance, he says, arises a differencein the article; some persons being in the habit of preparingtheir minium with a single washing, while with others it ismore diluted. The best kind, however, he says, is that whichhas undergone a second washing.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. v. c. 31.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xvi. c. 12, and B. xxiv. c. 4.</p></body>
