Their density and their substance isvery clearly proved from their intercepting the sun's rays,which are visible by divers, even in the deepest waters<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The doctrine of Aristotle on the nature and formation of mists andclouds is contained in his treatises De Meteor. lib. i. cap. 9. p. 540, andDe Mundo, cap. 4. p. 605.
