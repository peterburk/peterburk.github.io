(12.)—THE SAGACITY OF THESE ANIMALS.</head><p>The sagacity which every animal exhibits in its own behalfis wonderful, but in these it is remarkably so. The dragonhas much difficulty in climbing up to so great a height, andtherefore, watching the road, which bears marks of their footsteps when going to feed, it darts down upon them from alofty tree. The elephant knows that it is quite unable tostruggle against the folds of the serpent, and so seeks for treesor rocks against which to rub itself. The dragon is on itsguard against this, and tries to prevent it, by first of all confining the legs of the elephant with the folds of its tail; whilethe elephant, on the other hand, endeavours to disengage itselfwith its trunk. The dragon, however, thrusts its head intoits nostrils, and thus, at the same moment, stops the breath andwounds the most tender parts. When it is met unexpectedly,the dragon raises itself up, faces its opponent, and flies moreespecially at the eyes; this is the reason why elephants are sooften found blind, and worn to a skeleton with hunger andmisery. What other cause can one assign for such mightystrifes as these, except that Nature is desirous, as it were, tomake an exhibition for herself, in pitting such opponentsagainst each other?</p><p>There is another story, too, told in relation to these combats—the blood of the elephant, it is said, is remarkably cold; forwhich reason, in the parching heats of summer,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> it is soughtby the dragon with remarkable avidity. It lies, therefore, coiledup and concealed in the rivers, in wait for the elephants, whenthey come to drink; upon which it darts out, fastens itselfaround the trunk, and then fixes its teeth behind the ear, thatbeing the only place which the elephant cannot protect withthe trunk. The dragons, it is said, are of such vast size, thatthey can swallow the whole of the blood; consequently, theelephant, being thus drained of its blood, falls to the earthexhausted; while the dragon, intoxicated with the draught,is crushed beneath it, and so shares its fate.<pb n="2261" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The idea of the elephant's blood being cold, and sought after by thedragon, is, of course, without foundation; its blood being of the same temperature with that of other quadrupeds.—B.</p></body>
