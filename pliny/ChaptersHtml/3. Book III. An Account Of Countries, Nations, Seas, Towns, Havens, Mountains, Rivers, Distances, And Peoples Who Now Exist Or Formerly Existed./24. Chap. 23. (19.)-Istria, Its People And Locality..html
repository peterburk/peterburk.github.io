<div2 type="chapter" n="23" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 23. (19.)—ISTRIA, ITS PEOPLE AND LOCALITY.</head><p>Istria projects in the form of a peninsula. Some writershave stated its length to be forty miles, and its circumference125; and the same as to Liburnia which adjoins it, and theFlanatic Gulf<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>, while others make it 225<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>; others againmake the circumference of Liburnia 180 miles. Some persons too extend Iapydia, at the back of Istria, as far as theFlanatic Gulf, a distance of 130 miles, thus making Liburniabut 150 miles. Tuditanus<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>, who subdued the Istri, had thisinscription on his statue which was erected there: "FromAquileia to the river Titus is a distance of 1000 stadia."</p><p>The towns of Istria with the rights of Roman citizens areÆgida<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, Parentium, and the colony of Pola<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>, now Pietas Julia,formerly founded by the Colchians, and distant from Tergeste 100 miles: after which we come to the town of Nesactium<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>, and the river Arsia, now<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> the boundary of Italy.The distance across from Ancona to Pola is 120 miles. In<pb n="1252" />the interior of the tenth region are the colonies of Cremona,Brixia in the territory of the Cenomanni<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>, Ateste<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> belongingto the Veneti, and the towns of Acelum<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>, Patavium<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>, Opitergium,Belunum<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>, and Vicetia; with Mantua<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>, the onlycity of the Tuscans now left beyond the Padus. Cato informs us thatthe Veneti are descendants of the Trojans<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>,and that the Cenomanni<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> dwelt among the Volcæ in the vicinity ofMassilia. There are also the towns of the Fertini<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span>,the Tridentini<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span>, and the Beruenses, belonging to the Rhæti,Verona<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span>, belonging to the Rhæti and the Euganei, and Ju-<pb n="1253" />lienses<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> to the Carni. We then have the following peoples,whom there is no necessity to particularize with any degreeof exactness, the Alutrenses, the Asseriates, the Flamonienses<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> withthose surnamed Vanienses, and the otherscalled Culici, the Forojulienses<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> surnamed Transpadani, theForetani, the Nedinates<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span>, the Quarqueni<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span>, the Taurisani<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span>,the Togienses, and the Varvari. In this district there havedisappeared—upon the coast—Iramene, Pellaon, and Palsatium, Atina andCælina belonging to the Veneti, Segesteand Ocra to the Carni, and Noreia to the Taurisci. L. Pisoalso informs us that although the senate disapproved of hisso doing, M. Claudius Marcellus<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span> razed to the ground atower situate at the twelfth mile-stone from Aquileia.</p><p>In this region also and the eleventh there are some celebratedlakes<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span>, and several rivers that either take their rise inthem or else are fed by their waters, in those cases in whichthey again emerge from them. These are the Addua<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span>, fed bythe Lake Larius, the Ticinus by Lake Verbannus, the Minciusby Lake Benacus, the Ollius by Lake Sebinnus, and the Lambrus by LakeEupilis—all of them flowing into the Padus.<pb n="1254" /></p><p>Cælius states that the length of the Alps from the UpperSea to the Lower is 1000 miles, a distance which Timagenes shortensby twenty-two. Cornelius Nepos assigns tothem a breadth of 100 miles, and T. Livius of 3000 stadia;but then in different places. For in some localities theyexceed 100 miles; where they divide Germany, for instance,from Italy; while in other parts they do not reach seventy,being thus narrowed by the providential dispensation ofnature as it were. The breadth of Italy, taken from theriver Var at the foot of these mountains, and passing alongby the Vada<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span> Sabatia, the Taurini, Comum, Brixia, Verona,Vicetia, Opitergium, Aquileia, Tergeste, Pola, and Arsia, is745 miles.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now the Golfo di Quarnaro. Liburnia was separated from Istria on the north-west by the river Arsia, and from Dalnatia on the south by the river Titus or Kerka, corresponding to the western part of modern Croatia, and the northern part of modern Dalmatia. Iapydia was situate to the north of Dalmatia and east of Liburnia, or the present military frontier of Croatia, between the rivers Kulpa and Korana to the north and east, and the Velebich mountains to the south. Istria consisted of the peninsula which still bears the same appellation.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This passage, "while others make it 225," is omitted in many of the MSS. and most of the editions. If it is retained, it is not improbable that his meaning is, "and the circumference of Liburnia which joins it, with the Flanatic Gulf, some make 225, while others make the compass of Liburnia to be 180 miles." It depends on the punctuation and the force of "item," and the question whether the passage is not in a corrupt state; and it is not at all clear what his meaning really is.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He alludes to C.

A Roman colony being established there itbecame a powerful city. It was destroyed by Antonius the general ofVespasian, and again by the Lombard king Agilulfus in A.D. <date value="605" authname="605">605</date>.

Under theRomans it was the most important city in the north of Italy, and by itscommerce and manufactures attained great opulence. It was plunderedby Attila, and, by Agilulfus, king of the Lombards, was razed to theground. It was celebrated as being the birth-place of Livy. ModernPadua stands on its site, but has no remains of antiquity.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called Belluno.

It was said to have had itsname from Manto, the daughter of Tiresias.

From Polybius and Livy we learn that theyhad crossed the Alps within historical memory, and had expelled theEtruscans and occupied their territory. They were signalized for theiramicable feelings towards the Roman state.</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Their town was Fertria or Feltria, the modern Feltre.</p><p><span id="note_17"><a href="#ref_17">17. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The modern city of Trento or Trent occupies the site of Tridentum,their town.
