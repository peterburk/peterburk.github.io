<div2 type="chapter" n="100" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 100.—WHERE THE TIDES RISE AND FALL IN ANUNUSUAL MANNER.</head><p>There are, however, some tides which are of a peculiarnature, as in the Tauromenian Euripus<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>, where the ebb andflow is more frequent than in other places, and in Eubœa,where it takes place seven times during the day and thenight. The tides intermit three times during each month,being the 7th, 8th and 9th day of the moon<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>. At Gades,which is very near the temple of Hercules, there is a spring<pb n="1128" />enclosed like a well, which sometimes rises and falls with theocean, and, at other times, in both respects contrary to it.In the same place there is another well, which always agreeswith the ocean. On the shores of the Bætis<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>, there is a townwhere the wells become lower when the tide rises, and fillagain when it ebbs; while at other times they remain stationary. Thesame thing occurs in one well in the town ofHispalis<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, while there is nothing peculiar in the other wells.The Euxine always flows into the Propontis, the waternever flowing back into the Euxine<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The name of Euripus is generally applied to the strait betweenBœotia and Eubœa, but our author here extends it to that between Italyand Sicily. A peculiarity in the tide of this strait is referred to byCicero, De Nat. Deor. iii. 24.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Estus idem triduo in mense consistit." "Consistentia, sive mediocritas aquarum non solum septima die sentitur, sed et octava, ac nonadurat," as Hardoum explains this passage, Lemaire, i. 431.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called the Guadalquivir.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The modern Seville.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This circumstance is noticed by most of the ancients, as by Aristotle,Meteor. ii. 1; by Seneca, Nat. Quæst. iv. 2; and by Strabo. It has,however, no relation to the tide, but depends upon the quantity of watertransmitted into the Euxine by the numerous large rivers that emptythemselves into it.</p></body>
