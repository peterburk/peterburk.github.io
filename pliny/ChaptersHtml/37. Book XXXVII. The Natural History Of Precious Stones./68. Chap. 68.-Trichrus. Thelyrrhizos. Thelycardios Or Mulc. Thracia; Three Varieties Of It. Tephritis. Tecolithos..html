TECOLITHOS.</head><p>Trichrus<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> comes from Africa: it is of a black colour, butyields three different liquids, black at the lower part, blood-redin the middle, and of an ochre colour at the top. Thelyrrhizos<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>is of an ashy or russet colour, but white at the lowerpart. Thelycardios<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> is like a heart in colour, and is held inhigh esteem by the people of Persia, in which country it isfound: the name given to it by them is "mule." Of thracia<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>there are three varieties; a green stone, one of a more pallidcolour, and a third with spots like drops of blood. Tephritis<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>is crescent-shaped, with horns like those of the new moon, butit is of an ashy colour. Tecolithos<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> has all the appearance ofan olive stone: it is held in no estimation as a gem, but asolution of it will break and expel urinary calculi.<pb n="6458" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Three-coloured stone.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Meaning "Female heart," apparently.
