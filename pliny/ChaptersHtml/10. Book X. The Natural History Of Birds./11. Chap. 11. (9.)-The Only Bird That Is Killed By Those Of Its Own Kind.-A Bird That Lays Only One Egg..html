(9.)ÑTHE ONLY BIRD THAT IS KILLED BY THOSE OFITS OWN KIND.ÑA BIRD THAT LAYS ONLY ONE EGG.</head><p>The cuckoo seems to be but another form of the hawk,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>which at a certain season of the year changes its shape; itbeing the fact that during this period no other hawks are to beseen, except, perhaps, for a few days only; the cuckoo, too,itself is only seen for a short period in the summer, and doesnot make its appearance after. It is the only one among thehawks that has not hooked talons; neither is it like the restof them in the head, or, indeed, in any other respect, exceptthe colour only, while in the beak it bears a stronger resemblance to the pigeon. In addition to this, it is devoured by thehawk, if they chance at any time to meet; this being the onlyone among the whole race of birds that is preyed upon by thoseof its own kind. It changes its voice also with its appearance,comes out in the spring, and goes into retirement at the risingof the Dog-star. It always lays its eggs in the nest of anotherbird, and that of the ring-dove<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> more especially,-mostly a singleegg, a thing that is the case with no other bird; sometimes however, but very rarely, it is known to lay two. It is supposed,that the reason for its thus substituting its young ones, is thefact that it is aware<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> how greatly it is hated by all the otherbirds; for even the very smallest of them will attack it.Hence it is, that it thinks its own race will stand no chanceof being perpetuated unless it contrives to deceive them, and forthis reason builds no nest of its own: and besides this, it isa very timid animal. In the meantime, the female bird, sittingon her nest, is rearing a supposititious and spurious progeny;while the young cuckoo, which is naturally craving and greedy,snatches away all the food from the other young ones, and byso doing grows plump and sleek, and quite gains the affectionsof his foster-mother; who takes a great pleasure in his fine<pb n="2490" />appearance, and is quite surprised that she has become themother of so handsome an offspring. In comparison with him,she discards her own young as so many strangers, until at last,when the young cuckoo is now able to take the wing, hefinishes by devouring<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> her. For sweetness of the flesh, thereis not a bird in existence to be compared to the cuckoo at thisseason.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier says, that this notion is still entertained by the Frenchpeasantry.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is not the case. It only lays in the nests of insectivorous birds.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier remarks, that this is not a very good reason; but we have notyet been able to find a better.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier denies this story, but says, that when the foster-mother is avery small bird, the young cuckoo will take the whole of her head in hisbeak when receiving food.</p></body>
