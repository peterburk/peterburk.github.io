<div2 type="chapter" n="93" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 93. (22.)—ONE REMEDY DERIVED FROM THE LEUCANTHEMUM. NINE REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE AMARACUS.</head><p>The leucanthemum,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> mixed with two-thirds of vinegar, iscurative of asthma. The sampsuchum or amaracus,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>—that ofCyprus being the most highly esteemed, and possessed of thefinest smell—is a remedy for the stings of scorpions, appliedto the wound with vinegar and salt. Used as a pessary, too,it is very beneficial in cases of menstrual derangement; butwhen taken in drink, its properties are not so powerfully developed. Used with polenta, it heals defluxions of the eyes;and the juice of it, boiled, dispels gripings of the stomach. Itis useful, too, for strangury and dropsy; and in a dry state, itpromotes sneezing. There is an oil extracted from it, known<pb n="4379" />as "sampsuchinum," or "amaracinum," which is very goodfor warming and softening the sinews; it has a warming effect,also, upon the uterus. The leaves are good for bruises, beatenup with honey, and, mixed with wax, for sprains.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See c. 34 of this Book; also B. xxii. c. 26.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See c. 35 of this Book.</p></body>
