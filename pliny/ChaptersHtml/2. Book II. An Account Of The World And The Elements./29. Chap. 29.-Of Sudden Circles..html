Fabius<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>, and a circle in that of C. Porciusand M. Acilius. (30.) There was a little circle of a redcolour in the consulship of L. Julius and P. Rutilius.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The term here employed is "arcus," which is a portion only of a circleor "orbis." But if we suppose that the sun was near the horizon, aportion only of the halo would be visible, or the condition of the atmosphere adapted for forming the halo might exist in one part only, so thata portion of the halo only would be obscured.</p></body>
