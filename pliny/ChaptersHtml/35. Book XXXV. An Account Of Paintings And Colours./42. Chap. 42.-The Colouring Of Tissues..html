This done, the tissues,still unchanged in appearance, are plunged into a cauldron ofboiling dye, and are removed the next moment fully coloured.It is a singular fact, too, that although the dye in the pan is ofone uniform colour, the material when taken out of it is ofvarious colours, according to the nature of the mordents thathave been respectively applied to it: these colours, too, will neverwash out. Thus the dye-pan, which under ordinary circum-<pb n="6283" />stances, no doubt, would have made but one colour of several,if coloured tissues had been put into it, is here made to yieldseveral colours from a single dye. At the same moment thatit dyes the tissues, it boils in the colour; and it is the fact,that material which has been thus submitted to the action offire becomes stouter and more serviceable for wear, than itwould have been if it had not been subjected to the process</p></div2></body>
