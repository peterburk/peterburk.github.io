<div2 type="chapter" n="32" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 32.ÑVARIOUS KINDS OF FRANKINCENSE.</head><p>In former times, when they had fewer opportunities ofselling it, they used to gather the frankincense only once ayear; but at the present day, as there is a much greater demand for it, there is a second crop as well. The first, andwhat we may call the natural, vintage, takes place about therising of the Dog-star, a period when the heat is most intense;on which occasion they cut the tree where the bark appearsto be the fullest of juice, and extremely thin, from being distended to the greatest extent. The incision thus made is gradually extended, but nothing is removed; the consequence ofwhich is, that an unctuous foam oozes forth, which graduallycoagulates and thickens. When the nature of the locality requires it, this juice is received upon mats of palm-leaves, thoughin some places the space around the tree is made hard by beingwell rammed down for the purpose. The frankincense thatis gathered after the former method, is in the purest state,though that which falls on the ground is the heaviest inweight: that which adheres to the tree is pared off with aniron instrument, which accounts for its being found mingledwith pieces of bark.</p><p>The forest is allotted in certain portions, and such is themutual probity of the owners, that it is quite safe from alldepredation; indeed, there is no one left to watch the treesafter the incisions are made, and yet no one is ever known to<pb n="3127" />plunder his neighbour. But, by Hercules! at Alexandria,where the incense is dressed for sale, the workshops can neverbe guarded with sufficient care; a seal is even placed upon theworkmen's aprons, and a mask put upon the head, or else anet with very close meshes, while the people are strippednaked before they are allowed to leave work. So true it isthat punishments afford less security among us than is to befound by these Arabians amid their woods and forests! Theincense which has accumulated during the summer is gatheredin the autumn: it is the purest of all, and is of a white colour.The second gathering takes place in spring, incisions beingmade in the bark for that purpose during the winter: this,however, is of a red colour, and not to be compared with theother incense. The first, or superior kind of incense, is knownas carfiathum,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> the latter is called dathiathum. It is thought,also, that the incense which is gathered from the tree whileyoung is the whitest, though the produce of the old trees hasthe most powerful smell; some persons, too, have an impression that the best incense is found in the islands, but Jubaasserts that no incense at all is grown there.</p><p>That incense which has hung suspended in globular drops isknown to us as "male" frankincense, although it is mostlythe case that we do not use the term "male" except in contradistinction to the word "female:" it has been attributed,however, to religious scruples, that the name of the other sexwas not employed as a denomination for this substance. Somepersons, again, are of opinion that the male frankincense hasbeen so called from its resemblance<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> to the testes of the male.The incense, however, that is the most esteemed of all is thatwhich is mammose, or breast-shaped, and is produced whenone drop has stopped short, and another, following close uponit, has adhered, and united with it. I find it stated that oneof these lumps used to make quite a handful, at a time whenmen displayed less eagerness to gather it, and it was allowedmore time to accumulate. The Greeks call such lumps as<pb n="3128" />these by the name of stagonia<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and atomus,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> while the smallerpieces are called orobia.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> The fragments which are broken offby shaking the tree are known to us as manna.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> Even at thepresent day, however, there are drops found which weigh one-third of a mina, or, in other words, twenty-eight denarii.Alexander the Great, when a boy, was on one occasion loadingthe altars with frankincense with the greatest prodigality,upon which his tutor Leonides<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> remarked to him that itwould be time to worship the gods in such a lavish manneras that, when he had conquered the countries that producedthe frankincense. After Alexandria had conquered Arabia,he despatched to Leonides a ship freighted with frankincense,and sent him word, requesting that he would now worship thegods without stint or limit.</p><p>The incense, after being collected, is carried on camels'backs to Sabota,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> at which place a single gate is left open forits admission. To deviate from the high road while conveying it, the laws have made a capital offence. At this place thepriests take by measure, and not by weight, a tenth part inhonour of their god, whom they call Sabis; indeed, it is notallowable to dispose of it before this has been done: out ofthis tenth the public expenses are defrayed, for the divinitygenerously entertains all those strangers who have made a certain number of days' journey in coming thither. The incensecan only be exported through the country of the Gebanit¾,and for this reason it is that a certain tax is paid to theirking as well. Thomna,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> which is their capital, is distantfrom Gaza, a city of Jud¾a, on the shores of our sea, 4436<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span><span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span><pb n="3129" />miles, the distance being divided into sixty-five days' journeyby camel. There are certain portions also of the frankincensewhich are given to the priests and the king's secretaries: andin addition to these, the keepers of it, as well as the soldierswho guard it, the gate-keepers, and various other employes,have their share as well. And then besides, all along theroute, there is at one place water to pay for, at another fodder,lodging at the stations, and various taxes and imposts besides;the consequence of which is, that the expense for each camelbefore it arrives at the shores of our<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> sea is six hundred audeighty-eight denarii; after all this, too, there are certain payments still to be made to the farmers of the revenue of ourempire. Hence it is that a pound of the best frankincensesells at six denarii, the second quality five, and the thirdthree. Among us, it is adulterated with drops of white resin,a substance which bears a strong resemblance to it: but thefraud may be easily detected by the methods which havebeen already mentioned.<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> It is tested by the following qualities; its whiteness, size, brittleness, and the readiness withwhich it takes fire when placed on heated coals; in additionto which, it should not give to the pressure of the teeth, butfrom its natural brittleness crumble all to pieces.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">These words are said by some to be derived from the Greek, <foreign lang="greek">karfo\s,</foreign>"a hollow stalk," on account of its lightness, and <foreign lang="greek">da|di/on,</foreign> "a torch," onaccount of its resinous and inflammable qualities.
