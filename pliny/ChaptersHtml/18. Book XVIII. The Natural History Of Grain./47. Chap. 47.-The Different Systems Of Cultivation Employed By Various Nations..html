<div2 type="chapter" n="47" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 47.—THE DIFFERENT SYSTEMS OF CULTIVATION EMPLOYED BY VARIOUS NATIONS.</head><p>As we have now spoken at sufficient length of the severalvarieties of grain and soil, we shall proceed to treat of themethods adopted in tilling the ground, taking care, in the very<pb n="4061" />first place, to make mention of the peculiar facilities enjoyedby Egypt in this respect. In that country, performing theduties of the husbandman, the Nile begins to overflow, asalready stated,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> immediately after the summer solstice or thenew moon, gradually at first, but afterwards with increasedimpetuosity, as long as the sun remains in the sign of Leo,When the sun has passed into Virgo, the impetuosity of theoverflow begins to slacken, and when he has entered Libra theriver subsides. Should it not have exceeded twelve cubits inits overflow, famine is the sure result; and this is equally thecase if it should chance to exceed sixteen; for the higher ithas risen, the more slowly it subsides, and, of course, the seedtimeis impeded in proportion. It was formerly a very generalbelief that immediately upon the subsiding of the waters theEgyptians were in the habit of driving herds of swine overthe ground, for the purpose of treading the seed into the moistsoil—and it is my own impression that this was done in ancienttimes. At the present day even, the operation is not attendedwith much greater labour. It is well known, however, thatthe seed is first laid upon the slime that has been left by theriver on its subsidence, and then ploughed in; this being doneat the beginning of November. After this is done, a few persons areemployed in stubbing, an operation known there as"botanismos." The rest of the labourers, however, have nooccasion to visit the land again till a little before the calendsof April,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and then it is with the reaping-hook. The harvestis completed in the month of May. The stem is never somuch as a cubit in length, as there is a stratum of sand beneath the slime, from which last alone the grain receives itssupport. The best wheat of all is that of the region ofThebais, Egypt<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> being of a marshy character.</p><p>The method adopted at Seleucia in Babylonia is very similarto this, but the fertility there is still greater, owing to theoverflow of the Euphrates and Tigris,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> the degree ofirrigation being artificially modified in those parts. In Syria, too,the furrows are made extremely light, while in many parts of<pb n="4062" />Italy, again, it takes as many as eight oxen to pant and blowat a single plough. All the operations of agriculture, but thisin particular, should be regulated by the oracular precept—"Remember that every locality has its own tendencies."</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. v. c. 10.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">First of April.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot"><hi rend="ital">I. e.</hi> Egypt Proper, the Delta, or Lower Egypt, Thebais being inUpper Egypt.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The overflow of these rivers is by no means to be compared withthat of the Nile.</p></body>
