<div2 type="chapter" n="27" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 27. (27.)—OF THE COLOURS OF THE SKY AND OFCELESTIAL FLAME.</head><p>There is a flame of a bloody appearance (and nothing is<pb n="1061" />more dreaded by mortals) which falls down upon the earth<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>,such as was seen in the third year of the 103rd olympiad,when King Philip was disturbing Greece. But my opinionis, that these, like everything else, occur at stated, naturalperiods, and are not produced, as some persons imagine, from avariety of causes, such as their fine genius may suggest. Theyhave indeed been the precursors of great evils, but I conceivethat the evils occurred, not because the prodigies took place,but that these took place because the evils were appointedto occur at that period<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>. Their cause is obscure in consequence oftheir rarity, and therefore we are not as wellacquainted with them as we are with the rising of the stars,which I have mentioned, and with eclipses and many otherthings.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The meteor here referred to is probably a peculiar form of theaurora borealis, which occasionally assumes a red colour. See theremarks of Fouché, in Ajasson, i. 382.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The doctrine of the author appears to be, that the prodigies are notthe cause, but only the indication of the events which succeed them.This doctrine is referred to by Seneca; "Videbimus an certus omniumrerum ordo ducatur, et alia aliis ita complexa sint, ut quod antecedit,aut causa sit sequentium aut signum." Nat. Quæst. i. 1.</p></body>
