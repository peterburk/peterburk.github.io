<div2 type="chapter" n="18" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 18. (13.)ÑTHE FIFTH REGION OF ITALY.</head><p>The fifth region is that of Picenum, once remarkable forthe denseness of its population; 360,000 Picentines took theoaths of fidelity to the Roman people. They are descendedfrom the Sabines, who had made a vow to celebrate a holyspring<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>. Their territory commenced at the river Aternus<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>,where the present district and colony of Adria<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> is, at a distanceof six miles from the sea. Here we find the river Vomanus,the territories of Pr¾tutia and Palma<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, Castrum Novum<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>,<pb n="1236" />the river Batinus; Truentum<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>, with its river of the same name,which place is the only remnant of the Liburni<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> in Italy; theriver Albula<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>; Tervium, at which the Pr¾tutian district ends,and that of Picenum begins; the town of Cupra<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>, CastellumFirmanorum<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>, and above it the colony of Asculum<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>, the mostillustrious in Picenum; in the interior there is the townof Novana<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>. Upon the coast we have Cluana<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>, Potentia,Numana, founded by the Siculi, and Ancona<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>, a colonyfounded by the same people on the Promontory of Cumerus,forming an elbow of the coast, where it begins to bend in-wards, and distant from Garganus 183 miles. In the interior<pb n="1237" />are the Auximates<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>, the Beregrani<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span>, the Cingulani, the Cuprenses surnamed Montani<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span>, the Falarienses<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span>, the Pausulani,the Planinenses, the Ricinenses, the Septempedani<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span>, theTollentinates, the Treienses, and the Pollentini of UrbsSalvia<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span>.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It was a custom with the early Italian nations, especially the Sabines, in times of danger and distress, to vow to the deity the sacrifice of all the produce of the ensuing spring, that is, of the period from the first day of March till the last day of April. It is probable that in early times human sacrifices were the consequence; but at a later period the following custom was adopted instead. The children were allowed to grow up, and in the spring of their twentieth or twenty-first year were with covered faces driven across the frontier of their native country, to go whithersoever chance or the guidance of the deity might lead them. The Mamertini in Sicily were said to have had this origin.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now the Aterno, which falls into the sea at Atri or Ortona.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A famous city of Etruscan origin, which still retains its name of Adria or Atri. It had very considerable intercourse with Greece, and there are extensive remains of antiquity in its vicinity, towards Ravegnano. The river is still called the Vomano.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">These places are again mentioned in B. xiv. c. 8.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "New Castle." It probably occupied the site of the now deserted town of Santo Flaviano, near the banks of the river Tordino, the Batinus of Pliny, and below the modern town of Giulia Nova.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The river still has the name of Tronto; Porto di Martin Scuro occupies the site of the town.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Who had crossed over as colonists from the opposite coast of Illyricum.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">According to Mannert the river Tesino is the same as the Albula, and Tervium is the modern town of Grotte a Mare; but D'Anville makes the latter to be the town of Cupra next mentioned.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This was called Cupra Maritima, to distinguish it from the town of the Cuprenses Montani, afterwards mentioned. It is said by Strabo to have had its name from the Tyrrhenian name of Juno. From the discovery of an inscription belonging to her temple here, there is little doubt that D'Anville is right in his suggestion that the site of Cupra is at Grotte a Mare, eight miles from the mouth of the Truentus or Tronto.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Fortress of the Firmani," five miles from Firmum, an important city of Picenum. The Fortress was situate at the mouth of the Leta, and was the port of the city. It is still called Porto di Fermo.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Often called "Asculum Picenum" to distinguish it from Asculum in Apulia. It was a place of considerable strength, and played a great part in the Social War. It is unknown at what period it became a Roman colony. The modern city of Ascoli stands on its site.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called Monte Novano, according to D'Anville and Brotier.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Its site is supposed to have been that of the small town called Santo Elpidio a Mare, four miles from the sea, and the same distance north of Fermo. The remains of Potentia are supposed to be those in the vicinity of the modern Porto di Recanati. Numana is supposed to be the modern Umana, near the Cuscione, where, in the seventeenth century, extensive ruins were to be seen.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It still retains its ancient name, which was derived from the Greek <foreign lang="greek">a)gkw\n</foreign> "the elbow," it being situate on a promontory which forms a curve, and almost encloses the port. The promontory is still called Monte Comero. A triumphal arch, erected in honour of Trajan, who constructed a new mole for the port, is still in fine preservation, and there are remains of an amphitheatre.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The modern city of Osimo stands on the site of Auximum, about twelve miles south-west of Ancona. Numerous inscriptions, statues, and other remains have been found there.</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cluver conjectures that Beregra stood at Civitella di Tronto, ten miles north of Teramo; but nothing further relative to it is known. Cingulum was situate on a lofty mountain; the modern town of Cingoli occupies its site.</p><p><span id="note_17"><a href="#ref_17">17. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The mountaineers." They inhabited Cupra Montana, which is supposed to have stood on the same site as the modern Ripa Transone.</p><p><span id="note_18"><a href="#ref_18">18. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The people of Falaria or Faleria. There are considerable remains of this town about a mile from the village of Falerona, among which a theatre and amphitheatre are most conspicuous. The remains of Pausula are supposed to be those seen on the Monte dell' Olmo. The town of the Ricinenses is supposed to have been on the banks of the Potenza, two miles from Macerata, where some remains were to be seen in the seventeenth century.</p><p><span id="note_19"><a href="#ref_19">19. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Septempeda is supposed to have occupied the site of the modern San Severino, on the river Potenza. Tollentinum or Tollentum was probably on the site of the modern Tolentino. The town of the Treienses is supposed to have occupied a site near the modern San Severino, in the vicinity of Montecchio.</p><p><span id="note_20"><a href="#ref_20">20. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A colony of the people of Pollentia was established at Urbs Salvia, occupying the site of the modern Urbisaglia on the bank of the Chiento.</p></body>
