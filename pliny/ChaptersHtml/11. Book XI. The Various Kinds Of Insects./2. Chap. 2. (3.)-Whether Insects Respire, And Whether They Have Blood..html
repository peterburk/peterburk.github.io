<div2 type="chapter" n="2" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 2. (3.)ÑWHETHER INSECTS RESPIRE, AND WHETHERTHEY HAVE BLOOD.</head><p>Many authors deny that insects respire,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and make theassertion upon the ground, that in their viscera there is norespiratory organ to be found. On this ground, they assertthat insects have the same kind of life as plants and trees,there being a very great difference between respiring and merelyhaving life. On similar grounds also, they assert that insectshave no blood, a thing which cannot exist, they say, in anyanimal that is destitute of heart and liver; just as, accordingto them, those creatures cannot breathe which have no lungs.Upon these points, however, a vast number of questions willnaturally arise; for the same writers do not hesitate to denythat these creatures are destitute also of voice,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and this,notwithstanding the humming of bees, the chirping of grasshoppers, and the sounds emitted by numerous other insectswhich will be considered in their respective places. For mypart, whenever I have considered the subject, I have ever feltpersuaded that there is nothing impossible to Nature, nor do Isee why creatures should be less able to live and yet notinhale, than to respire without being possessed of viscera, adoctrine which I have already maintained, when speaking<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> ofthe marine animals; and that, notwithstanding the densityand the vast depth of the water which would appear to impedeall breathing. But what person could very easily believe thatthere can be any creatures that fly to and fro, and live in thevery midst of the element of respiration, while, at the same time,they themselves are devoid of that respiration; that they canbe possessed of the requisite instincts for nourishment, generation, working, and making provision even for time to come,in the enjoyment too (although, certainly, they are not possessed of the organs which act, as it were, as the receptacles<pb n="3004" />of those senses) of the powers of hearing, smelling, and tasting, as well as those other precious gifts of Nature, address,courage, and skilfulness? That these creatures have no blood<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>I am ready to admit, just as all the terrestrial animals are notpossessed of it; but then, they have something similar, by wayof equivalent. Just as in the sea, the s¾piahas<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> a blackliquid in place of blood, and the various kinds of purples, thosejuices which we use for the purposes of dyeing; so, too, is everyinsect possessed of its own vital humour, which, whatever itis, is blood to it. While I leave it to others to form whatopinion they please on this subject, it is my purpose to setforth the operations of Nature in the clearest possible light,and not to enter upon the discussion of points that are repletewith doubt.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">They respire by orifices in the sides of the body, known to naturalistsas <hi rend="ital">stigmata.</hi> The whole body, Cuvier says, forms, in a measure, a system oflungs.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier remarks that the various noises made by insects are in realitynot the voice, as they are not produced by air passing through a larynx.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">B. ix. c. 6.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier remarks, that they have a nourishing fluid, which is of a whitecolour, and acts in place of blood.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The dye of s¾pia, Cuvier remarks, is not blood, nor does it act as such,being an excrementitious liquid.
