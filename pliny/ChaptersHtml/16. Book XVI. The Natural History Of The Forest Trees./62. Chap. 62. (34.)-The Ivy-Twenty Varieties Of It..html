<div2 type="chapter" n="62" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 62. (34.)—THE IVY-TWENTY VARIETIES OF IT.</head><p>It is said that the ivy now grows in Asia,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> though Theophrastus<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> has denied that such is the fact, and asserts that itgrows nowhere in India, except upon Mount Meros.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> He says,too, that Harpalus used every possible exertion to naturalize<pb n="3400" />it in Media, but to no purpose; and that Alexander, in consequence of the rarity of this plant, had himself crowned<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>with it, after the example of Father Liber, when returningvictorious with his army from India: and at the present dayeven, it is used to decorate the thyrsus of that god, and thecasques and bucklers employed by the nations of Thrace intheir sacred ceremonials. The ivy is injurious<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> to all treesand plants, and makes its way through tombs and walls; itforms a haunt much frequented by serpents, for its refreshingcoolness; so that it is a matter for astonishment that thereshould have been such remarkable veneration for this plant.</p><p>The two principal kinds in the ivy, as in other plants, arethe male tree and the female.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> The male is said to have alarger trunk than the female, and a leaf that is harder andmore unctuous, with a flower nearly approaching to purple:indeed, the flower of both the male and female tree stronglyresembles the wild<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>-rose, were it not destitute of smell. Eachof these kinds of ivy is divided into three other varieties:the white<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> ivy, the black,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> and a third known as the helix."<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>These varieties are again subdivided into others, as there isone in which the fruit only is white, and another in which itis only the leaf that is so. In those which have a white fruit,the berry in some cases is closely packed and large, the clusters,which are known as "corymbi," being of a spherical form.So, too, with the selenitium, which has a smaller berry, andfewer clusters; and the same is the case with the black ivy.One kind has a black seed, and another a seed of a saffron<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>colour—it is this last that poets use for their chaplets,<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> andthe leaves of it are not so black as in the other kinds: by some<pb n="3401" />it is known as the ivy of Nysa, by others as that of Bacchus:<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>it is the one that among the black varieties has the largestclusters of all. Some of the Greek writers even distinguishin this last kind two varieties, according to the colour of theberries, the erythranum<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> and the chrysocarpus.<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span></p><p>It is the helix, however, that has the most peculiarities ofall, and in the appearance of the leaf more particularly, whichis small, angular, and of a more elegant shape, the leaf in allthe other kinds being plain and simple. It differs, too, in thedistance between the joints, and in being barren more especially, as it never bears fruit. Some authors, however, thinkthat this difference exists solely in respect of age and not ofkind, and are of opinion that what is the helix when young,becomes the ordinary ivy when old. This, however, is clearlyproved to be an error upon their part, for we find more varietiesof the helix than one, and three in particular—that of a grass-green colour, which is the most abundant of all, the kind witha white leaf, and a third, which is parti-coloured, and knownas the Thracian helix. In that of a grass-green colour, theleaves are smaller, more closely packed together, and symmetrically arranged; while in the other kinds the features are altogether different. In the parti-coloured kind, also, one varietyhas a smaller leaf than usual, similarly arranged, and lyingcloser together, while in the other none of these features areobserved. The leaves, too, are either greater or smaller anddiffer in the disposition of the spots upon them, and in thewhite helix some of them are whiter than others: the grass-green variety, however, is the one that grows to the greatestheight.</p><p>The white helix is in the habit of killing trees by deprivingthem of their juices, and increases to such a degree of densityas to be quite a tree itself. Its characteristics are, a verylarge, broad, leaf, and projecting buds, which in all the otherkinds are bent inwards; its clusters, too, stand out erect.Although, too, all the ivies have arms that throw out a root,those of this variety are particularly branchy and strong; nextto it in strength, are those of the black ivy.<pb n="3402" /></p><p>It is a peculiarity of the white ivy to throw out arms fromthe middle of the leaves, with which it invariably embraces anyobject that may be on either side of it; this is the case, too,with walls, even though it should not be able to clasp them.If the trunk is cut across in ever so many places, it will stilllive and thrive, having as many fresh roots as it has arms, bymeans of which it ensures safety and impunity, while at thesame time it sucks and strangles the trees to which it clings.There are great differences also in the fruit of both the whiteivy and the black; for in some of them the berry is so bitterthat birds will not touch it. There. is an ivy also which growsupright,<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> and stands without any support; being the onlyone that does so among all the varieties, it has thence obtained the distinctive name of "cissos." The chamæcissos,<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span>on the other hand, is never found except creeping upon theground.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Meaning Asia Minor.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hist.
