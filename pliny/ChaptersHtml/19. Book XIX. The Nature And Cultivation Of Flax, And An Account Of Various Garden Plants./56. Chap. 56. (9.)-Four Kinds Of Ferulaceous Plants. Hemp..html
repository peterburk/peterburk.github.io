<div2 type="chapter" n="56" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 56. (9.)—FOUR KINDS OF FERULACEOUS PLANTS. HEMP.</head><p>The other garden plants are of the ferulaceous kind, such asfennel, for instance, very grateful to serpents, as alreadystated,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and used for numerous seasonings when dried; thapsia,too, which bears a close resemblance to fennel, and alreadymentioned by us when speaking<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> of the exotic shrubs. Then,too, there is hemp,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> a plant remarkably useful for makingropes, and usually sown after the west winds have begun toprevail: the more thickly it is sown, the thinner are thestalks. The seed is gathered when ripe, just after the autumnalequinox, and is dried by the agency of the sun, the wind, orsmoke.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> The hemp itself is plucked just after vintage-time,and is peeled and cleaned by the labourers at night.</p><p>The best hemp is that of Alabanda,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> which is used moreparticularly for making hunting-nets, and of which there arethree varieties. The hemp which lies nearest the bark or thepith is the least valuable, while that which lies in the middle,and hence has the name of "mesa," is the most esteemed.The hemp of Mylasa<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> occuplies the second rank. With reference to the size to which it grows, that of Rosea<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> in theSabine territory, equals the trees in height.<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span></p><p>We have already mentioned two kinds of fennel-giant whenspeaking<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> of the exotic shrubs: the seed of it is used in Italyfor food; the plant, too, admits of being preserved, and, ifstored in earthen pots, will keep for a whole year. There are<pb n="4199" />two parts of it that are used for this purpose, the upper stalksand the umbels of the plant. This kind of fennel is sometimes known by the name of "corymbia," and the parts preserved are called "corymbi."</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. viii. c. 41.
