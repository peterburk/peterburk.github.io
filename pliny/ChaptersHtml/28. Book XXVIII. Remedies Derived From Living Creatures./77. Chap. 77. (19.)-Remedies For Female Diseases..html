(19.)—REMEDIES FOR FEMALE DISEASES.</head><p>Menstruation is promoted by using hall's gall, in unwashedwool, as a pessary: Olympias of Thebe adds hyssop and nitre.<pb n="5361" />Ashes, too, of deer's horns are taken in drink for the same purpose, and for derangements of the uterus they are applied topically, as also bull's gall, used as a pessary with opium, in theproportion of two oboli. It is a good plan, too, to use fumigationsfor the uterus, made with deer's hair, burnt. Hinds, they say,when they find themselves pregnant, are in the habit of swallowing a small stone. This stone, when found in their excrements, or in the uterus—for it is to be found there as well—attached to the body as an amulet, is a preventive of abortion.There are also certain small stones, found in the heart and uterusof these animals, which are very useful for women during pregnancy and in travail. As to the kind of pumice-stone whichis similarly found in the uterus of the cow, we have already<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>mentioned it when treating of the formation of that animal.</p><p>A wolf's fat, applied externally, acts emolliently upon theuterus, and the liver of a wolf is very soothing for pains inthat organ. It is found advantageous for women, when neardelivery, to eat wolf's flesh, or, if they are in travail, to havea person near them who has eaten it; so much so, indeed, thatit will act as a countercharm even to any noxious spells whichmay have been laid upon them. In case, however, a personwho has eaten wolf's flesh should happen to enter the roomat the moment of parturition, dangerous effects will be sure tofollow. The hare, too, is remarkably useful for the complaintsof females: the lights of that animal, dried and taken in drink,are beneficial to the uterus; the liver, taken in water with Samianearth, acts as an emmenagogue; and the rennet brings awaythe after-birth, due care being taken by the patient not to bathethe day before. Applied in wool as a pessary, with saffron andleek-juice, this last acts as an expellent upon the dead fœtus. Itis a general opinion that the uterus of a hare, taken with thefood, promotes the conception of male offspring, and that asimilar effect is produced by using the testes and rennet of thatanimal. It is thought, too, that a leveret, taken from the uterusof its dam, is a restorative of fruitfulness to women who areotherwise past child-bearing. But it is the blood of a hare'sfœtus that the magicians recommend males to drink: while foryoung girls they prescribe nine pellets of hare's dung, to ensurea durable firmness to the breasts. For a similar purpose, also,<pb n="5362" />they apply hare's rennet with honey; and to prevent hairsfrom growing again when once removed, they use a linimentof hare's blood.</p><p>For inflations of the uterus, it is found a good plan to applywild boars' dung or swine's dung topically with oil: but astill more effectual remedy is to dry the dung, and sprinkle it,powdered, in the patient's drink, even though she should bein a state of pregnancy or suffering the pains of child-birth.By administering sow's milk with honied wine, parturition isfacilitated; and if taken by itself it will promote the secretion of the milk when deficient in nursing women. By rubbing the breasts of females with sow's blood they are prevented from becoming too large. If pains are felt in thebreasts, they will be alleviated by drinking asses' milk; and thesame milk, taken with honey, has considerable efficacy as anemmenagogue. Stale fat, too, from the same animal, healsulcerations of the uterus: applied as a pessary, in wool, it actsemolliently upon indurations of that organ; and, applied freshby itself, or in water when stale, it has all the virtues of adepilatory.</p><p>An ass's milt, dried and applied in water to the breasts,promotes the secretion of the milk; and used in the form of afumigation, it acts as a corrective upon the uterus. A fumigation made with a burnt ass's hoof; placed beneath a woman,accelerates parturition, so much so, indeed, as to expel the deadfœtus even: hence it is that it should only be employed in casesof miscarriage, it having a fatal effect upon the living fœtus.Asses' dung, applied fresh, has a wonderful effect, they say, inarresting discharges of blood in females: the same, too, withthe ashes of this dung, which, used as a pessary, are very goodfor the uterus. If the skin is rubbed with the foam from ahorse's mouth for forty days together, before the first hair hasmade its appearance, it will effectually prevent the growththereof: a decoction, too, made from deer's antlers is productiveof a similar effect, being all the better if they are used quitefresh. Mares' milk, used as an injection, is highly beneficialto the uterus.</p><p>Where the fœtus is felt to be dead in the uterus, thelichens or excrescences from a horse's legs, taken in freshwater, will act as an expellent: an effect produced also by afumigation made with the hoofs or dry dung of that animal.<pb n="5363" />Procidence of the uterus is arrested by using butter, in theform of an injection; and indurations of that organ are removedby similarly employing ox-gall, with oil of roses, turpentinebeing applied externally in wool. They say, too, that a fumigation, made from ox-dung, acts as a corrective upon procidenceof the uterus, and facilitates parturition; and that conceptionis promoted by the use of cows' milk. It is a well-knownfact that sterility is often entailed by suffering in child-birth;an evil which may be averted, Olympias of Thebes assures us,by rubbing the parts, before sexual intercourse, with bull'sgall, serpents' fat, verdigrease, and honey. In cases, too, wheremenstruation is too abundant, the external parts should besprinkled with a solution of calf's gall, the moment before thesexual congress; a method which acts emolliently also uponindurations of the abdomen. Applied to the navel as a liniment, it arrests excessive discharges, and is generally beneficialto the uterus. The proportions generally adopted are—onedenarius of gall, one-third of a denarius of opium, and as muchoil of almonds as may appear to be requisite; the whole beingapplied in sheep's wool. The gall, too, of a bull-calf is beatenup with half the quantity of honey, and kept in readiness forthe treatment of uterine diseases. If a woman about the timeof conception eats roasted veal with the plant aristolochia,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> shewill bring forth a male child, we are assured. Calf's marrow,boiled in wine and water with the suet, and applied as a pessary, is good for ulcerations of the uterus; the same, too, withfoxes' fat and cats' dung, the last being applied with resin andoil of roses.</p><p>It is considered a remarkably good plan to subject the uterusto fumigations made with burnt goats' horns. The blood ofthe wild goat, mixed with sea-palm,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> acts as a depilatory. Thegall of the other kinds of goat, used as an injection, actsemolliently upon callosities of the uterus, and ensures conception immediately after menstruation: it possesses also thevirtues of a depilatory, the application being left for three daysupon the flesh after the hair has been removed. The midwivesassure us that she-goats' urine, taken in drink, and the dung,applied topically, will arrest uterine discharges, howevermuch in excess. The membrane in which the kid is enclosed in the uterus, dried and taken in wine, acts as an expel-<pb n="5364" />lent upon the after-birth. For affections of the uterus, it isthought a desirable plan to fumigate it with burnt kids' hair;and for discharges of blood, kids' rennet is administered indrink, or seed of henbane is applied. According to Osthanes,if a woman's loins are rubbed with blood taken from the ticksupon a black wild bull, she will be inspired with an aversion tosexual intercourse: she will forget, too, her former love, bytaking a he-goat's urine in drink, some nard being mixed withit to disguise the loathsome taste.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In 1. xi. c. 79,</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxv. cc. 79, 84, 91.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xiii. c. 49.</p></body>
