<div2 type="chapter" n="94" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 94. (23.)—TEN REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE ANEMONE OR PHRENION.</head><p>We have as yet spoken<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> only of the anemone used for makingchaplets; we will now proceed to describe those kinds whichare employed for medicinal purposes. Some persons give thename of "phrenion" to this plant: there are two species ofit; one of which is wild,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and the other grows on cultivated<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>spots; though they are, both of them, attached to a sandysoil. Of the cultivated anemone there are numerous varieties;some, and these are the most abundant, have a scarlet flower,while others, again, have a flower that is purple or else milk-white. The leaves of all these three kinds bear a strong resemblance to parsley, and it is not often that they exceed halfa foot in height, the head being very similar to that of asparagus. The flower never opens, except while the wind isblowing, a circumstance to which it owes its name.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> The wildanemone is larger than the cultivated one, and has broaderleaves, with a scarlet flower.</p><p>Some persons erroneously take the wild anemone to be thesame as the argemone,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> while others, again, identify it withthe poppy which we have mentioned<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> under the name of"rhœas:" there is, however, a great difference between them,as these two other plants blossom later than the anemone, nordoes the anemone possess a juice or a calyx like theirs; besideswhich, it terminates in a head like that of asparagus.</p><p>The various kinds of anemone are good for pains and inflammations of the head, diseases of the uterus, and stoppageof the milk in females; taken, too, in a ptisan, or applied as apessary in wool, they promote the menstrual discharge. Theroot, chewed, has a tendency to bring away the phlegm, and<pb n="4380" />is a cure for tooth-ache: a decoction of it is good, too, fordefluxions of the eyes,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> and effaces the scars left by wounds.The Magi have attributed many very wonderful properties tothese plants: they recommend it to be gathered at the earliestmoment in the year that it is seen, and certain words to berepeated, to the effect that it is being gathered as a remedy fortertian and quartan fevers; after which the flower must bewrapped up in red cloth and kept in the shade, in order to beattached to the person when wanted. The root of the anemone with a scarlet flower, beaten up and applied to the bodyof any animated being,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> produces an ulcer there by the agencyof its acrid qualities; hence it is that it is so much employedas a detergent for ulcerous sores.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In c. 38 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Anemone coronaria of Linnæus, Fée thinks.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably the Adonis æstivalis of Linnæus, a ranunculus.
