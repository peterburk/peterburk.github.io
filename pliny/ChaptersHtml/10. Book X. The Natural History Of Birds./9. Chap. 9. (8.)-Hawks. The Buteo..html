THE BUTEO.</head><p>We find no less than sixteen<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> kinds of hawks mentioned;among these are the ægithus, which is lame<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> of one leg, andis looked upon as the most favourable omen for the augurs onthe occasion of a marriage, or in matters connected with property in the shape of cattle: the triorchis also, so calledfrom the number of its testicles,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and to which Phemonoë hasassigned the first rank in augury. This last is by the Romansknown as the "buteo;" indeed there is a family<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> that hastaken its surname from it, from the circumstance of this birdhaving given a favourable omen by settling upon the ship ofone of them when he held a command. The Greeks call one<pb n="2488" />kind<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> "epileus;" the only one, indeed, that is seen at all seasonsof the year, the others taking their departure in the winter.</p><p>The various kinds are distinguished by the avidity withwhich they seize their prey; for while some will only pounceon a bird while on the ground, others will only seize it whilehovering round the trees, others, again, while it is perched aloft,and others while it is flying in mid air. Hence it is thatpigeons, on seeing them, are aware of the nature of the dangerto which they are exposed, and either settle on the ground orelse fly upwards, instinctively protecting themselves by takingdue precautions against their natural propensities. The hawksof the whole of Massæsylia, breed in Cerne,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> an island ofAfrica, lying in the ocean; and none of the kinds that areaccustomed to those parts will breed anywhere else.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle says ten.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A mere fable.
