(14.)—THE LUPINE.</head><p>The lupine is the next among the leguminous plants thatis in extensive use, as it serves for food for man in commonwith the hoofed quadrupeds. To prevent it from springingout of the pod<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> while being gathered, and so lost, the bestplan is to gather it immediately after a shower. Of all theseeds that are sown, there is not one of a more marvellous nature than this, or more favoured by the earth. First of all,it turns every day with the sun,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and shows the hour to thehusbandman, even though the weather should happen to becloudy and overcast. It blossoms, too, no less than threetimes, and so attached is it to the earth, that it does not require to be covered with the soil; indeed, this is the only seedthat does not require the earth to be turned up for sowing it.It thrives more particularly on a sandy, dry, and even gravellysoil; and requires no further care to be taken in its cultivation. To such a degree is it attached to the earth, that even<pb n="4050" />though left upon a soil thickly covered with brambles, it willthrow out a root amid the leaves and brakes, and so con-trive to reach the ground. We have already stated<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> that thesoil of a field or vineyard is enriched by the growth of acrop of lupines; indeed, so far is it from standing in need ofmanure, that the lupines will act upon it as well as the verybest. It is the only seed that requires no outlay at all, somuch so, in fact, that there is no necessity to carry it even to thespot where it is sown; for it may be sown the moment it isbrought from the threshing-floor:<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and from the fact that itfalls from the pod of its own accord, it stands in need of noone to scatter it.</p><p>This is<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> the very first grain sown and the last that is gathered,both operations generally taking place in the month of September; indeed, if this is not done before winter sets in, it isliable to receive injury from the cold. And then, besides, itmay even be left with impunity to lie upon the ground, in caseshowers should not immediately ensue and cover it in, it beingquite safe from the attacks of all animals, on account of itsbitter taste: still, however, it is mostly covered up in a slightfurrow. Among the thicker soils, it is attached to a red earthmore particularly. In order to enrich<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> this earth, it should beturned up just after the third blossom; but where the soil issandy, after the second. Chalky and slimy soils are the onlyones that it has an aversion to; indeed, it will never come toanything when sown in them. Soaked in warm water, it isused as a food, too, for man. One modius is a sufficient mealfor an ox, and it is found to impart considerable vigour tocattle; placed, too, upon the abdomen<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> of children, it acts asa remedy in certain cases. It is an excellent plan to seasonthe lupine by smoking it; for when it is kept in a moist state,maggots are apt to attack the germ, and render it useless forreproduction. If cattle have eaten it off while in leaf, as amatter of necessity it should be ploughed in as soon as possible.<pb n="4051" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In consequence of the brittleness of the pod.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is an exaggeration of certain phænomena observed in the leavesof all leguminous plants.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. xvii. c. 6.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Ex areâ."
