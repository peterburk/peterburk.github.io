<div2 type="chapter" n="85" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 85.ÑANIMALS WHOSE ORIGIN IS STILL UNKNOWN.</head><p>But it is mice that surpass all the other animals in fecundity;<pb n="2545" />and it is not without some hesitation that I speak of them, although I have Aristotle and some of the officers of Alexanderthe Great for my authority. It is said that these animals generate by licking one another, and not by copulation. Theyhave related cases where a single female has given birth to onehundred and twenty young ones, and in Persia some werefound, even pregnant themselves,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> while yet in the wombof the parent. It is believed also that these animals will become pregnant on tasting salt. Hence we find that we haveno longer any reason to wonder how such vast multitudes offield-mice devastate the standing corn; though it is still amystery, with reference to them, in what way it is that suchmultitudes die so suddenly; for their dead bodies are neverto be found, and there is not a person in existence that has everdug up a mouse in a field during the winter. Multitudes ofthese animals visit Troas, and before this they have drivenaway the inhabitants in consequence of their vast numbers.</p><p>They multiply greatly during times of drought; it is saidalso that when they are about to die, a little worm grows intheir head. The mice of Egypt have hard hairs, just like thoseof the hedge-hog. They walk on their hind feet, as also do thoseof the Alps. When two animals couple of different kinds, theunion is only prolific if the time of gestation is the same inboth. Among the oviparous quadrupeds, it is generally believedthat the lizard brings forth by the mouth, though Aristotledenies the fact. These animals, too, do not sit upon their eggs,as they forget in what place they have laid them, being utterlydestitute of memory; hence it is that the young ones arehatched spontaneously.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. vi. c. 37, does not quite say this. He saysthat the young ones looked "as if" they were pregnant. <foreign lang="greek">oi(=on ku/onta.</foreign></p></body>
