<div2 type="chapter" n="24" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 24.—IN WHAT MALADIES WINE SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED; HOW IT SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED, AND AT WHAT TIMES.</head><p>We shall now proceed to speak of wine in relation to itsmedicinal uses. The wines of Campania<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> which have theleast body, are the most wholesome beverage for persons ofrank and station; and for the lower classes<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> the best kind ofwine is that which is the most pleasant to the person whodrinks it, provided he is in robust health. For persons of allranks, however, the most serviceable wine is that the strength<pb n="4475" />of which has been reduced by the strainer;<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> for we must bearin mind that wine is nothing else but juice of grapes whichhas acquired strength by the process of fermentation. A mixture of numerous kinds of wine is universally bad, and themost wholesome wine of all is that to which no ingredient hasbeen added when in a state of must; indeed, it is still betterif the vessels even in which it is kept have never been pitched.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>As to wines which have been treated with marble, gypsum,or lime,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> where is the man, however robust he may be, thathas not stood in dread of them?</p><p>Wines which have been prepared with sea-water<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> are par-ticularly injurious to the stomach, nerves, and bladder. Thosewhich have been seasoned with resin are generally lookedupon as beneficial to a cold stomach, but are considered unsuitable where there is a tendency to vomit: the same, too, withmust, boiled grape-juice,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> and raisin wine. New wines sea-soned with resin are good for no one, being productive ofvertigo and head-ache: hence it is that the name of "crapula"<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> has been given equally to new resined wines, and tothe surfeit and head-ache which they produce.</p><p>The wines above mentioned<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> by name, are good for coughand catarrh, as also for cœliac affections, dysentery, andthe catamenia. Those wines of this sort which are red<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> orblack,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> are more astringent and more heating than the others.Wines which have been seasoned with pitch only, are not soinjurious; but at the same time we must bear in mind thatpitch is neither more nor less than resin liquefied<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> by the actionof fire, These pitched wines are of a heating nature, promotethe digestion, and act as a purgative; they are good, also, forthe chest and the bowels, for pains in the uterus, if there areno signs of fever, for inveterate fluxes, ulcerations, ruptures,spasms, suppurated abscesses, debility of the sinews, flatulency,<pb n="4476" />cough, asthma, and sprains, in which last case they are appliedin uncleansed wool. For all these purposes the wine is preferred which has naturally the flavour of pitch,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> and isthence known as "picatum:" it is generally agreed, however,that the produce of the vine called "helvennaca,"<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> if taken intoo large a quantity, is trying to the head.</p><p>In reference to the treatment of fever, it is well known thatwine should never be given, unless the patient is an aged person, or the symptoms are beginning to abate. In cases of acutefever, wine must never be given, under any circumstance,except when there is an evident remission of the attack, andmore particularly if this takes place in the night, for then thedanger is diminished by one half, there being the probabilityof the patient sleeping off the effects of the wine. It is equallyforbidden, also, to females just after delivery or a miscarriage,and to patients suffering from over-indulgence of the sexualpassions; nor should it be given in cases of head-ache, ofmaladies in which the attacks are attended with chills at theextremities, of fever accompanied with cough, of tremulousness<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> in the sinews, of pains in the fauces, or where the diseaseis found to concentrate itself in the iliac regions. Wine isstrictly forbidden, too, in cases of induration of the thoracicorgans, violent throbbings of the veins, opisthotony, tetanus,asthma, and hardness of breathing attended with fever.</p><p>Wine is far from beneficial for a patient, when the eyes arefixed and rigid, and when the eyelids are immoveable, or elserelaxed and heavy; in cases, too, where, with an incessant nictation, the eyes are more than usually brilliant, or where theeyelids refuse to close—the same, too, if that symptomshould occur in sleep—or where the eyes are suffused withblood, or congealed matter makes its appearance in the cornersof those organs. The same rule should be observed, also, whenthe tongue is heavy and swollen, or when there is an impediment from time to time in the speech, when the urine is passedwith difficulty, or when a person has been seized with a suddenfright, with spasms, or recurrent fits of torpor, or experiencesseminal discharges during sleep.<pb n="4477" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The wines of Surrentum and Stata were Campanian wines.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Volgo."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Sacco."
