<div2 type="chapter" n="22" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 22.—THE CYCLADES.</head><p>Beyond Eubœa, and out in the Myrtoan<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> Sea, are numerousother islands; but those more especially famous are, Glau-<pb n="1318" />connesos and the Ægila<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>. Off the promontory, too, ofGeræstus are the Cyclades, lying in a circle around Delos,from which circumstance<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> they derive their name. Thefirst of them is the one called Andros<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> with a city of thesame name, distant from Geræstus ten miles, and from Ceosthirty-nine. Myrsilus tells us that this island was at firstcalled Cauros, and after that Antandros; Callimachus callsit Lasia, and others again Nonagria, Hydrussa, and Epagris.It is ninety-three miles in circumference. At a distance ofone mile from Andros and of fifteen from Delos, is Tenos<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>,with a city of the same name; this island is fifteen milesin length. Aristotle says that it was formerly called Hydrussa, from the abundance of water found here, while somewriters call it Ophiussa<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>. The other islands are, Myconos<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>,with the mountain of Dimastus<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>, distant from Delos fifteen<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>miles; Siphnus<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>, formerly called Meropia and Acis,twenty-eight miles in circumference; Seriphus<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>, twelve milesincircuit; Prepesinthus<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>; Cythnos<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>; and then, by far the mostfamous among the Cyclades, and lying in the very middleof them, Delos<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> itself; so famous for its temple of Apollo,and its extensive commerce. This island long floated on thewaves, and, as tradition says, was the only one that had never<pb n="1319" />experienced an earthquake, down to the time of M. Varro<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>;Mucianus however has informed us, that it has been twiceso visited. Aristotle states that this island received itsname from the fact of its having so suddenly made itsappearance<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> on emerging from the sea; Aglaosthenes, however, gives it the name of Cynthia, and others of Ortygia<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span>,Asteria, Lagia, Chlamydia, Cynthus, and, from the circumstance of fire having been first discovered here, Pyrpile. Itscircumference is five miles only; Mount Cynthus<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> hereraises his head.</p><p>Next to this island is Rhene<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span>, which Anticlides calls bythe name of Celadussa, and Callidemus, Artemite; Scyros<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span>,which the old writers have stated to be twenty miles in circumference, but Mucianus 160; Oliaros<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span>; and Paros<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span>, witha city of the same name, distant from Delos thirty-eightmiles, and famous for its marble<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span>; it was first called Platea,<pb n="1320" />and after that, Minois. At a distance of seven miles fromthis last island is Naxos<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span>, with a town of the same name;it is eighteen miles distant from Delos. This island wasformerly called Strongyle<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span>, then Dia, and then Dionysias<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span>,in consequence of the fruitfulness of its vineyards; othersagain have called it the Lesser Sicily, or Callipolis<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span>. It isseventy-five<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span> miles in circumference—half as large again asParos.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hardouin remarks here, that Pliny, Strabo, Mela, and Pausanias usethe term "Myrtoan Sea," as meaning that portion of it which liesbetween Crete and Attica, while Ptolemy so calls the sea which lies offthe coast of Caria.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called Spitilus, and the group of Micronisia, or "Little Islands,"according to Hardouin.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From <foreign lang="greek">ku/klos,</foreign> "a circle."</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Andro. It gives name to one of the comedies of Terence. Theruins of the ancient city were found by the German traveller Ross, whohas published a hymn to Isis, in hexameter verse, which he discoveredhere. It was famous for its wines.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Tino.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From its abounding in snakes (<foreign lang="greek">o)/feis</foreign>) and scorpions.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Mycono, south-east of Tenos and east of Delos.

It is now called Thermia. Cydias thepainter was born here, and it was famous for its cheeses. Its modernname is derived from its hot springs, which are much frequented.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Still called Delos; and, though so celebrated, nothing more than amere rock, five miles in circumference.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">That is, according to Varro, whose statement is ridiculed by Seneca.Some of the editors, however, punctuate this passage differently, makingit to mean, "the only island that has never experienced an earthquake.Mucianus however has informed us, that down to the time of M. Varro,it has been twice so visited."</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From its then becoming <foreign lang="greek">dh=los,</foreign> "plain," or "manifest."

Its name of Asteria was derived from <foreign lang="greek">a)/stron,</foreign> "a star," eitherin consequence of its being devoted to the worship of the great luminaryApollo, or of its being considered by the gods the star of the earth. It wasalso called Lagia, from <foreign lang="greek">lagw\s,</foreign> "a hare," that animalabounding there; and Cynæthus, from <foreign lang="greek">ku/wn,</foreign> "a dog," it beingfamous for its hounds.</p><p><span id="note_18"><a href="#ref_18">18. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A bare granite rock, not more than 500 feet in height. The islandis now a mass of ruins; a great part of its remains having been carriedaway in the middle ages to Venice and Constantinople.</p><p><span id="note_19"><a href="#ref_19">19. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Divided by a strait of four stadia in width from Delos. Niciasconnected the two islands by a bridge. Its name of Celadussa was saidto be derived from the noise of the waves, <foreign lang="greek">ke/lados,</foreign> and ofArtemite, from Artemis, or Diana.</p><p><span id="note_20"><a href="#ref_20">20. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Syra; famous for its wine and corn.</p><p><span id="note_21"><a href="#ref_21">21. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Antiparos; famous for its stalactite grotto, which is notmentioned by the ancient writers.</p><p><span id="note_22"><a href="#ref_22">22. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Paro; south of Delos and west of Naxos.
