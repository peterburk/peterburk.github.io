When their work is completed, their offspring brought forth, and all their duties fulfilled, they still have certain formal exercises to perform, rangingabroad throughout the country, and soaring aloft in the air,wheeling round and round as they fly, and then, when thehour for taking their food has come, returning home. Theextreme period of their life, supposing that they escape accident and the attacks of their enemies, is only seven years;a hive, it is said, never lasts more than ten.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> There are somepersons, who think that, when dead, if they are preservedin the house throughout the winter, and then exposed to thewarmth of the spring sun, and kept hot all day in the ashesof fig-tree wood, they will come to life again.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier says that a hive has been known to last more than thirty years:but it is doubtful if bees ever live so long as ten, or, except the queen,little more than one.</p></body>
