(25.)—BALSAMUM; OPOBALSAMUM; AND XYLOBAL-SAMUM.</head><p>But to all other odours that of balsamum<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> is consideredpreferable, a plant that has been only bestowed by Natureupon the land of Judæa. In former times it was cultivated intwo gardens only, both of which belonged to the kings of thatcountry: one of them was no more than twenty jugera inextent, and the other somewhat smaller. The emperors Ves-pasianus and Titus had this shrub exhibited at Rome; indeed,it is worthy of signal remark, that since the time of PompeiusMagnus, we have been in the habit of carrying trees even inour triumphal processions. At the present day this tree paysus homage and tribute along with its native land, but it hasbeen found to be of altogether a different nature to that which<pb n="3148" />our own as well as foreign writers had attributed to it: for, infact, it bears a much stronger resemblance to the vine than tothe myrtle. This recent acquisition by conquest has learned,like the vine, to be reproduced by mallet<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>-shoots, and itcovers declivities just like the vine, which supports its ownweight without the aid of stays. When it puts forth branchesit is pruned in a similar manner, and it thrives by being wellraked at the roots, growing with remarkable rapidity, andbearing fruit at the end of three years. The leaf bears a veryconsiderable resemblance to that of rue, and it is an evergreen. The Jews vented their rage upon this shrub just asthey were in the habit of doing against their own lives andpersons, while, on the other hand, the Romans protected it; indeed, combats have taken place before now in defence of a shrub.At the present day the reproduction of it has become a dutyof the fiscal authorities, and the plants were never known tobe more numerous or of larger growth; they never exceed theheight, however, of a couple of cubits.</p><p>There are three different kinds of balsamum. The first hasa thin and hair-like foliage, and is known by the name ofeutheriston.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> The second is of a rugged appearance, bendingdownwards, full of branches, and more odoriferous than thefirst; the name of this is trachy. The third kind is theeumeces, so called, because it is taller than the others; it hasa smooth, even, bark. It is the second in quality, the eutheriston being inferior to the trachy. The seed of this planthas a flavour strongly resembling that of wine; it is of areddish colour, and not without a certain amount of unctuousness; the grains of inferior quality are lighter in weight andof a greener hue: the branches of the shrub are thicker thanthose of the myrtle. Incisions are made in it either withglass, or else a sharp stone, or knives made of bone: it beinghighly injurious to touch the vital parts with iron, for in suchcase it will immediately wither away and die. On the otherhand, it will allow of all the superfluous branches being prunedaway with an instrument of iron even. The hand of the<pb n="3149" />person who makes the incision is generally balanced by anartificial guide, in order that he may not accidentally inflict awound in the wood beyond the bark.</p><p>A juice distils from the wound, which is known to usas opobalsamum; it is of extraordinary sweetness,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> but onlyexudes in tiny drops, which are then collected in wool, anddeposited in small horns. When taken from out of these, thesubstance is placed in new earthen vessels; it bears a strongresemblance to a thick oil, and is of a white colour when fresh.It soon, however, turns red, and as it hardens loses its transparency. When Alexander the Great waged war in thoseparts, it was looked upon as a fair summer day's work to fill asingle concha<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> with this liquid; the entire produce of thelarger garden being six congii, and of the smaller one a singlecongius; the price, too, at which it was sold was double itsweight in silver. At the present day the produce of a singletree, even, is larger; the incisions are made three times everysummer, after which the tree is pruned.</p><p>The cuttings, too, form an article of merchandize: the fifthyear after the conquest of Judæa, these cuttings, with thesuckers, were sold for the price of eight hundred thousandsesterces. These cuttings are called xylobalsamum,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> and areboiled down for mixing with unguents, and in the manufactories have been substituted for the juices of the shrub. Thebark is also in great request for medicinal purposes, but it isthe tears that are so particularly valuable; the seed holding<pb n="3150" />the second rank in estimation, the bark the third, and thewood being the least esteemed of all. Of the wood, that kindwhich resembles boxwood is considered the best: it has alsothe strongest smell. The best seed is that which is the largestin size and the heaviest in weight; it has a biting or ratherburning taste in the mouth. Balsamum is adulterated withhypericon:<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> from Petra, but the fraud is easily detected, fromthe fact that the grains of the latter are larger, comparativelyempty, and longer than those of balsamum; they are destitutealso of any pungency of smell, and have a flavour like thatof pepper.</p><p>As to the tears of balsamum, the test of their goodness istheir being unctuous to the touch, small, of a somewhat reddishcolour, and odoriferous when subjected to friction. That ofsecond-rate quality is white; the green and coarse is inferior,and the black is the worst of all; for, like olive-oil, it is aptto turn rancid when old. Of all the incisions, the produce isconsidered the best of those from which the liquid has flowedbefore the formation of the seed. In addition to what hasbeen already stated, it is often adulterated with the juice ofthe seed, and it is with considerable difficulty that the fraud isdetected by a slight bitterness in the taste, which ought to bedelicate and without the slightest mixture of acidity, the onlypungency being that of the smell. It is adulterated also withoil of roses, of cyprus, of mastich, of balanus, of turpentine,and of myrtle, as also with resin, galbanum, and Cyprian wax,just as occasion may serve. But the very worst adulterationof all, is that which is effected with gum, a substance whichis dry when emptied into the hand, and falls to the bottomwhen placed in water; both of which are characteristics of thegenuine commodity. Balsamum, in a genuine state, should bequite hard, but when it is mixed with gum a brittle pellicleforms upon it. The fraud can also be detected by the taste,and when placed upon hot coals it may easily be seen if therehas been any adulteration with wax and resin; the flame too, inthis case, burns with a blacker smoke than when the balsamumis pure. When mixed with honey its qualities are immediately changed, for it will attract flies even in the hand. Inaddition to these various tests, a drop of pure balsamum, ifplaced in luke-warm water will settle to the bottom of the<pb n="3151" />vessel, whereas, if it is adulterated, it will float upon the surface like oil, and if it has been drugged with metopion orhammoniacum, a white circle will form around it. But thebest test of all is, that it will cause milk to curdle, and leaveno stain upon cloth. In no commodity are there practisedmore palpable frauds than in this, for a sextarius of balsamumwhich is sold by the fiscal authorities at three hundred denarii,is sold again for a thousand, so vast is the profit to be derivedfrom increasing this liquid by sophistication. The price ofxylobalsamum is six denarii per pound.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Balsam (or balm of Mecca, as it is sometimes called) is the produceof two trees, probably varieties of one another, of the terebinth family,belonging to the genus Amyris. So far from being a native solely ofJudæa, Bruce assures us that its original country was that which producesmyrrh, in the vicinity of Babelmandel, and that the inhabitants use thewood solely for fuel. In Judæa it appears to have been cultivated solelyin gardens; and it was this tree which produced the famous balm of Gileadof Scripture. The balsam trees known to us do not at all correspond withPliny's description, as they do not resemble either the vine or myrtle, norare their leaves at all like those of rue.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Malleolis." So called when the new shoot of the tree springing froma branch of the former year, is cut off for the sake of planting, with a bitof the old wood on each side of it, in the form of a mallet.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Easily cut." This and the other kinds, the names of which mean"rough barked," and "good length," are probably only varieties of thesame tree, in different states.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is said, probably, in allusion to the smell, and not the taste.Fée remarks, that Pliny speaks with a considerable degree of exaggeration,as its odour is very inferior to that of several balsams which contain benzoic acid. The balsam obtained by incision, as mentioned by Pliny, is notbrought to Europe, but only that obtained by the process of decoction;which is known as "balm of Mecca," or of Judæa. It is difficult to believe.according to Fée, that it was adulterated with the substances here mentioned by Pliny; oil of roses having been always a very precious com-modity, wax being likely to change its nature entirely, and gums not beingof a nature to combine with it. Its asserted effects upon milk he states tobe entirely fabulous; the statement is derived from Dioscorides.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The concha, or "shell," was a Greek and Roman liquid measure, ofwhich there were two sizes. The smaller was half a cyathus, .0412 of anEnglish pint; the larger was about three times the size of the former, andwas known also as the oxybaphum.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "wood of balsam." It is still known in European commerce byits ancient name. The fruit is called Carpobalsamum.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxvi. cc. 53, 54.</p></body>
