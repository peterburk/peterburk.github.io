<div2 type="chapter" n="25" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 25.—RAPE. TURNIPS.</head><p>The other plants that are of a cartilaginous nature are concealed, all of them, in the earth. In the number of these isthe rape, a subject upon which it would almost appear thatwe have treated<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> at sufficient length already, were it not thatwe think it as well to observe, that; medical men call thosewhich are round "male,"<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> while those which are larger andmore elongated, are known to them as "female" rape: theselast are superior in sweetness, and better for keeping, but bysuccessive sowings they are changed into male rape.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span></p><p>The same authors, too, have distinguished five different va-rieties of the turnip:<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> the Corinthian, the Cleonæan, theLiothasian, the Bœotian, and the one which they have characterized as peculiarly the "green" turnip. The Corinthianturnip<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> grows to a very large size, and the root is all but outof the ground; indeed, this is the only kind that, in growing,shoots upwards, and not as the others do, downwards into theground. The Liothasian is known by some persons as theThracian turnip;<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> it is the one that stands extreme cold thebest of all. Next to it, the Bœotian kind is the sweetest; it is remarkable, also, for the roundness of its shape and its shortness;<pb n="4162" />while the Cleonæan turnip,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> on the other hand, is of an elongated form. Those, in general, which have a thin, smooth leaf,are the sweetest; while those, again, the leaf of which is rough,angular, and prickly, have a pungent taste. There is a kindof wild turnip,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> also, the leaves of which resemble those ofrocket.<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> At Rome, the highest rank is given to the turnipsof Amiternum,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> and those of Nursia; after them, those grownin the neighbourhood of the City<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> are held in the next degree of esteem. The other particulars connected with thesowing of the turnip have been already mentioned<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> by us whenspeaking of the rape.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. xviii. c. 34.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Though borrowed from Theophrastus and the Greek school, this distinction is absurd and unfounded.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is not the fact that the seed of the round kind, after repeatedsowings, will produce long roots.

This assertion, however,is no more founded on truth than that of Pliny.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Also from Theophrastus, B. vii. c. 4; though that author is speakingof radishes, <foreign lang="greek">rafani/des,</foreign> and not turnips.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Properly <hi rend="ital">radish.</hi></p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Properly <hi rend="ital">radish.</hi></p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Radish.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Properly <hi rend="ital">radish.</hi></p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xx. c. 49.
