(44.)—THE NATURE OF MULES, <span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> AND OF OTHER BEASTS OF BURDEN.</head><p>From the union of the male ass and the mare a mule is pro-<pb n="2325" />duced in the thirteenth month, an animal remarkable for itsstrength in laborious work. We are told that, for this purpose,the mare ought not to be less than four years old, nor morethan ten. It is said also that these two species will repulseeach other, unless the male has been brought up, in its infancy,upon the milk of the other species; for which reason theytake the foals away from the mare, in the dark, and substitutefor them the male colts of the ass. A mule may also be produced from a horse and a female ass; but it can never be properly broken in, and is incorrigibly sluggish,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> being in allrespects as slow as an old animal. If a mare has conceivedby a horse, and is afterwards covered by an ass, the first conception is abortive; but this is not the case when the horsecomes after the ass. It has been observed, that the female isin the best state for receiving the male in the seventh dayafter parturition, and that the males are best adapted for thepurpose when they are fatigued.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> A female ass, which hasnot conceived before shedding what are called the milk-teeth,is considered to be barren; which is also looked upon as thecase when a she-ass does not become pregnant after the firstcovering. The male which is produced from a horse and afemale ass, was called by the ancients "hinnulus," and thatfrom an ass and a mare "mulus."<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> It has been observedthat the animal which is thus produced by the union of thetwo species is of a third species, and does not resemble eitherof the parents; and that all animals produced in this way, ofwhatever kind they may be, are incapable of reproduction;she-mules are therefore barren. It is said, indeed, in ourAnnals, that they have frequently brought forth;<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> but suchcases must be looked upon only as prodigies.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> Theophrastus<pb n="2326" />says that they commonly bring forth in Cappadocia; but thatthe animal of that country is of a peculiar species.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> Themule is prevented from kicking by frequently giving it wineto drink.<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> It is said in the works of many of the Greekwriters, that from the union of a mule with a mare, the dwarfmule is produced, which they call "ginnus." From the unionof the mare and the wild ass, when it has been domesticated, amule is produced which is remarkably swift in running, and hasextremely hard feet, and a thin body, while it has a spirit thatis quite indomitable. The very best stallion of all, however,for this purpose, is one produced from a union of the wild assand the female domesticated ass. The best wild asses arethose of Phrygia and Lycaonia. Africa glories in the wildfoals which she produces, as excelling all others in flavour;these are called "lalisiones."<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> It appears from some Athenianrecords, that a mule once lived to the age of eighty years. Thepeople were greatly delighted with this animal, because onone occasion, when, on the building of a temple in the citadel,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> it had been left behind on account of its age, it persistedin promoting the work by accompanying and assisting them;in consequence of which a decree was passed, that the dealersin corn were not to drive it away from their sieves.<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Most of the circumstances here mentioned appear to have been takenfrom Aristotle, Hist.
