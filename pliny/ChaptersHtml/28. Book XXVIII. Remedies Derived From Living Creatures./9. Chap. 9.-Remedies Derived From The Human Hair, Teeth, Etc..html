A man's hair, applied with vinegar, is a cure for thebite of a dog, and, used with oil or wine, for wounds on thehead. It is said, too, if we choose to believe it, that the hairof a man torn down from the cross, is good for quartan fevers.Ashes, too, of burnt human hair are curative of carcinomata.If a woman takes the first tooth that; a child has shed, providedit has not touched the ground, and has it set in a bracelet, andwears it constantly upon her arm, it will preserve her fromall pains in the uterus and adjacent parts. If the great toeis tied fast to the one next to it, it will reduce tumours in thegroin; and if the two middle fingers of the right hand areslightly bound together with a linen thread, it will act as apreservative against catarrhs and ophthalmia. A stone, it issaid, that has been voided by a patient suffering from calculi,if attached to the body above the pubes, will alleviate thepains of others similarly afflicted, as well as pains in the liver;it will have the effect, also, of facilitating delivery. Granius<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>adds, however, that for this last purpose, the stone will be moreefficacious if it has been extracted with the knife. Delivery,when near at hand, will be accelerated, if the man by whom<pb n="5292" />the woman has conceived, unties his girdle, and, after tying itround her, unties it, adding at the same time this formula, "Ihave tied it, and I will untie it," and then taking his de-parture.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See end of the present Book.</p></body>
