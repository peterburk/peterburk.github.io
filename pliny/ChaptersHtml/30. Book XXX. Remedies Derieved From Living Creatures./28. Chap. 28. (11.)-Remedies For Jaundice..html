(11.)—REMEDIES FOR JAUNDICE.</head><p>Jaundice is combated by administering ear-wax to the patient,or else the filth that adheres to the udders of sheep, in dosesof one denarius, with a modicum of myrrh, in two cyathi ofwine; the ashes, also, of a dog's head, mixed with honiedwine; a millepede, in one semi-sextarius of wine; earth-worms, in hydromel with myrrh; wine in which a hen'sfeet have been washed, after being first cleansed with water—the hen must be one with yellow<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> feet—the brains of a partridgeor of an eagle, in three cyathi of wine; the ashes of a ring-dove's feathers or intestines, in honied wine, in doses of threespoonfuls; or ashes of sparrows burnt upon twigs, in doses oftwo spoonfuls, in hydromel.</p><p>There is a bird, known as the "icterus,"<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> from its peculiarcolour: if the patient looks at it, he will be cured of jaun-dice, they say, and the bird will die.
