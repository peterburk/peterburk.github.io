(1.)ÑREMARKABLE FACTS CONNECTED WITH WATER.</head><p>WE have now to speak of the benefits derived, in a medicinalpoint of view, from the aquatic productions; for not here evenhas all-bounteous Nature reposed from her work. Amid wavesand billows, and tides of rivers for ever on the ebb and flow,she still unceasingly exerts her powers; and nowhere, if wemust confess the truth, does she display herself in greatermight, for it is this among the elements that holds sway overall the rest. It is water that swallows up dry land, thatextinguishes flame, that ascends aloft, and challenges possession of the very heavens: it is water that, spreading clouds asit does, far and wide, intercepts the vital air we breathe; and,through their collision, gives rise to thunders and lightnings,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>as the elements of the universe meet in conflict.</p><p>What can there be more marvellous than waters suspendedaloft in the heavens? And yet, as though it were not enough toreach so high an elevation as this, they sweep along with themwhole shoals of fishes, and often stones as well, thus ladingthemselves with ponderous masses which belong to otherelements, and bearing them on high. Falling upon the earth,these waters become the prime cause of all that is there produced; a truly wondrous provision of Nature, if we only consider, that in order to give birth to grain and life to trees andto shrubs, water must first leave the earth for the heavens, andthence bring down to vegetation the breath of life! Theadmission must be surely extorted from us, that for all ourresources the earth is indebted to the bounteousness of water.<pb n="5472" />It will be only proper, therefore, in the first place to set forthsome instances of the powerful properties displayed by thiselement; for as to the whole of them, what living mortal coulddescribe them?</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. ii. c. 43. Ajasson remarks, that the electric fluid, forminglightning, escapes from the clouds through causes <hi rend="ital">totally</hi> independent ofwater. Still, Pliny would appear to be right in one sense; for if therewere no water, there would be no clouds; and without clouds the electricfluid would probably take some other form than that of lightning.</p></body>
