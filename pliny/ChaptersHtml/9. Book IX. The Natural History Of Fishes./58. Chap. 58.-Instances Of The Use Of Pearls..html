Nor were these any presents made by aprodigal potentate, but treasures which had descended to herfrom her grandfather, and obtained by the spoliation of theprovinces. Such are the fruits of plunder and extortion! Itwas for this reason that M. Lollius<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> was held so infamous allover the East for the presents which he extorted from the kings;the result of which was, that he was denied the friendship ofCaius Cæsar, and took poison;<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> and all this was done, I say,that his grand-daughter might be seen, by the glare of lamps,covered all over with jewels to the amount of forty millionsof sesterces! Now let a person only picture to himself, onthe one hand, what was the value of the habits worn byCurius or Fabricius in their triumphs, let him picture to himself the objects displayed to the public on their triumphallitters,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> and then, on the other hand, let him think upon thisLollia, this one bit<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> of a woman, the head of an empire, takingher place at table, thus attired; would he not much ratherthat the conquerors had been torn from their very chariots,than that they had conquered for such a result as this?<pb n="2439" /></p><p>Nor, indeed, are these the most supreme evidences of luxury.There were formerly two pearls, the largest that had been everseen in the whole world: Cleopatra, the last of the queens ofEgypt, was in possession of them both, they having come toher by descent from the kings of the East. When Antonyhad been sated by her, day after day, with the most exquisitebanquets, this queenly courtesan, inflated with vanity and disdainful arrogance, affected to treat all this sumptuousness andall these vast preparations with the greatest contempt; uponwhich Antony enquired what there was that could possibly beadded to such extraordinary magnificence. To this she madeanswer, that on a single entertainment she would expend tenmillions<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> of sesterces. Antony was extremely desirous tolearn how that could be done, but looked upon it as a thingquite impossible; and a wager was the result. On the following day, upon which the matter was to be decided, in orderthat she might not lose the wager, she had an entertainmentset before Antony, magnificent in every respect, though nobetter than his usual repast. Upon this, Antony jokedher, and enquired what was the amount expended upon it; towhich she made answer that the banquet which he then beheld was only a trifling appendage<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> to the real banquet, andthat she alone<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> would consume at the meal to the ascertainedvalue of that amount, she herself would swallow the tenmillions of sesterces; and so ordered the second course to beserved. In obedience to her instructions, the servants placedbefore her a single vessel, which was filled with vinegar, aliquid, the sharpness and strength of which is able<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> to dis-<pb n="2440" />solve pearls. At this moment she was wearing in her earsthose choicest and most rare and unique productions of Nature;and while Antony was waiting to see what she was going todo, taking one of them from out of her ear, she threw it into thevinegar, and directly it was melted, swallowed it. LuciusPlancus,<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> who had been named umpire in the wager, placedhis hand upon the other at the very instant that she wasmaking preparations to dissolve it in a similar manner, anddeclared that Antony had lost—an omen which,<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> in the result,was fully confirmed. The fame of the second pearl is equalto that which attends its fellow. After the queen, who hadthus come off victorious on so important a question, had beenseized, it was cut asunder, in order that this, the other half ofthe entertainment, might serve as pendants for the ears ofVenus, in the Pantheon at Rome.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The grand-daughter of M.

Cæsar, whom he accompanied to the East in B. C. 2. He wasa personal enemy of Tiberius, which may in some measure account for thehad character given him by Velleius Paterculus, who describes him as moreeager to make money than to act honourably, and as guilty of every kindof vice. Horace, on the other hand, in the ode addressed to him, Carm. iv.9, expressly praises him for his freedom from all avarice. His son, M.Lollius, was the father of Lollia Paulina.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This does not appear to be asserted by any other author; but VelleiusPaterculus almost suggests as much, B. ii., "Cujus mors intra paucos diesfortuita an voluntaria fuerit ignoro."

B. ii. c. 13. Shemust, however, have employed stronger vinegar than that which we usefor our tables; as pearls, on account of their hardness and their naturalenamel, cannot be easily dissolved by a weak acid. Nature has securedthe teeth of animals against the effect of acids, by an enamel covering,which answers the same purpose; but if this enamel happens to be injuredonly in one small place, the teeth soon spoil and rot. Cleopatra, perhaps,broke and pounded the pearls [pearl]; and it is probable that she afterwards diluted the vinegar with water, that she might be able to drink it;though dissolved calcareous matter neutralizes acids, and renders them imper-ceptible to the tongue. That pearls are not peculiar to one kind of shellfish, as many believe, was known to Pliny." <hi rend="ital">Beckmann's History of In-</hi><hi rend="ital">ventions,</hi> vol. i. p. 258, note 1, <hi rend="ital">Bohn's Ed.</hi> We may remark, howeverthat as the story is told by Pliny, there is no appearance that Cleopatra<hi rend="ital">pounded</hi> the pearl.
