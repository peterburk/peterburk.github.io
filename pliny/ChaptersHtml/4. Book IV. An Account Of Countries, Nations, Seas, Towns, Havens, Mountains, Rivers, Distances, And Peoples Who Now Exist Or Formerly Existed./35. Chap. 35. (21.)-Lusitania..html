<div2 type="chapter" n="35" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 35. (21.)ÑLUSITANIA.</head><p>After passing the Durius, Lusitania<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> begins. We here havethe ancient Turdul<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>, the P¾suri, the river Vaga<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>, the townof Talabrica, the town and river<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> of ®minium, the towns ofConimbrica<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>, Collippo<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>, and Eburobritium<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>. A promontory<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>then advances into the sea in shape of a large horn; by someit has been called Artabrum<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>, by others the Great Promon-<pb n="1364" />tory, while many call it the Promontory of Olisipo, fromthe city<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> near it. This spot forms a dividing line in theland, the sea, and the heavens. Here ends one side<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> ofSpain; and, when we have doubled the promontory, thefront of Spain begins. (22.) On one side of it lie the Northand the Gallic Ocean, on the other the West and the Atlantic.The length of this promontory has been estimated by somepersons at sixty miles, by others at ninety. A considerablenumber of writers estimate the distance from this spot tothe Pyrenees at 1250 miles; and, committing a manifesterror, place here the nation of the Artabri, a nationthat never<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> was here. For, making a slight change in thename, they have placed at this spot the Arrotreb¾, whomwe have previously spoken of as dwelling in front of theCeltic Promontory.</p><p>Mistakes have also been made as to the more celebratedrivers. From the Minius, which we have previously mentioned, according to Varro, the river ®minius<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> is distant200 miles, which others<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> suppose to be situate elsewhere,and called Lim¾a. By the ancients it was called the "Riverof Oblivion," and it has been made the subject of manyfabulous stories. At a distance of 200 miles from theDurius is the Tagus, the Munda<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> lying between them.The Tagus is famous for its golden sands<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span>. At a distance<pb n="1365" />of 160 miles from it is the Sacred Promontory<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span>, projectingfrom nearly the very middle of the front<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> of Spain. Fromthis spot to the middle of the Pyrenees, Varro says, is adistance of 1400 miles; while to the Anas, by which wehave mentioned<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> Lusitania as being separated from B¾tica,is 126 miles, it being 102 more to Gades.</p><p>The peoples are the Celtici, the Turduli, and, about theTagus, the Vettones<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span>. From the river Anas to the SacredPromontory<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> are the Lusitani. The cities worthy of mention on the coast, beginning from the Tagus, are that ofOlisipo<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span>, famous for its mares, which conceive<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span> from thewest wind; Salacia<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span>, which is surnamed the ImperialCity; Merobrica<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span>; and then the Sacred Promontory, withthe other known by the name of Cuneus<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span>, and the towns ofOssonoba<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span>, Balsa<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span>, and Myrtili<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span>.</p><p>The whole of this province is divided into three jurisdictions, those of Emerita, Pax, and Scalabis. It contains inall forty-six peoples, among whom there are five colonies,<pb n="1366" />one municipal town of Roman citizens, three with theancient Latin rights, and thirty-six that are tributaries.The colonies are those of Augusta Emerita<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span>, situate on theriver Anas, Metallinum<span id="ref_31"><a href="#note_31">[31]</a></span>, Pax<span id="ref_32"><a href="#note_32">[32]</a></span>, and Norba<span id="ref_33"><a href="#note_33">[33]</a></span>, surnamed C¾sariana. To this last place of jurisdiction the people ofCastra Servilia<span id="ref_34"><a href="#note_34">[34]</a></span> and Castra C¾cilia<span id="ref_35"><a href="#note_35">[35]</a></span> resort. The fifth jurisdiction is that of Scalabis<span id="ref_36"><a href="#note_36">[36]</a></span>, which also has the name ofPr¾sidium Julium<span id="ref_37"><a href="#note_37">[37]</a></span>. Olisipo, surnamed Felicitas Julia<span id="ref_38"><a href="#note_38">[38]</a></span>, is amunicipal city, whose inhabitants enjoy the rights of Romancitizens. The towns in the enjoyment of the ancient Latinrights are Ebora<span id="ref_39"><a href="#note_39">[39]</a></span>, which also has the name of Liberalitas Julia<span id="ref_40"><a href="#note_40">[40]</a></span>, and Myrtili and Salacia, which we have previously mentioned. Those among the tributaries whom itmay not be amiss to mention, in addition to those already<span id="ref_41"><a href="#note_41">[41]</a></span>alluded to among the names of those in B¾tica, are theAugustobrigenses<span id="ref_42"><a href="#note_42">[42]</a></span>, the Ammienses<span id="ref_43"><a href="#note_43">[43]</a></span>, the Aranditani, theArabricenses, the Balsenses, the Cesarobricenses, the Caperenses<span id="ref_44"><a href="#note_44">[44]</a></span>, the Caurenses<span id="ref_45"><a href="#note_45">[45]</a></span>, the Colarni, the Cibilitani, theConcordienses<span id="ref_46"><a href="#note_46">[46]</a></span>, the Elbocorii, the Interannienses, the Lan-<pb n="1367" />cienses<span id="ref_47"><a href="#note_47">[47]</a></span>, the Mirobrigenses, surnamed<span id="ref_48"><a href="#note_48">[48]</a></span> Celtici, the Medubrigenses<span id="ref_49"><a href="#note_49">[49]</a></span>, surnamed Plumbarii, the Ocelenses<span id="ref_50"><a href="#note_50">[50]</a></span> or Lancienses, the Turduli, also called Barduli, and the Tapori.Agrippa states, that Lusitania, with Asturia and Gall¾cia,is 540 miles in length, and 536 in breadth. The provinces of Spain, measured from the two extreme<span id="ref_51"><a href="#note_51">[51]</a></span> promontoriesof the Pyrenees, along the sea-line of the entire coast, arethought to be 3922 miles in circumference; while somewriters make them to be but 2600.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In a great degree corresponding with modern Portugal, except that the latter includes the tract of country between the Minho and Douro.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">To distinguish them from the nation of the same name sprung from them, and occupying the Farther Spain.

He mentions a promontory called Artabrum as the headland <hi rend="ital">at the N. W. extremity of Spain;</hi> the coast on the one side of it looking to the north and the Gallic Ocean, on the other to the west and the Atlantic Ocean. But he considers this promontory to be the west <hi rend="ital">headland of the estuary of the Tagus,</hi> and adds, that some called it <hi rend="ital">Magnum Promontorium,</hi> or the "Great Promontory," and others Olisiponense, from the city of Olisipo, or Lisbon. He assigns, in fact, all the west coast of Spain, down to the mouth of the Tagus, to the north coast, and, instead of being led to detect his error by the resemblance of name between his Artabrum Promontorium and his Arrotreb¾ (the Artabri of his predecessors, Strabo and Mela), he perversely finds fault with those who had placed above the promontory Artabrum, a people of the same name who never were there.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">On the site of which the present city of Lisbon stands.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See note <hi rend="super">18</hi> in the preceding page.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See note<hi rend="super">18</hi>.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See note<hi rend="super">13</hi> in the preceding page.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Among these is Pomponius Mela, who confounds the river Limia, mentioned in the last chapter, with the ®minius, or Agueda.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now the river Mondego.</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxxiii. c. 21.</p><p><span id="note_17"><a href="#ref_17">17. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Cape St. Vincent.</p><p><span id="note_18"><a href="#ref_18">18. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny continues his error here, in taking part of the western side of Spain for the north, and part of the southern coast for the western.</p><p><span id="note_19"><a href="#ref_19">19. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">B. iii. c. 2.</p><p><span id="note_20"><a href="#ref_20">20. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">With the Vettones, situate in the province of the Alentejo.
