It is a well-known fact, that this country is dividedinto prefectures, called "Strategies," some of which singlyformed a kingdom in former times; they are one hundred<pb n="2020" />and twenty in number, with barbarous and uncouth names.<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>On the east, it is bounded, though not immediately, by theCeraunian Mountains and the district of Adiabene. Thespace that intervenes is occupied by the Sopheni, beyondwhom is the chain of mountains,<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> and then beyond them theinhabitants of Adiabene. Dwelling in the valleys adjoiningto Armenia are the Menobardi and the Moscheni. The Tigrisand inaccessible mountains surround Adiabene. To the left<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>of it is the territory of the Medi, and in the distance is seenthe Caspian Sea; which, as we shall state in the proper place,receives its waters from the ocean,<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> and is wholly surroundedby the Caucasian Mountains. The inhabitants upon the confines of Armenia shall now be treated of.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This river is said by Ammianus to have taken its name from Cyrus.It appears, however, to have been a not uncommon name of the rivers ofPersia.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is probable that these rivers take their rise near each other, but itis not improbable that the intervening distance mentioned in the presentpassage is much too small.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hardouin thinks that this is Neo-C¾sarea, mentioned as having beenbuilt on the banks of the Euphrates.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called Ezaz, according to D'Anville. Parisot suggests that itought to be Gaza or Gazaca, probably a colony of Median Gaza, nowTauris.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Originally called Tephrice. It stood on the river Lycus, and not farfrom the sources of the Halys, having been founded by Pompey, where hegained his first victory over Mithridates, whence its name, the "City ofVictory." The modern Enderez or Devrigni, probably marks its site.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ritter places it in Sophene, the modern Kharpat, and considers thatit may be represented by the modern Sert, the Tigranocerta of D'Anville.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The capital of Sophene, one of the districts of Armenia. St. Martinthinks that this was the ancient heathen name of the city of Martyropolis,but Ritter shows that such cannot be the case. It was called by theSyrians Kortbest; its present name is Kharput.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Generally supposed, by D'Anville and other modern geographers, tobe represented by the ruins seen at Sert. It was the later capital of Armenia,built by Tigranes.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The ancient capital of Armenia. Hannibal, who took refuge at thecourt of Artaxias when Antiochus was no longer able to afford him protection, superintended the building of it. Some ruins, called Takt Tiridate,or Throne of Tiridates, near the junction of the Aras and the Zengue,were formerly supposed to represent Artaxata, but Colonel Monteith hasfixed the site at a bend in the river lower down, at the bottom of whichwere the ruins of a bridge of Greek or Roman architecture.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A fortress in Lesser Armenia, upon the Euphrates, seventy-five milesfrom Zimara, as mentioned in B. v. c. 20. It has been identified with themodern ferry and lead mines of Kebban Ma'den, the points where the KaraSu is joined by the Murad Cha•, 270 miles from its source</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Justin makes it only <date value="1100" authname="1100">1100</date>, and that estimate appears to be several hundreds too much.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">81 A country lying to the north of Armenia.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We find in Strabo the names of some of them mentioned, such asSophene, Acilisene, Gorgodylene, Sacassene, Gorgarene, Phanene, Comisene, Orchestene, Chorsene, Cambysene, Odomantis, &amp;c.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Ceraunian Mountains. Parisot remarks that in this description,Pliny, notwithstanding his previous professions, does not appear to havemade any very great use of the list drawn up by Corbulo.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">That is, looking towards the south.</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Septentrional Ocean, with which the ancients imagined that thenorthern part of the Caspian Sea is connected. See c. 15.</p></body>
