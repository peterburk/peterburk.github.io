<div2 type="chapter" n="42" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 42.—WILD AND CULTIVATED ASPARAGUS.</head><p>Of all the garden plants, asparagus is the one that requiresthe most delicate attention in its cultivation. We have already<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>spoken at considerable length of its origin, when treating ofthe wild plants, and have mentioned that Cato<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> recommendsit to be grown in reed-beds. There is another kind, again, ofa more uncultivated nature than the garden asparagus, but lesspungent than corruda;<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> it grows upon the mountains in different countries, and the plains of Upper Germany are quitefull of it, so much so, indeed, that it was a not unhappy remarkof Tiberius Cæsar, that a weed grows there which bears a remarkably strong resemblance to asparagus. That which growsspontaneously upon the island of Nesis, off the coast of Campania, is looked upon as being by far the best of all.</p><p>Garden asparagus is reproduced from roots,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> the fibres ofwhich are exceedingly numerous, and penetrate to a considerable depth. When it first puts forth its shoots, it is green;these in time lengthen out into stalks, which afterwards throw<pb n="4189" />out streaked branches from the head: asparagus admits, also,of being grown from seed.</p><p>Cato<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> has treated of no subject with greater care than this,the last Chapter of his work being devoted to it, from whichwe may conclude that it was quite new to him, and a subjectwhich had only very recently occupied his attention. He recommends that the ground prepared for it should be a moist ordense soil, the seed being set at intervals of half a foot everyway, to avoid treading upon the heads; the seed, he says,should be put two or three into each hole, these being madewith the dibble as the line runs—for in his day, it should beremembered, asparagus was only grown from seed—this beingdone about the vernal equinox. It requires, he adds, to beabundantly manured, and to be kept well hoed, due care beingtaken not to pull up the young plants along with the weeds.The first year, he says, the plants must be protected from theseverity of the winter with a covering of straw, care beingtaken to uncover them in the spring, and to hoe and stub upthe ground about them. In the spring of the third year, theplants must be set fire to, and the earlier the period at whichthe fire is applied, the better they will thrive. Hence it is,that as reed-beds<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> grow all the more rapidly after being fired,asparagus is found to be a crop remarkably well suited forgrowing with them. The same author recommends, however,that asparagus should not be hoed before the plants have madetheir appearance above-ground, for fear of disturbing the roots;and he says that in gathering the heads, they should be cutclose to the root, and not broken off at the surface, a methodwhich is sure to make them run to stalk and die. They shouldbe cut, he says, until they are left to run to seed, and after theseed is ripe, in spring they must be fired, care being taken, assoon as they appear again, to hoe and manure them as before.After eight or nine years, he says, when the plants have become old, they must be renewed, after digging and manuringthe ground, by replanting the roots at intervals of a foot, carebeing taken to employ sheep's dung more particularly for thepurpose, other kinds of manure being apt to produce weeds.</p><p>No method of cultivating this plant that has since been triedhas been found more eligible than this, with the sole exceptionthat the seed is now sown about the ides of February, by laying<pb n="4190" />it in heaps in small trenches, after steeping it a considerabletime in manure; the result of which is that the roots becomematted, and form into spongy tufts, which are planted out atintervals of a foot after the autumnal equinox, the plants continuing to be productive so long as ten years even. There isno soil more favourable to the growth of asparagus, than thatof the gardens of Ravenna.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span></p><p>We have already<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> spoken of the corruda, by which term Imean the wild asparagus, by the Greeks called "orminos," or"myacanthos," as well as by other names. I find it stated, thatif rams' horns are pounded, and then buried in the ground,asparagus will come up.<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. xvi. c. 67.
