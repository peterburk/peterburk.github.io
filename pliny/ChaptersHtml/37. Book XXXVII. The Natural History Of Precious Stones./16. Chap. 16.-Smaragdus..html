The third rank, for many reasons, has been given to<pb n="6409" />the smaragdus.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> Indeed there is no stone, the colour of whichis more delightful to the eye; for whereas the sight fixes itselfwith avidity upon the green<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> grass and the foliage of the trees,we have all the more pleasure in looking upon the smaragdus,there being no green in existence of a more intense colour<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>than this. And then, besides, of all the precious stones, this isthe only one that feeds the sight without satiating it. Evenwhen the vision has been fatigued with intently viewing otherobjects, it is refreshed by being turned upon this stone; andlapidaries know of nothing that is more gratefully soothing tothe eyes, its soft green tints being wonderfully adapted forassuaging lassitude, when felt in those organs.</p><p>And then, besides, when viewed from a distance, these stonesappear all the larger to the sight, reflecting as they do, theirgreen hues upon the circumambient air. Neither sunshine,shade, nor artificial light effects any change in their appearance;they have always a softened and graduated brilliancy; andtransmitting the light with facility, they allow the vision topenetrate their interior; a property which is so pleasing, also,with reference to water. In form they are mostly concave, soas to re-unite the rays of light and the powers of vision:and hence it is, that it is so universally agreed upon amongmankind to respect these stones, and to forbid their surface<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>to be engraved. In the case, however, of the stones of Scythiaand Egypt, their hardness is such, that it would be quite impossibleto penetrate them. When the surface of the smaragdusis flat, it reflects the image of objects in the same manner asa mirror. The Emperor Nero used to view<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> the combats ofthe gladiators upon a smaragdus.<pb n="6410" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">At the present day the ruby is next in esteem to the diamond.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Chapter 54, <hi rend="ital">et seq.</hi></p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Emerald, and various other green precious stones, were includedunder this name.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Virentes" seems a very preferable reading to "silentes," as givenby the Bamberg MS.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The emerald is supposed to derive this colour from a minute portionof oxide of chrome.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Engraved emeralds are but seldom found among collections of ancientgems.

Inv. Vol. II. p. 67. <hi rend="ital">Bohn's Edition.</hi> It hasalso been suggested, with reference to this passage, that Nero was shortsighted,and that this emerald was formed like a concave lens. The passage,however, will hardly support such a construction. Ajasson thinks that itmust have been a Dioptase or Siberian emerald; or else a green Corundum.</p></body>
