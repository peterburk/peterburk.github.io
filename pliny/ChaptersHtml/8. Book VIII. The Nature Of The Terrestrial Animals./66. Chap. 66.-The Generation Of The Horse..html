The connection takesplace at the vernal equinox, and generally in both sexes, atthe age of two years; but the colt is much stronger when theparents are three years old. The males are capable of cover-<pb n="2321" />ing up to the thirty-third year, and it is not till after the twentieth that they are taken for this purpose from the Circus.At Opus,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> it is said, a horse served as a stallion until hisfortieth year; though he required some assistance in raising thefore part of the body. There are few animals, however, inwhich the generative powers are so limited, for which reasonit is only admitted to the female at certain intervals;<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> indeed itcannot cover as many as fifteen times in the course of one year.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>The sexual passion of the mare is extinguished by cropping hermane; she is capable of bearing every year up to the fortieth.We have an account of a horse having lived to its seventy-fifthyear. The mare brings forth standing upright, and is attached,beyond all other animals, to her offspring. The horse is bornwith a poisonous substance on its forehead, known as hippomanes,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> and used in love philtres; it is the size of a fig, and ofa black colour; the mother devours it immediately on the birthof the foal, and until she has done so, she will not suckle it.When this substance can be rescued from the mother, it hasthe property of rendering the animal quite frantic by thesmell. If a foal has lost its mother, the other mares in theherd that have young, will take charge of the orphan. Itis said that the young of this animal cannot touch the earthwith the mouth for the first three days after its birth. Themore spirited a horse is, the deeper does it plunge its nose intothe water while drinking. The Scythians prefer mares forthe purposes of war, because they can pass their urine withoutstopping in their career.<pb n="2322" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The materials of this chapter appear to have been principally takenfrom Aristotle, Varro, and Columella—B.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. iv. c. 12.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Varro, <hi rend="ital">ubi supra,</hi> gives considerably different directions on this point;he says, "Intercourse is to be allowed, at the proper season of the year,twice a day, morning and evening."</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This sentence in Columella, <hi rend="ital">ubi supra,</hi> seems to illustrate the meaning,which is somewhat obscure "Veruntamen nec minus quam quindecim, necplures quam viginti, unus debet implere"—"One male ought to be coupledwith not more than twenty females, nor less than fifteen."</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier states, that the hippomanes is a concretion occasionally foundin the liquor amnii of the mare, and which it devours, from the same kindof instinctive feeling which causes quadrupeds generally to devour the afterbirth. He remarks, however, that this can have no connection with theattachment which the mother bears to her offspring; Ajasson, vol. vi. p.459; Lemaire, vol. iii. p. 495. The hippomanes is said to have been employed by the sorceresses of antiquity, as an ingredient in their amatory potions. See Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 24, and Ælian, Anim. Nat.B. xiv. c. 18.—B. See also B. xxviii. c. 11.</p></body>
