It isdetergent, astringent, heating, and corrosive, but is most remarkablefor its septic properties. Applied topically withvinegar, it is curative of alopecy. It is also employed as aningredient in ophthalmic preparations. Used with honey, itcleanses the fauces and makes the voice more clear and harmonious.Taken with the food, in combination with turpentine,it is a pleasant cure for cough and asthma. In the formof a fumigation also, with cedar, it has a remedial effect uponthose complaints.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Realgar of the moderns, red orpiment, or red sulphuret of arsenic.Pliny has in numerous places spoken of it as a remedy for certain morbidstates both of animals and vegetables, B. xvii. c. 47, B. xxiii. c. 13, B.xxv. c. 22, and B. xxviii. c. 62, but he has not previously given any accountof its origin and composition.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Dioscorides, B. v. c. 122, informs us, with respect to this effect of sandarach,that it was burned in combination with resin, and that the smokewas inhaled through a tube.ÑB.</p></body>
