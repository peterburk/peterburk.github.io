<div2 type="chapter" n="15" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 15. (13.)ÑTHOSE WHICH ARE COVERED WITH HAIR, OR HAVE NONE, AND HOW THEY BRING FORTH. SEA-CALVES, OR PHOC®.</head><p>Those aquatic animals which are covered with hair are viviparous, such, for instance, as the pristis, the bal¾na,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and thesea-calf. This last brings forth its young on land, and, like thesheep, produces an after-birth. In coupling, they adhereafter the manner of the canine species; the female sometimes produces even more than two, and rears her young atthe breast. She does not take them down to the sea until thetwelfth day, and after that time makes them become used toit by degrees.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> These animals are killed with the greatest dif-<pb n="2381" />ficulty, unless the head is cut off at once. They make a noisewhich sounds like lowing, whence their name of "sea-calf."They are susceptible, however, of training, and with their voice,as well as by gestures, can be taught to salute the public; whencalled by their name, they answer with a discordant kind ofgrunt.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> No animal has a deeper sleep<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> than this; on dryland it creeps along as though on feet, by the aid of what ituses as fins when in the sea. Its skin, even when separated from the body, is said to retain a certain sensitive sympathy with the sea, and at the reflux<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> of the tide, the hair onit always rises upright: in addition to which, it is said thatthere is in the right fin a certain soporiferous influence, andthat, if placed under the head, it induces sleep.</p><p>(14.) There are only two animals without hair that areviviparous, the dolphin and the viper.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier remarks, how very inappropriately Pliny places the pristis(probably the saw-fish) and the bal¾na among the animals that arecovered with hair. Aristotle, he says, in his Hist. Anim. B. vi. c. 12,goes so far as to say that the pristis and the ox-fish (a kind of ray orthorn-back, probably) bring forth their young like the bal¾na and thedolphin, but does not go beyond that. Cuvier says also, that what is herestated of the sea-calf is in general correct, except the statements as to theproperties of its skin and its right fin, the stories relative to which are, ofcourse, neither more nor less than fabulous.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. vi. c. 11, states to the like effect.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Fremitu." From their lowing noise, the French have also calledthese animals "veaux de mer," and we call them "sea-calvs." ®lian,Hist. Anim. B. xii. c. 56, and Diodorus Siculus, B. iii., also speak of training the sea-calf. Hardouin says that Lopez de Gomara, one of the morerecent writers on Mexico, in his day, had given an account of an Indiansea-calf, or manati, as it was called by the natives, that had become quitetame, and answered readily to its name; and that, although not very large,it was able to bear ten men on its back. He also tells us of a much moreextraordinary one, which Aldrovandus says he himself had seen at Bologna, which would give a cheer (vocem ederet) for the Christian princes whenasked, but would refuse to do so for the Turks; just, Hardouin says, aswe see dogs bark, and monkeys grin and jump, at the mention of a particular name.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Oppian, Haliut. B. i. 1. 408, mentions this fact, and Juvenal, Sat.iii. 1. 238, alludes to it: "Would break the slumbers of Drusus and ofsea-calves."</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This assertion, though untrue, no doubt, as to sympathy with the tides,is in some degree supported by the statement of Rondelet, B. xvi. c. 6,who says that he had often perceived changes in the wind and weatherprognosticated by the hide of this animal; for that when a south windwas about to blow, the hair would stand erect, while when a north windwas on the point of arising, it would lie so flat that you would hardlyknow that there was any hair on the surface.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hardouin remarks, that Pliny classes the viper probably among theaquatic animals, either because it was said to couple with the mur¾na, orelse because it has a womb not unlike that of the cartilaginous fishes.</p></body>
