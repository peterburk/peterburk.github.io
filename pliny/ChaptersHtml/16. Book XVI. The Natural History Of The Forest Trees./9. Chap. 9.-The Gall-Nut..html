The gallnut of the hemeris<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> is considered the choicest of all, and thebest adapted for the preparation of leather: that of the latifolia closely resembles it, but is somewhat lighter, and not byany means so highly approved. This last tree produces theblack gall-nut also—for there are two varieties of it—this lastbeing deemed preferable for dyeing wool.</p><p>(7.) The gall-nut begins to grow just as the sun is leavingthe sign of Gemini,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and always bursts forth in its entirety in asingle night.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> The white variety grows, too, in a single day, butif the heat happens to overtake it, it shrinks immediately, andnever arrives at its proper size, which is about that of a bean.The black gall-nut will remain green for a longer period, andsometimes attains the size of an apple<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> even. The best kind isthat which comes from Commagene,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> and the most inferiorare those produced by the robur: it may easily be tested bymeans of certain holes in it which admit of the passage of thelight.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This assertion is perhaps too general; gall-nuts are produced in verysmall quantities by the holm-oak.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A variety of the Quercus racemosa, which produces the green gallnut of Aleppo, considered in modern, as in ancient, times the choicest inquality.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Theophrastus says the end of June.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Its growth, in reality, is not so rapid as this.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Such a thing is never seen at the present day.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In Syria.
