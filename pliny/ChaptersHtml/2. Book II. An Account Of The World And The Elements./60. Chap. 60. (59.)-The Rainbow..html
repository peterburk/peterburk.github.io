(59.)ÑTHE RAINBOW.</head><p>What we name Rainbows frequently occur, and are notconsidered either wonderful or ominous; for they do notpredict, with certainty, either rain or fair weather. It isobvious, that the rays of the sun, being projected upon ahollow cloud, the light is thrown back to the sun and is re-<pb n="1090" />fracted<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>, and that the variety of colours is produced by amixture of clouds, air, and fire<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>. The rainbow is certainlynever produced except in the part opposite to the sun, nor evenin any other form except that of a semicircle. Nor are theyever formed at night, although Aristotle asserts that they aresometimes seen at that time; he acknowledges, however, thatit can only be on the 14th day of the moon<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>. They are seenin the winter the most frequently, when the days are shortening,after the autumnal equinox<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>. They are not seen whenthe days increase again, after the vernal equinox, nor on thelongest days, about the summer solstice, but frequently atthe winter solstice, when the days are the shortest. Whenthe sun is low they are high, and when the sun is high theyare low; they are smaller when in the east or west, but arespread out wider; in the south they are small, but of agreater span. In the summer they are not seen at noon,but after the autumnal equinox at any hour: there are nevermore than two seen at once,</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Manifestum est, radium Solis immissum cav¾ nubi, repulsa acie inSolem, refringi."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle treats of the Rainbow much in detail, principally in hisMeteor. iii. 2, 3, 4, and 5, where he gives an account of the ph¾nomena,which is, for the most part, correct, and attempts to form a theory forthem; see especially cap. 4. p. 577 <hi rend="ital">et seq.</hi> In the treatise De Mundo healso refers to the same subject, and briefly sums up his doctrine with thefollowing remark: "arcus est species segmenti solaris vel lunaris, edita innube humida, et cava, et perpetua; quam velut in speculo intuemur, imagine relata in speciem circularis ambitižs." cap. 4. p. 607. Seneca alsotreats very fully on the phenomena and theory of the Rainbow, in hisNat. Qu¾st. i. 3Ð8.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot"><hi rend="ital">Vide supra,</hi> also Meteor. iii. 2, and Seneca, Nat.

See also Seneca, Nat.Qu¾st. i. 8. p. 692.</p></body>
