Varro gives us the following statement as to the winesthat were held in the highest esteem at table in his day:"L. Lucullus, when a boy, never saw an entertainment at hisfather's house, however sumptuous it might be, at which Greek<pb n="3255" />wine was handed round more than once during the repast:whereas he himself, when he returned from Asia, distributedas a largess among the people more than a hundred thousandcongiaria<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> of the same wine. C. Sentius, whom we have seenPr¾tor, used to say that Chian wine never entered his houseuntil his physician prescribed it to him for the cardiac<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> disease. On the other hand, Hortensius left ten thousand casksof it to his heir." Such is the statement made by Varro.</p><p>(15.) And besides, is it not a well-known fact that C¾sar,when Dictator, at the banquet given on the occasion of histriumph, allotted to each table an amphora of Falernian and acadus of Chian? On the occasion, too, of his triumph for hisvictories in Spain, he put before the guests both Chian as wellas Falernian; and again, at the banquet given on his thirdconsulship,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> he gave Falernian, Chian, Lesbian, and Marmertine; indeed, it is generally agreed that this was the firstoccasion on which four different kinds of wine were served attable. It was after this, then, that all the other sorts cameinto such very high repute, somewhere about the year of theCity 700.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Vessels containing a congius, or the eighth of an amphora, nearly sixpints English.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">As to this malady, see B. xi. c. 71.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">B.C. <date value="-46" authname="-46">46</date>.</p></body>
