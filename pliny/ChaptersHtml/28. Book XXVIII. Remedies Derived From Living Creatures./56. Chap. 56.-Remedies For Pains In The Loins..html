The magicians, too,have added to this branch of medicine their own fancifuldevices. In the first place of all, madness in he-goats, theysay, may be effectually calmed by stroking the beard; and ifthe beard is cut off, the goat will never stray to another flock,<pb n="5345" /></p><p>To the above composition they add goats' dung, and recommend it to be held in the hollow of the hand, as hot as possible,a greased linen cloth being placed beneath, and care beingtaken to hold it in the right hand if the pain is on the leftside, and in the left hand if the pain is on the right. Theyrecommend also that the dung employed for this purpose shouldbe taken up on the point of a needle made of copper. Themode of treatment is, for the patient to hold the mixture inhis hand till the heat is felt to have penetrated to the loins,after which the hand is rubbed with a pounded leek, and theloins with the same dung annealed with honey. They prescribealso for the same malady the testes of a hare, to be eaten by thepatient. In cases of sciatica they are for applying cow-dungwarmed upon hot ashes in leaves: and for pains in the kidneysthey recommend a hare's kidneys to be swallowed raw, orperhaps boiled, but without letting them be touched by theteeth. If a person carries about him the pastern-bone of ahare, he will never be troubled with pains in the bowels,they say.</p></div2></body>
