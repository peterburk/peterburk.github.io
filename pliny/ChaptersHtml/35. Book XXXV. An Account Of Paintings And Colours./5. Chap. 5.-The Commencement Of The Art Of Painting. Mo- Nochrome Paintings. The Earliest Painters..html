THE EARLIEST PAINTERS.</head><p>We have no certain knowledge as to the commencement ofthe art of painting, nor does this enquiry fall under our consideration.The Egyptians assert that it was invented amongthemselves, six thousand years before it passed into Greece; avain boast, it is very evident.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> As to the Greeks, some saythat it was invented at Sicyon, others at Corinth; but theyall agree that it originated in tracing lines round the humanshadow.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> The first stage of the art, they say, was this, the<pb n="6229" />second stage being the employment of single colours; a processknown as "monochromaton,"<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> after it had become morecomplicated, and which is still in use at the present day.The invention of line-drawing has been assigned to Philocles,the Egyptian, or to Cleanthes<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> of Corinth. The firstwho practised this line-drawing were Aridices, the Corinthian,and Telephanes, the Sicyonian, artists who, without makinguse of any colours, shaded the interior of the outline bydrawing lines;<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> hence, it was the custom with them to add tothe picture the name of the person represented. Ecphantus,the Corinthian, was the first to employ colours upon thesepictures, made, it is said, of broken earthenware, reduced topowder. We shall show on a future<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> occasion, that it was adifferent artist of the same name, who, according to CorneliusNepos, came to Italy with Demaratus, the father of the Romanking, Tarquinius Priscus, on his flight from Corinth to escapethe violence of the tyrant Cypselus.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This period for the invention of painting by the Egyptians is evidentlyincorrect; but still there is sufficient reason for concluding thatthere now exist specimens of Egyptian art, which were in existence previousto the time of the earliest Grecian painters of whom we have anycertain account.—B.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">All the ancients who have treated of the history of the art agree,that the first attempt at what may be considered the formation of a picture, consisted in tracing the shadow of a human head or some other objecton the wall, the interior being filled up with one uniform shade ofcolour.—B.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From the Greek <foreign lang="greek">monoxrw/maton</foreign> "single colouring."—B.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He is mentioned also by Athenagoras, Strabo, and Athenæus.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Called "graphis," by the Greeks, and somewhat similar, probably, toour pen and ink drawings.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In Chapter 43 of this Book.—B.</p></body>
