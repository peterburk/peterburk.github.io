A TREE ATROME FIVE HUNDRED YEARS OLD.</head><p>The life of some trees might really be looked upon as ofinfinite<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> duration, if we only think of the dense wilds and<pb n="3430" />inaccessible forests in some parts of the world. In relation,however, to those, the date of which is still within the memory of man, there are some olive-trees still in existence atLiternum, which were planted by the hand of the firstScipio Africanus, as also a myrtle there of extraordinary size;beneath them there is a grotto, in which, it is said, a dragonkeeps watch over that hero's shade. There is a lotus<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> treein the open space before the Temple of Lucina at Rome, whichwas built in the year of the City 379, a year in which therepublic had no<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> magistrates. How much older the tree isthan the temple, is a matter of doubt; but that it is older isquite certain, for it was from that same grove that the goddessLucina<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> derived her name; the tree in question is now aboutfour hundred and fifty years old. The lotus tree, which isknown as the Capillata, is still older than this, though it isuncertain what is its age; it received that name from thecircumstance of the Vestal Virgins suspending locks of theirhair<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> from it.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">According to Adanson, the baobab will live for more than six thousand years.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Celtis australis of Linnæus.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In consequence of the disputes between the patricians and plebeians.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Thus deriving Lucina from "lucus," a grove.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Capillos.</p></body>
