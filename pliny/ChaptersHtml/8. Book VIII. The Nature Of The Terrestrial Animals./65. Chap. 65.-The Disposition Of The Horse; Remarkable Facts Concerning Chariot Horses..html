<div2 type="chapter" n="65" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 65.ÑTHE DISPOSITION OF THE HORSE; REMARKABLE FACTSCONCERNING CHARIOT HORSES.</head><p>These animals possess an intelligence which exceeds all description.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> Those who have to use the javelin are wellaware how the horse, by its exertions and the supple movements of its body, aids the rider in any difficulty he may havein throwing his weapon. They will even present to theirmaster the weapons collected on the ground. The horses too,that are yoked to the chariots in the Circus, beyond a doubt,display remarkable proofs how sensible they are to encouragement and to glory. In the Secular games, which were celebrated in the Circus, under the Emperor Claudius, when thecharioteer Corax, who belonged to the white party,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> wasthrown from his place at the starting-post, his horses took thelead and kept it, opposing the other chariots, overturning them,and doing every thing against the other competitors that couldhave been done, had they been guided by the most skilfulcharioteer; and while we quite blushed to behold the skill ofman excelled by that of the horse, they arrived at the goal,after going over the whole of the prescribed course. Ourancestors considered it as a still more remarkable portent, that<pb n="2320" />when a charioteer had been thrown from his place, in the plebeian games of the Circus,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> the horses ran to the Capitol, justas if he had been standing in the car, and went three timesround the temple there. But what is the greatest prodigy of all,is the fact that the horses of Ratumenna came from Veii toRome, with the palm branch and chaplet, he himself havingfallen from his chariot, after having gained the victory; fromwhich circumstance the Ratumennian gate derived its name.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span></p><p>When the Sarmat¾ are about to undertake a long journey,they prepare their horses for it, by making them fast theday before, during which they give them but little to drink;by these means they are enabled to travel on horseback, without stopping, for one hundred and fifty miles. Some horsesare known to live fifty years; but the females are not so long-lived.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> These last come to their full growth at the fifth year,the males a year later. The poet Virgil has very beautifullydescribed the points which ought more especially to be lookedfor, as constituting the perfection of a horse;<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> I myself havealso treated of the same subject, in my work<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> on the Use of theJavelin by Cavalry, and I find that pretty nearly all writers areagreed respecting them.<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> The points requisite for the Circusare somewhat different, however; and while horses are putin training for other purposes at only two years old, they arenot admitted to the contests of the Circus before their fifth year.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hardouin refers to the works of Busbequius, in which we meet withnearly the same account of the sagacity of the horse, as in Pliny; Lemaire, iii. 489.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">As already mentioned in the Note to c. 54 of the last Book, therewere four parties or factions of the charioteers who were named from thecolour of their dress.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The games of the Circus were divided into the Patrician and the Plebeian;the first being conducted by generals, consuls, and the cuiule ¾dilcs,the latter by the ¾dles of the people.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Related somewhat more at large by Plutarch, in his Life of Publicola.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Many of these particulars are from Aristotle, Hist.
