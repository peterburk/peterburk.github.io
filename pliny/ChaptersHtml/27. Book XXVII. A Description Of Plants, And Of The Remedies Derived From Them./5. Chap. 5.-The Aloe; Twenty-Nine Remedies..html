<div2 type="chapter" n="5" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 5.—THE ALOE; TWENTY-NINE REMEDIES.</head><p>The aloe<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> bears a resemblance to the squill, except that it islarger, and has more substantial leaves, with streaks runningobliquely. The stem is tender, red in the middle, and notunlike that of the anthericus.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> It has a single root, which runsstraight downwards, like a stake driven into the ground; itssmell is powerful, and it has a bitter taste. The most esteemedaloes are those imported from India, but it grows in the Asiaticprovinces<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> as well. This last kind, however, is never used,except that the leaves are applied fresh to wounds; indeed,these leaves, as well as the juice, are glutinous to a marvellousdegree, and it is for this property that it is grown in vessels ofa conical form, in the same way as the greater Aizoüm.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> Somepersons make incisions in the stem to obtain the juice, beforethe seed is ripe, while others, again, make them in the leavesas well. Tearlike drops are also found adhering to it, whichexude spontaneously: hence it is that some recommend thatthe place should be paved where it is grown, to prevent thisjuice from being absorbed.</p><p>Some authors have stated, that there is found in Judæa,beyond Hierosolyma, a mineral<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> aloe, but that it is inferior tothe other kinds, being of a darker colour and more humid thanany of the rest. Aloes<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> of the finest quality should beunctuous and shining, of a red colour, brittle, compact, likethe substance of liver, and easily liquefied. That which ishard and black should be rejected; the same, too, when it ismixed with sand or adulterated with gum and acacia, a fraudwhich may be easily detected by the taste.</p><p>This plant is of an astringent nature, binding, and slightlycalorific. It is employed for numerous purposes, but principallyas a purgative,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> it being almost the only one of all the medica-<pb n="5223" />ments which produce that effect, that is at the same time agood stomachic, and does not exercise the slightest noxiousinfluence upon the stomach. It is taken in doses of onedrachma, and, in cases of derangement of the stomach, it isadministered two or three times a day, in the proportion ofone spoonful to two cyathi of warm or cold water, at intervals,according to the nature of the emergency. As a purgative itis mostly taken in doses of three drachmæ; and it operatesstill more efficaciously, if food is eaten directly afterwards.Used with astringent wine, it prevents<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> the hair from fallingoff, the head being rubbed with it the contrary way of thehair, in the sun. Applied to the temples and forehead withrose oil and vinegar, or used as an infusion, in a more dilutedform, it allays head-ache. It is generally agreed that it isremedial for all diseases<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> of the eyes, but more particularly forprurigo and scaly eruptions of the eye-lids; as also for marksand bruises, applied in combination with honey, Pontic honeyin particular.</p><p>It is employed, also, for affections of the tonsillary glands andgums, for all ulcerations of the mouth, and for spitting ofblood, if not in excess—the proper dose being one drachma,taken in water or else vinegar. Used by itself, or in combinationwith vinegar, it arrests hæmorrhage, whether proceeding frontwounds or from other causes. In addition to these properties, itis extremely efficacious for the cure of wounds, producingcicatrization very rapidly: it is sprinkled also upon ulcerationsof the male organs, and is applied to condylomata and chapsof the fundament, either in common wine, raisin wine, or byitself in a dry state, according as a mollifying or restrictivetreatment is required. It has the effect, also, of gentlyarresting hæmorrhoidal bleeding, when in excess. In cases ofdysentery, it is used as an injection, and where the digestionis imperfect it is taken shortly after the evening meal. Forjaundice, it is administered in doses of three oboli, inwater. As a purgative for the bowels, it is taken in pills, withboiled honey or turpentine. It is good also for the removal ofhangnails. When employed in ophthalmic preparations, it isfirst washed, that the more gravelly portions of it may subside;<pb n="5224" />or else it is put over the fire in a pipkin, and stirred with afeather from time to time, that the whole of it may be equallywarmed.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The ancients probably included under this name several distinct speciesof the aloe.
