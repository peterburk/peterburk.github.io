(8.)—DOLPHINS.</head><p>The swiftest<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> not only of the sea animals, but of all animalswhatever, is the dolphin.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> He is more rapid in his move-<pb n="2370" />ments than a bird, more instantaneous than the flight of anarrow, and were it not for the fact that his mouth is situatemuch below his muzzle,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> almost, indeed, in the middle of thebelly, not a fish would be able to escape his pursuit. ButNature,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> in her prudence, has thrown certain impediments inhis way; for unless he turns, and throws himself on his back,he can seize nothing, and it is this circumstance more especially that gives proof of his extraordinary swiftness. For, ifpressed by hunger,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> he will follow a fish, as it flies down, tothe very bottom of the water, and then after holding his breaththus long, will dart again to the surface to respire, with thespeed of an arrow discharged from a bow; and often, on suchoccasions, he is known to leap out of the water with such abound, as to fly right over the sails<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> of a ship.</p><p>Dolphins generally go in couples; the females bring forththeir young in the tenth month, during the summer season,sometimes two in number.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> They suckle their young at theteat like the balæna, and even carry them during the weakness of infancy; in addition to which, long after they aregrown up, they accompany them, so great is their affection fortheir progeny. The young ones grow very speedily, and inten years are supposed to arrive at their full size. The dol-<pb n="2371" />phin lives thirty years; a fact that has been ascertained fromcutting marks<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> on the tail, by way of experiment. It conceals itself for thirty days, at about the rising of the Dog-star,and hides itself so effectually, that it is not known whither itgoes; a thing that is more surprising still, if it is unable torespire under water. Dolphins are in the habit of dartingupon the shore, for some reason or other, it is not known<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>what. They do not die the moment that they touch the dryland, but will die much more speedily if the vent-hole is closed.The tongue, contrary to the nature of aquatic animals ingeneral, is moveable, being short and broad, not much unlikethat of the pig. Instead of a voice, they emit a moaningsound<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> similar to that made by a human being; the back isarched, and the nose turned up. For this reason<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> it is thatthey all recognize in a most surprising manner the name ofSimo, and prefer to be called by that rather than by any other.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle, Hist.

Thus, in his story in B. ix. c. 8, of the friendship conceived by a dolphin in Lake Lucrinus for a child at Baie, he takes care toremark that the dolphin, when taking the child on his back, concealed hisspines beneath his dorsal fin. I am of opinion, however, that I have recognized the fish which Seneca, Pliny, and even Aristotle have sometimesconfounded with the real dolphin, apparently because it had received thatname from certain fishermen, and these are my reasons for forming thisconclusion. In c. 7 of the Ninth Book, Pliny mingles with many facts thatreally do belong to the real dolphin, one trait which is quite foreign to it.It is so swift,' says he, 'that were it not for the fact that its mouth issituate much beneath its muzzle, almost, indeed, in the middle of its belly,not a fish would be able to escape its pursuit: in consequence of this, itcan only seize its prey by turning on its back.' This, it must be observed,is not one of those mistakes which we are to put down to Pliny's own account, and of which he has so many; for we find Aristotle as well, who hasso perfectly known and described the ordinary dolphin, attributing a mouthsimilarly situate to the dolphin and the cartilaginous animals. This fact,which is totally false as regards the real dolphin, is, in all probability, applicable to the alleged dolphin, whose back is mentioned as being armedwith spines. These three characteristics, a mouth situate very far beneath the nose, spines on the back, and power and swiftness sufficient toenable it to fight the crocodile, are only to be found united in certain ofthe genus 'Squalus,' such as the 'Squalus centrina,' and the 'Squalusspinax' of Linnæus."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 5. From this description Hardouinis induced to think that Rondelet and Aldrovandus are wrong in theirconclusions that it is the sea-hog, or porpoise, that is meant. Cuvier alsosays, that this description will not apply to the real dolphin, though it isstrictly applicable to the Squalus acanthias, Squalus ricinus, and others; tothe former of which also the spines or stings mentioned by Pliny appropriately belong; all the other characteristics, he says, which are here mentioned by Pliny, are applicable to the real dolphin, though in moderntimes it has never been brought to such a degree of tameness. Hence itis that some writers have supposed that Pliny is here speaking of the Trichechus manatus of Linnæus, by the French called "lamentin," by usthe "sea-cow." Cuvier says, that he should be inclined to be of the sameopinion, were it not for the fact that that animal does not frequent the coastsof the Mediterranean.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Copied literally from Aristotle, Hist.

Pintianus, following the similar account givenby Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. ix. c. 48, takes the words to mean "temere,""hap-hazard," "without any motive whatever." Ajasson says that it istheir eager pursuit of small fishes which sometimes betrays them into leapingon shore, and occasionally, the pain caused by attacks of parasitical sea-insects and other animals.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle, Hist.

Hardouin undertakes to explain their remarkable likingfor this name on other grounds, and says that when a song was sung, theywere charmed by the pronunciation of the word "Simo" every now andthen, the last syllable being drawn out at great length. Ajasson suggeststhat the only reason for which this name delighted them, was probably thesibilant or hissing sound made when it is frequently repeated.</p></body>
