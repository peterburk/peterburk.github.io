Passing out of theAmbracian Gulf into the Ionian Sea, we come to the coastof Leucadia, with the Promontory of Leucate<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>, and then theGulf and the peninsula of Leucadia<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>, which last was formerlycalled Neritis<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>. By the exertions of the inhabitants it wasonce cut off from the mainland, but was again joined to itby the vast bodies of sand accumulated through the actionof the winds. This spot is called Dioryctos<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>, and is threestadia in length: on the peninsula is the town of Leucas,formerly called Neritus<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>. We next come to Alyzia<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>, Stratos<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>, and Argos<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>, surnamed Amphilochian, cities of theAcarnanians: the river Acheloüs<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> flows from the heightsof Pindus, and, after separating Acarnania from Ætolia, isfast adding the island of Artemita<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> to the mainland by thecontinual deposits of earth which it brings down its stream.<pb n="1275" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This district probably occupied the present cantons of Vonitza andXeromeros. It was called Curetis from the Curetes, who are said to havecome from Ætolia and settled in Acarnania after their expulsion by Ætolusand his followers.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The modern Vonitza is supposed to stand on its site.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Leake places its site at Ai Vasili, where some ruins are to be seen.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"The city of Victory." Founded by Augustus on the spot where hehad pitched his camp before the battle of Actium.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called Capo Ducato or Capo tis Kiras. It is situate at theextremity of the island of Leucas, and opposite to Cephallenia.Sappho issaid to have leapt from this rock on finding her love for Phaonunrequited: the story however is devoid of all historicaltruth.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now the island of Santa Maura. It was originally a peninsula, andHomer speaks of it as such; but the Corinthians cut a canal through theisthmus and converted it into an island. After the canal had been chokedup for some time with sand, the Romans reopened it. It is at presentdry in some parts.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably from its town Nericus, mentioned by Homer.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From the Greek word <foreign lang="greek">diorukto\s,</foreign> a "foss" or "trench."</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It probably had this name from the circumstance of the inhabitantsof Nericus being removed thither by the Corinthians under Cypselus.The remains of Leucas, which was ravaged by the Romans B.C. <date value="-197" authname="-197">197</date>, arestill to be seen.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Its remains are still to be seen in the valley of Kandili, south ofVonitza.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pouqueville says that very extensive and perfect ruins of this placeare to be seen near the village of Lepenou.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This famous city was deserted on the foundation of Nicopolis byAugustus. The place of its site has been a subject of much dispute, butit is considered most probable that Leake has rightly suggested that theruins in the plain of Vlikha, at the village of Neokhori, are those of thiscity.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now the Aspropotamo.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">One of the group of the Echinades; small islands off the coast ofAcarnania, which are mentioned by Pliny, in C. 19 of the present Book.It is now quite united to the mainland.</p></body>
