Painters, too, havebeen known to go so far as to dig up half-charred bones<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> fromthe sepulchres for this purpose.</p><p>All these plans, however, are new-fangled and troublesome;for this substance may be prepared, in numerous ways, fromthe soot that is yielded by the combustion of resin or pitch;so much so, indeed, that manufactories have been built on theprinciple of not allowing an escape for the smoke evolved bythe process. The most esteemed black,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> however, that is madein this way, is prepared from the wood of the torch-pine.</p><p>It is adulterated by mixing it with the ordinary soot fromfurnaces and baths, a substance which is also employed for thepurpose of writing. Others, again, calcine dried wine-lees, andassure us that if the wine was originally of good quality fromwhich the colour is made, it will bear comparison with that ofindicum.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> Polygnotus and Micon, the most celebrated paintersof Athens, made their black from grape-husks, and called it"tryginon."<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> Apelles invented a method of preparing it fromburnt ivory, the name given to it being "elephantinon."</p><p>We have indicum also, a substance imported from India, thecomposition of which is at present unknown to me.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> Dyers,too, prepare an atramentum from the black inflorescence whichadheres to the brazen dye-pans. It is made also from logs oftorch-pine, burnt to charcoal and pounded in a mortar. The sæpia,too, has a wonderful property of secreting a black liquid;<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>but from this liquid no colour is prepared. The preparation ofevery kind of atramentum is completed by exposure to the sun;<pb n="6242" />the black, for writing, having an admixture of gum, and thatfor coating walls, an admixture of glue. Black pigment thathas been dissolved in vinegar is not easily effaced by washing.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Black colouring substance."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Carbones infectos." The reading is very doubtful. It may possiblymean "charred bones tainted with dirt." This would make an inferiorivory-black. The earth before-mentioned is considered by Ajassonto be a deuto-sulphate of copper, a solution of which, in gallic acid, isstill used for dyeing black. The water near copper-mines would very probablybe also highly impregnated with it. Beckmann considers these tohave been vitriolic products.
