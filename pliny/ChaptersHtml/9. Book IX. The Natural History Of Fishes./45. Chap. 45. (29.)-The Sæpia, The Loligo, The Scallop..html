(29.)—THE SÆPIA, THE LOLIGO, THE SCALLOP.</head><p>The loligo is also able to dart above the surface of the water,and the scallop does the same, just like an arrow as it were.In the sæpia,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> the male is parti-coloured, blacker than thefemale, and more courageous. If the female is struck with afish-spear, the male comes to her aid; but the female, the instant the male is struck, takes to flight. Both of them, assoon as ever they find themselves in danger of being caught,discharge<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> a kind of ink, which with them is in place ofblood,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and thus darkening the water, take to flight.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Plautus has a line in his Rudens, which shows that when the sæpiawas cooked for table, it was customary to take the eyes out. "Bid themknock out his eyes, just as the cooks do with the sæpia."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. iv. c. 2, states to a similar effect, as alsoÆlian, Hist. Anim. B. i. c. 34; Oppian, Halieut. B. iii. 1. 156.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This so-called ink, Cuvier says, is neither their blood nor their bile,but a liquid that is secreted in a bag peculiar to the animal. It is said,that it is from the juices of certain polypi of the Eastern seas, that thegenuine Indian or Chinese ink is made; but M. Abel Remusat assures usthat he has found nothing in the Chinese writers to confirm this conjecture.</p></body>
