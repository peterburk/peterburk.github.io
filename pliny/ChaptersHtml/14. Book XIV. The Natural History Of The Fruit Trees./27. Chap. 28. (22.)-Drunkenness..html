(22.)—DRUNKENNESS.</head><p>If any one will take the trouble duly to consider the matter,he will find that upon no one subject is the industry of mankept more constantly on the alert than upon the making of wine;as if Nature had not given us water as a beverage, the one, infact, of which all other animals make use. We, on the otherhand, even go so far as to make our very beasts of burdendrink<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> wine: so vast are our efforts, so vast our labours, andso boundless the cost which we thus lavish upon a liquidwhich deprives man of his reason and drives him to frenzyand to the commission of a thousand crimes! So great, however, are its attractions, that a great part of mankind are ofopinion that there is nothing else in life worth living for.Nay, what is even more than this, that we may be enabled toswallow all the more, we have adopted the plan of diminishingits strength by pressing it through<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> filters of cloth, and havedevised numerous inventions whereby to create an artificialthirst. To promote drinking, we find that even poisonousmixtures have been invented, and some men are known totake a dose of hemlock before they begin to drink, that theymay have the fear of death before them to make them taketheir wine:<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> others, again, take powdered pumice<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> for the<pb n="3271" />same purpose, and various other mixtures, which I shouldFeel quite ashamed any further to enlarge upon.</p><p>We see the more prudent among those who are given to thishabit have themselves parboiled in hot-baths, from whence theyare carried away half dead. Others there are, again, who cannot wait till they have got to the banqueting couch,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> no, notso much as till they have got their shirt on,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> but all nakedand panting as they are, the instant they leave the bath theyseize hold of large vessels filled with wine, to show of, as itwere, their mighty powers, and so gulp down the whole of thecontents only to vomit them up again the very next moment.This they will repeat, too, a second and even a third time,just as though they had only been begotten for the purpose ofwasting wine, and as if that liquor could not be thrown awaywithout having first passed through the human body. It isto encourage habits such as these that we have introduced theathletic exercises<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> of other countries, such as rolling in themud, for instance, and throwing the arms back to show off abrawny neck and chest. Of all these exercises, thirst, it issaid, is the chief and primary object.</p><p>And then, too, what vessels are employed for holding wine!carved all over with the representations of adulterous intrigues,as if, in fact, drunkenness itself was not sufficiently capable ofteaching us lessons of lustfulness. Thus we see wines quaffedout of impurities, and inebriety invited even by the hope of areward,—invited, did I say?—may the gods forgive me forsaying so, purchased outright. We find one person inducedto drink upon the condition that he shall have as much to eatas he has previously drunk, while another has to quaff asmany cups as he has thrown points on the dice. Then it isthat the roving, insatiate eyes are setting a price upon thematron's chastity; and yet, heavy as they are with wine, theydo not fail to betray their designs to her husband. Thenit is that all the secrets of the mind are revealed; one man isheard to disclose the provisions of his will, another lets fallsome expression of fatal import, and so fails to keep to himselfwords which will be sure to come home to him with a cut<pb n="3272" />throat. And how many a man has met his death in this fashion!Indeed, it has become quite a common proverb, that "in wine<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>there is truth."</p><p>Should he, however, fortunately escape all these dangers,the drunkard never beholds the rising sun, by which his lifeof drinking is made all the shorter. From wine, too, comesthat pallid hue,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> those drooping eyelids, those sore eyes, thosetremulous hands, unable to hold with steadiness the overflowing vessel, condign punishment in the shape of sleep agitated by Furies during the restless night, and, the supremereward of inebriety, those dreams of monstrous lustfulness andof forbidden delights. Then on the next day there is the breathreeking of the wine-cask, and a nearly total obliviousness ofeverything, from the annihilation of the powers of the memory.And this, too, is what they call "seizing the moments of life!<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>whereas, in reality, while other men lose the day that has gonebefore, the drinker has already lost the one that is to come.</p><p>They first began, in the reign of Tiberius Claudius, someforty years ago, to drink fasting, and to take whets of winebefore meals; an outlandish<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> fashion, however, and only patronized by physicians who wished to recommend themselvesby the introduction of some novelty or other.</p><p>It is in the exercise of their drinking powers that the Parthians look for their share of fame, and it was in this thatAlcibiades among the Greeks earned his great repute. Amongourselves, too, Novellius Torquatus of Mediolanum, a manwho held all the honours of the state from the prefecture to thepro-consulate, could drink off three congii<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> at a single draught,a feat from which he obtained the surname of "Tricongius:" this he did before the eyes of the Emperor Tiberius,and to his extreme surprise and astonishment, a man who inhis old age was very morose,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> and indeed very cruel in general; though in his younger days he himself had been toomuch addicted to wine. Indeed it was owing to that recommendation that it was generally thought that L. Piso was<pb n="3273" />selected by him to have the charge and custody<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> of the City ofRome; he having kept up a drinking-bout at the residence ofTiberius, just after he had become emperor, two days and twonights without intermission. In no point, too, was it generally said that Drusus Cæsar took after his father Tiberiusmore than this.<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> Torquatus had the rather uncommon glory—for this science, too, is regulated by peculiar laws of its own—of never being known to stammer in his speech, or to relievethe stomach by vomiting or urine, while engaged in drinking.lie was always on duty at the morning guard, was able toempty the largest vessel at a single draught, and yet to takemore ordinary cups in addition than any one else; he was always to be implicitly depended upon, too, for being able to drinkwithout taking breath and without ever spitting, or so muchas leaving enough at the bottom of the cup to make a plashupon the pavement;<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> thus showing himself an exact observerof the regulations which have been made to prevent all shirking on the part of drinkers.</p><p>Tergilla reproaches Cicero, the son of Marcus Cicero, withbeing in the habit of taking off a couple of congii at a singledraught, and with having thrown a cup, when in a state ofdrunkenness, at M. Agrippa;<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> such, in fact, being the ordinaryresults of intoxication. But it is not to be wondered at thatCicero was desirous in this respect to eclipse the fame of M.Antonius, the murderer of his father; a man who had, beforethe time of the younger Cicero, shown himself so extremelyanxious to maintain the superiority in this kind of qualifica-tion, that he had even gone so far as to publish a book uponthe subject of his own drunkenness.<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> Daring in this work tospeak in his own defence, he has proved very satisfactorily, tolay thinking, how many were the evils he had inflicted uponthe world through this same vice of drunkenness. It was buta short time before the battle of Actium that he vomited forth<pb n="3274" />this book of his, from which we have no great difficulty incoming to the conclusion, that drunk as lie already was withthe blood of his fellow-citizens, the only result was that hethirsted for it all the more. For, in fact, such is the infalliblecharacteristic of drunkenness, the more a person is in thehabit of drinking, the more eager he is for drink; and theremark of the Scythian ambassador is as true as it is wellknown—the more the Parthians drank, the thirstier they werefor it.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He does not state the reason, nor does it appear to be known.
