(9S.)ÑWONDERS OF THE SEA.</head><p>All seas are purified at the full moon<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>; some also at statedperiods. At Messina and Myl¾ refuse matter, like dung<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>,is cast up on the shore, whence originated the story of theoxen of the Sun having had their stable at that place. Towhat has been said above (not to omit anything with whichI am acquainted) Aristotle adds, that no animal dies exceptwhen the tide is ebbing. The observation has been oftenmade on the ocean of Gaul; but it has only been found truewith respect to man<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It has been suggested, with some plausibility, that the greater heightof the tides at this period will cause a greater quantity of matter to becast on shore. This circumstance is referred to by Seneca, Nat. Qu¾st.iii. 26; and by Strabo.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Alexandre observes on this supposed fact, "Algarum molles qu¾damspecies intelligend¾ sunt, qu¾ convolut¾ et marcid¾ in littusejiciuntur." Lemaire, i. 432.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It may cause some surprise to find that such an opinion has beenentertained even in modern times; but more correct observation hasshown it to be without foundation. Lemaire.</p></body>
