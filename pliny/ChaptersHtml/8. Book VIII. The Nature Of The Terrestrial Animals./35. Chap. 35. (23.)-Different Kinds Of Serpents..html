<div2 type="chapter" n="35" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 35. (23.)—DIFFERENT KINDS OF SERPENTS.</head><p>With reference to serpents, it is generally known, that they<pb n="2285" />assume the colour of the soil in which they conceal themselves.The different species of them are innumerable. The cerastes<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>has little horns, often four in number, projecting from thebody, by the movement of which it attracts birds, while therest of its body lies concealed.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> The amphisbæna<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> has twoheads,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> that is to say, it has a second one at the tail, asthough one mouth were too little for the discharge of all itsvenom. Some serpents have scales, some a mottled skin, andthey are all possessed of a deadly poison. The jaculus<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> dartsfrom the branches of trees; and it is not only to our feet thatthe serpent is formidable, for these fly through the air even,just as though they were hurled from an engine.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> The neckof the asp<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> puffs out,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> and there is no remedy whatever<pb n="2286" />against its sting, except the instant excision of the affectedpart.<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> This reptile, which is thus deadly, is possessed of thisone sense, or rather affection; the male and the female aregenerally found together,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> and the one cannot live withoutthe other; hence it is that, if one of them happens to be killed,the other takes incredible pains to avenge its death. It followsthe slayer of its mate, and will single him out among eversuch a large number of people, by a sort of instinctive knowledge; with this object it overcomes all difficulties, travels anydistance, and is only to be avoided by the intervention of riversor an accelerated flight. It is really difficult to decide, whetherNature has altogether been more liberal of good or of evil.First of all, however, she has given to this pest but weakpowers of sight, and has placed the eyes, not in the front of thehead, so that it may see straight before it, but in the temples,so that it is more frequently put in motion by the approach ofthe footstep than through the sight. (24.) The ichneumon, too,is its enemy<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> to the very death.<pb n="2287" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The cerastes, or horned serpent, is mentioned by Lucan, in his description of serpents, Pharsalia, B. ix. 1. 716. One of the Scholiasts onLucan relates a story that when Helen was eloping with Paris, she trod onthe back of a cerastes, and broke it; from which circumstance, the wholerace moved with a crooked course.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier has observed this animal burying itself in the sand, and hasseen the motion of its horns, but does not credit its alleged power of attracting birds; Lemaire, vol. iii. p. 412.—B.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The ampbisbæna is mentioned by Lucan, B. ix. 1. 719. "The dangerous amphisbæna, that moves on at either of its heads."</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The account of the two heads is obviously incorrect; the idea hasarisen from the two extremities being nearly of the same size and appearance. It has been supposed, that there were certain serpents, with thepower of moving with equal facility in both directions; and that the name,<foreign lang="greek">Amfi/sbaina,</foreign> was derived from this circumstance.—B.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Lucan mentions the jaculus, B. ix. 1. 720, and 1. 822. In the lastpassage he says: "Behold! afar, around the trunk of a barren tree, a fierceserpent-Africa calls it the jaculus-wreathes itself, and then darts forth,and through the head and pierced temples of Paulus it takes its flight:nothing does venom there affect, death seizes him through the wound. Itwas then understood how slowly fly the stones which the sling hurls, howsluggishly whizzes the flight of the Scythian arrow."</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There is an account of the jaculus, or, as it is called in Greek,<foreign lang="greek">)Akonti/as,</foreign> in Ælian, Anim. Nat. B. vi. c. 18; it is mentioned by Galen,Theriaca, c. 8.—B.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. ix. 1. 701, Lucan says: "Here the gore (of the Gorgon Medusa) which first from the sand lifted a head, raised the drowsy asp withits puffed-out neck." The whole of this passage in Lucan is well worth theattention of those desirous to know something of the serpent-lore of theancients.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier says, that Geoffroi St. Hilaire has identified this animal withthe Coluber haje of Linnæus, which has, from the earliest ages, been knownas a native of Egypt, and where it still exists. Its two most remarkablecharacteristics are those here referred to; the puffing out of the neck whenenraged, and its capacity of being tamed, or, as it is styled, enchanted.This last has been taken advantage of by the jugglers of that country fromthe most remote antiquity, as appears from the writings of Moses, and something of a similar nature is still practised. They remove the poison fangs,so as to render the animal harmless, and by certain sounds render it obedient to their call. It appears, also, that by pressing on the upper partof the spine, the animal is rendered paralytic, and may be said to be changedinto a rod; this fact was witnessed by St. Hilaire. The asp is describedby Aristotle, and is frequently mentioned by Ælian. Galen speaks of itsdeadly poison, in his Theriaca, c. 8. See Ajasson, vol. vi. pp. 437—9;Lemaire, vol. iii. pp. 414, 415.—B. Pliny mentions, however, in B. xxiii.c. 27, that the bite of the asp may be cured with vinegar.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Both Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 29, and Ælian, <hi rend="ital">ubi supra,</hi>speak of the extreme virulence of the poison of the asp, and Cuvier remarksthat the haje, and the haga, which are species of the asp, are among themost formidable of the serpent tribe.—B.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The method of attracting this serpent, by imitating the voice of thefemale, proves that there is some foundation for this statement.—B.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The ichneumon of the ancients, the "Viverra ichneumon" of Linnæus,is still common in Egypt, and renders essential service by destroying theeggs of serpents. With respect to what is here said of its covering itsbody with mud, to protect itself against the asp, the fact appears to be,that in searching for the eggs, which are deposited in the mud, its bodybecomes more or less covered with that substance, and may possibly inthis way be less exposed to the attacks of the asp. The contest of theasp and the ichneumon is mentioned by Ælian, B. iii. c. 22.—B.</p></body>
