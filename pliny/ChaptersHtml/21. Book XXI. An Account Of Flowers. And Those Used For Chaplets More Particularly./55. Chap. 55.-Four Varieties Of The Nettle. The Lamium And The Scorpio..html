THE LAMIUMAND THE SCORPIO.</head><p>But of all these plants, it is the nettle that is the bestknown to us, the calyces<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> of the blossoms of which produce apurple down: it frequently exceeds two cubits even inheight.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> There are numerous varieties of this plant; thewild nettle, known also as the female nettle, does not inflictso bad a sting as the others. Among the several varieties ofthe wild nettle, the one known as the dog<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>-nettle, stings the<pb n="4352" />worst, the stem of it even possessing that property; the leavesof the nettle are indented at the edge. There is one kindalso, which emits a smell, known as the Herculanean<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> nettle.The seed of all the nettles is copious, and black. It is a singular fact that, though possessed of no spinous points, thedown<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> of the nettle is of a noxious nature, and that, thoughever so lightly touched, it will immediately produce an itching sensation, and raise a blister on the flesh similar in appearance to a burn: the well-known remedy for it is olive oil.</p><p>The stinging property of the nettle does not belong to theplant at the earliest period of its growth, but only developesitself under the influence of the sun. The plant first beginsto grow in the spring, at which period it is by no means adisagreeable food;<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> indeed, it has become quite a religious observance to employ it as such, under the impression that it isa preventive from diseases the whole year through. The root,too, of the wild nettle, has the effect of rendering all meatmore tender that is boiled with it.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> The kind that is innoxiousand destitute of all stinging properties, is known as the "la-mium."<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> Of the scorpio<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> we shall have occasion to speakwhen treating of the medicinal plants.<pb n="4353" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Acetabulis." Fée complains of the use of this term (meaning a"small cup") in relation to the calyces of the nettle; such not being inreality their form.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably in allusion to the Urtica dioica, which grows to a greaterheight than the Urtica urens. See B. xxii. c. 15.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Canina." A variety, probably, of the Urtica urens, the nettle, withthe exception of the Urtica pilifera, which has the most stinging properties of all those found in Europe, and the leaves of which are the mostdeeply indented.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This has not been identified. They are all of them either inodorous,or else possessed of a faint, disagreeable smell.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This "lanugo," or down, as he calls it, consists of a fine elongatedtube of cellular tissue, seated upon a gland of similar tissue. In thisgland a poisonous fluid is secreted, and when any pressure is made uponthe gland, the fluid passes upwards in the tube. The nettle of the East,known as the Devil's Leaf, is of so poisonous a quality as to producedeath.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In some parts of the north of England and of Scotland the youngplant of the Urtica dioica is eaten as greens, and is far from a disagreeabledish, strongly resembling spinach. It is also reckoned a very wholesomediet, and is taken habitually in the spring, under the impression that itpurifies the blood. This notion, we see from the context, is as old as thetime of the Romans.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Dalechamps speaks of it as the custom in his time to wrap up fishand game in nettles, under the impression that they would keep the longerfor it.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The dead nettle, or blind nettle.
