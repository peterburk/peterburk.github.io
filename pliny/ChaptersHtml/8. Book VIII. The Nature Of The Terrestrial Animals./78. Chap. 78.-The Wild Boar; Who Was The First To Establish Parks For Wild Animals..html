<div2 type="chapter" n="78" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 78.—THE WILD BOAR; WHO WAS THE FIRST TO ESTABLISHPARKS FOR WILD ANIMALS.</head><p>The flesh of the wild boar is also much esteemed. Cato,<pb n="2345" />the Censor, in his orations, strongly declaimed against the useof the brawn of the wild boar.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> The animal used to be dividedinto three portions, the middle part of which was laid by,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>and is called boar's chine. P. Servilius Rullus was the firstRoman who served up a whole boar at a banquet; the fatherof that Rullus, who, in the consulship of Cicero, proposed theAgrarian law. So recent is the introduction of a thing whichis now in daily use. The Annalists have taken notice of sucha fact as this, clearly as a hint to us to mend our manners;seeing that now-a-days two or three boars are consumed, notat one entertainment, but as forming the first course only.</p><p>(52.) Fulvius Lupinus was the first Roman who formedparks<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> for the reception of these and other wild animals: hefirst fed them in the territory of Tarquinii: it was not long,however, that imitators were found in L. Lucullus and Q.Hortensius.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> The wild sow brings forth once only in theyear. The males are very fierce during the rutting time;they fight with each other, having first hardened their sidesby rubbing them against the trees, and covered themselveswith mud. The females, as is the case with animals of everykind, become more fierce just after they have brought forth.The wild boar is not capable of generating before the firstyear. The wild boar of India<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> has two curved teeth, projecting from beneath the muzzle, a cubit in length; and the samenumber projecting from the forehead, like the horns of theyoung bull. The hair of these animals, in a wild state, is the<pb n="2346" />eclour of copper, the others are black. No species whateverof the swine is found in Arabia.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Aprugnum callum;" Plauts, in detailing the preparations for afeast, enumerates the following articles, "pernam, callum, glandium,sumen;" Pseudolus, A. i. s. 2, 1. 32; all of which are parts of the hog.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Ponebatur." Littré and Ajasson render this, "placed at table."It would appear, however, that the meaning is that this part was put byfor salting, and the other parts were served at table while fresh.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Vivaria;" Varro, B. iii. c. 12, and Aulus Gellius, B. ii. c. 20, givean account of the different places which were employed by the Romansfor preserving animals of various descriptions, with their appropriatedesignations. Varro names the inventor Fulvius Lippinus.—B.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Varro, B. iii. c. 13, gives an animated description of a visit to whathe calls the leporarium of Hortensius, where, besides hares, as the nameimplies, there was a multitude of stags, boars, and other four-footedanimals.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ælian, De Anim. Nat. B. xvi. c. 37, says, that no boar, either wild ortame, is produced in India, and that the Indians never use the flesh ofthis animal, as they would regard the use of it with as much horror as ofhuman flesh.—B. The "Sus babiroussa" is probably meant by Pliny.</p></body>
