The third point of universal agreement was the division of time, a subject which afterwards appealed to the reasoning faculties. We have already stated, in the Second Book,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>when and by whom this art was first invented in Greece;the same was also introduced at Rome, but at a later period.In the Twelve Tables, the rising and setting of the sun arethe only things that are mentioned relative to time. Someyears afterwards, the hour of midday was added, the summoner<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> of the consuls proclaiming it aloud, as soon as, from thesenate-house, he caught sight of the sun between the Rostra andthe Græcostasis;<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> he also proclaimed the last hour, when the<pb n="2238" />sun had gone down from the Mænian column<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> to the prison.This, however, could only be done in clear weather, but itwas continued until the first Punic war. The first sun-dialis said to have been erected among the Romans twelve yearsbefore the war with Pyrrhus, by L. Papirius Cursor,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> atthe temple of Quirinus,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> on which occasion he dedicated itin pursuance of a vow which had been made by his father.This is the account given by Fabius Vestalis; but he makesno mention of either the construction of the dial or theartist, nor does he inform us from what place it was brought,or in whose works he found this statement made.</p><p>M. Varro<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> says that the first sun-dial, erected for the useof the public, was fixed upon a column near the Rostra, inthe time of the first Punic war, by the consul M. ValeriusMessala, and that it was brought from the capture of Catina,in Sicily: this being thirty years after the date assigned tothe dial of Papirius, and the year of Rome 491. The lines inthis dial did not exactly agree with the hours;<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> it served,however, as the regulator of the Roman time ninety-nineyears, until Q. Marcius Philippus, who was censor with L.Paulus, placed one near it, which was more carefully arranged: an act which was most gratefully acknowledged, asone of the very best of his censorship. The hours, however,still remained a matter of uncertainty, whenever the weather<pb n="2239" />happened to be cloudy, until the ensuing lustrum; at whichtime Scipio Nasica, the colleague of Lænas, by means of aclepsydra, was the first to divide the hours of the day andthe night into equal parts: and this time-piece he placed undercover and dedicated, in the year of Rome 595;<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> for so long aperiod had the Romans remained without any exact divisionof the day. We will now return to the history of the otheranimals, and first to that of the terrestrial.</p><p>SUMMARY.—Remarkable events, narratives, and observations, seven hundred and forty-seven.</p><p>ROMAN AUTHORS QUOTED.—Verrius Flaccus,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> Cneius Gellius,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>Licinius Mutianus,<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> Massurius Sabinius,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> Agrippina, the wifeof Claudius,<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> M.
