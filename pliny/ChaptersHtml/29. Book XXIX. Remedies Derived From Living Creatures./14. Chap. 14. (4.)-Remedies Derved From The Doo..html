It is for a corresponding reason, also, that punishment is yearly inflicted upon the dogs, by crucifying them aliveupon a gibbet of elder, between the Temple of Juventas<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> andthat of Summanus.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span></p><p>In reference to this last-mentioned animal, the usages of ourforefathers compel us to enter into some further details. Theyconsidered the flesh of sucking whelps to be so pure a meat,that they were in the habit of using them as victims even intheir expiatory sacrifices. A young whelp, too, is sacrificed toGenita Mana;<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and, at the repasts celebrated in honour of thegods, it is still the usage to set whelps' flesh on table; at theinaugural feasts, too, of the pontiffs, this dish was in common use, as we learn from the Comedies<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> of Plautus. It isgenerally thought that for narcotic<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> poisons there is nothingbetter than dogs' blood; and it would appear that it was thisanimal that first taught man the use of emetics. Other me-<pb n="5392" />dicinal uses of the dog which are marvellously commended, Ishall have occasion to refer to on the appropriate occasions.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. x. c. 26.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or Youth, in the Eighth Region of the City.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. ii. c. 53.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">An ancient divinity, who is supposed to have presided over childbirth.See Plutarch, Quæst.
