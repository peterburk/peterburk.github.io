(93.)ÑOF VENTS<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> IN THE EARTH.</head><p>But let us say no more of earthquakes and of whatevermay be regarded as the sepulchres of cities<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>; let us ratherspeak of the wonders of the earth than of the crimes ofnature. But, by Hercules! the history of the heavens themselves wouldnot be more difficult to relate:Ñthe abundanceof metals, so various, so rich, so prolific, rising up<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> during somany ages; when, throughout all the world, so much is,every day, destroyed by fire, by waste, by shipwreck, bywars, and by frauds; and while so much is consumed byluxury and by such a number of people:Ñthe figures ongems, so multiplied in their forms; the variously-colouredspots on certain stones, and the whiteness of others, excludingeverything except light:-the virtues of medicinal springs,and the perpetual fires bursting out in so many places, forso many ages:-the exhalation of deadly vapours, eitheremitted from caverns<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, or from certain unhealthy districts;some of them fatal to birds alone, as at Soracte, a districtnear the city<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>; others to all animals, except to man<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>, while<pb n="1122" />others are so to man also, as in the country of Sinuessa andPuteoli. They are generally called vents, and, by somepersons, Charon's sewers, from their exhaling a deadlyvapour. Also at Amsanctum, in the country of the Hirpini,at the temple of Mephitis<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>, there is a place which kills allthose who enter it. And the same takes place at Hierapolis inAsia<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>, where no one can enter with safety, except the priestof the great Mother of the Gods. In other places there areprophetic caves, where those who are intoxicated with thevapour which rises from them predict future events<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>, as atthe most noble of all oracles, Delphi. In which cases, whatmortal is there who can assign any other cause, than thedivine power of nature, which is everywhere diffused, andthus bursts forth in various places?</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Spiracula."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Busta urbium."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Suboriens," as M.

Qu¾st. vi. 28,as occurring "pluribus Itali¾ locis;" it may be ascribed to theexhalations fromvolcanos being raised up into the atmosphere. It does not appear thatthere is, at present, any cavern in Mount Soracte which emits mephiticvapours. But the circumstance of Soracte being regarded sacred toApollo, as we learn from our author, vii. 2, and from Virgil, ®n. xi. 785,may lead us to conjecture that something of the kind may formerly haveexisted there.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The author may probably refer to the well-known Grotto del Cane,where, in consequence of a stratum of carbonic acid gas, which occupiesthe lower part of the cave only, dogs and other animals, whose mouthsare near the ground, are instantly suffocated.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Celebrated in the well-known lines of Virgil, ®n. vii. 563 <hi rend="ital">etseq.,</hi> asthe "s¾vi spiracula Ditis."</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Apuleius gives us an account of this place from his own observation;De Mundo, ¤ 729.
