<div2 type="chapter" n="20" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 20.—REMEDES FOR THE ILIAC PASSION, AND FOR OTHERMALADIES OF THE BOWELS.</head><p>One of the most dangerous of maladies is that known by thename of "ileos:"<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> it may be combatted, they say, by tearinga bat asunder, and taking the blood, or by rubbing the abdo.men with it. Diarrhœa is arrested more particularly by takingsnails, prepared in manner already<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> mentioned for cases ofasthma; the ashes, also, of snails burnt alive, administered inastringent wine; the liver of poultry grilled; the dried crawof poultry, a part that is usually thrown away, mixed withpoppy-juice—in some cases it is used fresh, grilled, and takenin wine—partridge broth; the craw of partridges beaten up byitself in red wine; a wild ringdove boiled in oxycrate; a sheep'smilt, grilled and beaten up in wine; or else pigeons' dung,applied with honey. The crop of an ossifrage, dried and takenin drink, is remarkably useful for patients whose digestion isimpaired-indeed, its good effects may be felt if they only holdit in the hand while eating. Hence it is that some personswear it attached to the body as an amulet; a practice whichmust not be too long continued, it being apt to cause a wastingof the flesh. The blood, too, of a drake has an astringenteffect.</p><p>Flatulency is dispelled by eating snails; and griping painsin the bowels, by taking a sheep's milt grilled, with wine; awild ringdove boiled in oxycrate; the fat of an otis<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> in wine; orthe ashes of an ibis, burnt without the feathers, administered indrink. Another prescription mentioned for griping pains inthe bowels is of a very marvellous nature: if a duck, they say,is applied to the abdomen, the malady will pass into the bird,<pb n="5443" />and it will die.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> Gripings of the bowels are treated also withboiled honey in which the bees have died.</p><p>Colic is most effectually cured by taking a roasted lark withthe food. Some recommend, however, that it should be burntto ashes in a new vessel, feathers and all, and then poundedand taken for four consecutive days, in doses of three spoonfuls,in water. Some say that the heart of this bird should beattached to the thigh, and, according to others, the heart shouldbe swallowed fresh, quite warm, in fact. There is a familyof consular dignity, known as the Asprenates,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> two brothers,members of which, were cured of colic; the one by eating alark and wearing its heart in a golden bracelet; the other, byperforming a certain sacrifice in a chapel built of raw bricks,in form of a furnace, and then blocking up the edifice the moment the sacrifice was concluded. The ossifrage has a singleintestine only, which has the marvellous property of digestingall that the bird has swallowed: the extremity of this intestine, it is well known, worn as an amulet, is an excellentremedy for colic.</p><p>There are certain concealed maladies incident to the intestines, in relation to which there are some marvellous statementsmade. If to the stomach and chest, more particularly, blindpuppies are applied, and suckled with milk from the patient'smouth,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> the virulence of the malady, it is said, will be transferred to them, and in the end they will die: on openingthem, too, the causes of the malady will be sure to be discovered. In all such cases, however, the puppies must beallowed to die, and must be buried in the earth. Accordingto what the magicians say, if the abdomen is touched with abat's blood, the person will be proof against colic for a wholeyear: when a patient, too, is attacked with the pains of colic,if he can bring himself to drink the water in which he haswashed his feet, he will experience a cure.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The iliac passion, or ileus volvulus.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In c. 16 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A kind of bustard.
