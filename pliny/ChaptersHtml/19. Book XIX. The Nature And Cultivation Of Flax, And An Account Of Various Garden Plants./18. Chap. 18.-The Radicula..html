<div2 type="chapter" n="18" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 18.ÑTHE RADICULA.</head><p>The plant known to us by the name of "radicula,"<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> is the<pb n="4149" />second of these productions. It furnishes a juice that is extensively employed in washing wool, and it is quite wonderfulhow greatly it contributes to the whiteness and softness ofwool. It may be produced anywhere by cultivation, but thatwhich grows spontaneously in Asia, and Syria,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> upon rugged,rocky sites, is more highly esteemed. That, however, whichis found beyond the Euphrates has the highest repute of all.The stalk of it is ferulaceous<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and thin, and is sought by theinhabitants of those countries as an article of food. It is employed also for making unguents, being boiled up with theother ingredients, whatever they may happen to be. In leafit strongly resembles the olive. The Greeks have given it thename of "struthion." It blossoms in summer, and is agreeable to the sight, but entirely destitute of smell. It is somewhatthorny, and has a stalk covered with down. It has an extremely diminutive seed, and a large root, which is cut up andemployed for the purposes already mentioned.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "little root;" though, in reality, as Pliny says, it had a largeroot. Some writers have supposed, that by this name is meant theReseda luteola of Linn¾us, the "dyer's weed" of the moderns; but neitherPliny nor any of the Greek writers mention the Radicula as being usedfor dyeing. Some, again, identify it with the Gypsophila struthium ofLinn¾us, without sufficient warranty, however, as FŽe thinks.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Gypsophila struthium grows in Spain, and possibly, FŽe says,in other countries. Linn¾us has "pretended," he says, that the Spaniardsstill employ the root and stalk of the Gypsophila for the same purposes asthe ancients did the same parts of the Radicula. He himself, however,though long resident in Spain, had never observed such to be the fact.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This description, FŽe says, does not correspond with that of the Gypsophila struthium, the stalk of which does not at all resemble that of theferulaceous plants, and the leaf is quite different in appearance from thatof the olive.</p></body>
