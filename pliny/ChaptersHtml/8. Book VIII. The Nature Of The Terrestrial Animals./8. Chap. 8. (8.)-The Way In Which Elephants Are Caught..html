<div2 type="chapter" n="8" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 8. (8.)—THE WAY IN WHICH ELEPHANTS ARE CAUGHT.</head><p>In India<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> they are caught by the keeper guiding one of thetame elephants towards a wild one which he has found alone orhas separated from the herd; upon which he beats it, and whenit is fatigued mounts and manages it just the same way as theother. In Africa<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> they take them in pit-falls; but as soon asan elephant gets into one, the others immediately collect boughsof trees and pile up heaps of earth, so as to form a mound, andthen endeavour with all their might to drag it out. It was formerly the practice to tame them by driving the herds with horsemen into a narrow defile, artificially made in such a way asto deceive them by its length; and when thus enclosed by meansof steep banks and trenches, they were rendered tame by the<pb n="2256" />effects of hunger; as a proof of which, they would quietlytake a branch that was extended to them by one of the men.At the present day, when we take them for the sake of theirtusks, we throw darts at their feet, which are in general themost tender part of their body. The Troglodytæ, who inhabitthe confines of Æthiopia, and who live entirely on the flesh ofelephants procured by the chase, climb the trees which lienear the paths through which these animals usually pass.Here they keep a watch, and look out for the one which comeslast in the train; leaping down upon its haunches, they seizeits tail with the left hand, and fix their feet firmly upon theleft thigh. Hanging down in this manner, the man, withhis right hand, hamstrings the animal on one side, with avery sharp hatchet. The elephant's pace being retarded bythe wound, he cuts the tendons of the other ham, and thenmakes his escape; all of which is done with the very greatestcelerity. Others, again, employ a much safer, though lesscertain method; they fix in the ground, at considerable intervals, very large bows upon the stretch; these are kept steady byyoung men remarkable for their strength, while others, exerting themselves with equal efforts, bend them, and so woundthe animals as they pass by, and afterwards trace them bytheir blood. The female elephant is much more timid bynature than the male.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Albertus Magnus, in his work on Animals, B. viii. c. 3, gives a fulleraccount of this method of taking the wild elephant. He says: "A man,riding on a tame elephant, guides him to the woods, and when he has metwith some wild ones, drives the tame one against them, and makes itstrike them with its trunk: the tame one, being better fed, soon conquersthe wild elephant, and throws him to the ground; upon which, the manleaps upon him, and flogs him with a whip, and immediately the other becomes quiet." Strabo, B. xv., gives a different account of the mode ofcatching and taming the elephant in India.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This appears to have been taken from Plutarch; and we have thesame statement in Ælian, who particularly speaks of the sagacity of theanimal, in endeavouring to extricate itself from the trench.—B.</p></body>
