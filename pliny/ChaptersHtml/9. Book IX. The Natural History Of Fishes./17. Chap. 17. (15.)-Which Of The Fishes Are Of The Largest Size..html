<div2 type="chapter" n="17" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 17. (15.)—WHICH OF THE FISHES ARE OF THE LARGEST SIZE.</head><p>Tunnies are among the most remarkable for their size; wehave found one weighing as much as fifteen<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> talents, thebreadth of its tail being five cubits and a palm.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> In some ofthe rivers, also, there are fish of no less size, such, for instance,as the silurus<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> of the Nile, the isox<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> of the Rhenus, and the<pb n="2383" />attilus<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> of the Padus, which, naturally of an inactive nature,sometimes grows so fat as to weigh a thousand pounds, andwhen taken with a hook, attached to a chain, requires a yokeof oxen to draw it<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> on land. An extremely small fish, whichis known as the clupea,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> attaches itself, with a wonderfultenacity, to a certain vein in the throat of the attilus, and destroys it by its bite. The silurus carries devastation with itwherever it goes, attacks every living creature, and often dragsbeneath the water horses as they swim. It is also remark-<pb n="2384" />able, that in the Mœnus,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> a river of Germany, a fish that bears<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>a very strong resemblance to the sea-pig, requires to be drawnout of the water by a yoke of oxen; and, in the Danube, it istaken with large hooks of iron.<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> In the Borysthenes, also, thereis said to be a fish of enormous size, the flesh of which has nobones or spines in it, and is remarkable for its sweetness.</p><p>In the Ganges, a river of India, there is a fish found whichthey call the platanista;<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> it has the muzzle and the tail ofthe dolphin, and measures sixteen cubits in length. StatiusSebosus says, a thing that is marvellous in no small degree,that in the same river there are fishes<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> found, called worms;these have two gills,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> and are sixty cubits in length; they are<pb n="2385" />of an azure colour, and have received their name from theirpeculiar conformation. These fish, he says, are of such enormous strength, that with their teeth they seize hold of thetrunks of elephants that come to drink, and so drag them intothe water.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">About 1200 pounds. Cetti, in his "Natural History of Sardinia," vol.iii. p. 134, says that tunnies weighing a thousand pounds are far from uncommon, and that they have been taken weighing as much as 1800 pounds.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The same as the Latin "dodrans," or about nine inches. This passage is taken almost verbatim from Aristotle, Hist. Anim. c. 34. Cuviersays that this passage, although like the preceding one, taken from Aristotle, is much more incredible, (though Lacépede, by the way, disputesPliny's statement as to the weight of the tunny). "A distance," Cuviersays, "of from seven to eight feet from one point of the fork of the tailto the other, would denote a fish twenty-five feet in length; and it must beobserved, that most of the MSS. of Pliny say <hi rend="ital">two</hi> cubits." Aristotle, however, beyond a doubt saysfice.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now universally recognized as the sly silurus, or sheat-fish, called inthe United States the horn-pout, the Silurus glanis of Linnæus. On thisformerly much-discussed question, Cuvier has an interesting Note. "Therecan now be no longer any doubt as to the silurus; it is evidently synonymons with the 'glanis' of Aristotle; as we find Pliny, in c. 17 and 51,giving the same characteristics of the silurus, as Aristotle does of theglanis, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 20, and B. ix. c. 37; such, for instance, asthe care it takes of its young, and the effects produced upon it by the dogfish and the approach of storms. It is easy to prove also that it is notthe sturgeon, [as Hardouin thought it to be], but the fish that is still called'silurus' by the naturalists, the ' wels' or 'schaid' of the Germans, the'saluth' of the Swiss, &amp;c."</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier remarks, that it is by no means clear what fish is meant by this name, which is only found here and once in Hesychius, who calls it<foreign lang="greek">khtw/dhs,</foreign> "of the large kind." Rondelet, in his account of river fish,suggests that "exos" is the proper reading, and that under this name ismeant a species of sturgeon. Gesner asks if it might not possibly havebeen the "brochet;" but, as Cuvier says, that fish was well-known tothe Romans under the name of "lucius" [our pike], and it is not sufficiently large for Pliny to compare it to the wels or the attilus, and forHesychius to have enumerated it among the "large" fishes. It is inaccordance, however, with this suggestion of Gesner that the pike genusbears the name of "esox" in modern Natural History.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier says that there are found in the river Padus, or Po, severalspecies of very large sturgeons, and that there is one of these which stillbears the name, according to Salvian and Rondelet, of adello and adilo.Aldrovandus, he says, calls it adelo or ladano. This Cuvier takes to be theattilus of Pliny. But, according to Rezzonico, Paulus Jovius denies thatthe attilus or <hi rend="ital">adelus</hi> of the people of Ferrara is of the sturgeon genus;but says that it is so much larger than the sturgeon, and so different inshape, flavour, value, and natural habits, that the names of these twofishes were used proverbially by the people, when they were desirous tosignify two objects of totally different nature. Rezzonico remarks, thatthe name given to it in Ferrara was properly "l'adano," which becamecorrupted into "ladano," and expresses it as his opinion that it was thesame with the esox of the Rhine. He also states, that, from the exceedingwhiteness of the flesh, the ladano was called by the fishermen, <hi rend="ital">sturione</hi><hi rend="ital">bianco.</hi></p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Rezzonico says that this may possibly have happened in Pliny's day,but that in modern times no attilus or ladano is found weighing morethan 500 pounds. He says that this fish may, in comparison with thesturgeon, be aptly called an inert fish; for while the sturgeon makes thegreatest possible resistance to the fishermen, the other is taken with thegreatest ease.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier says, that this was probably the Petromyzon branchialis ofLinneus, the lampillon, a little fish resembling a worm, which adheres tothe gills of other fish, and sucks the blood. The same name was alsogiven to the Clupea alosa of Linnæus, our "shad;" indeed Linnæus gavethis name to the whole herring and pilchard genus, erroneously classingthem with the shad.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Main of the present day. But Dalechamps would read "Rheno;"for, he says, this river was not known to the ancients by the name of Mœnus.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">According to Albertus Magnus, this fish, which so strongly resembledthe sea-pig, or porpoise, was the huso, a kind of sturgeon.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. iv. c. 26. Cuvier says, that the fish here alluded to, is one ofthe large species of sturgeon, so common in the rivers that fall into theBlack Sea, the bones of which are cartilaginous, and the flesh is generallyexcellent eating.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier says, that this is probably the dolphin of the Ganges; a fishdescribed by Dr. Roxburgh, in his "Account of Calcutta," vol. vii. This fish,he says, has the muzzle and the tail of the common dolphin; but he declinesto assert that it attains the length of sixteen cubits.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Solinus gives an account of these worms of the Ganges, also frontSebosus, but not exactly to the same effect as Pliny. He says, that theyare of an azure colour, are <hi rend="ital">six</hi> cubits in length, and that they have <hi rend="ital">two</hi><hi rend="ital">arms.</hi> He gives the same account as to their extraordinary strength.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is evident that there is some mistake in the MSS. either of Solinusor Pliny, as they both copied from the same source. Pliny speaks of"branchiæ," or gills, while Solinus mentions "brachia," or arms; theformer, however, appears to be the preferable reading. Cuvier remarksthat Ctesias, in his Indica, c. 27, has given a similar account, but that theworm mentioned by him has two <hi rend="ital">teeth,</hi> and not <hi rend="ital">gills,</hi> and that it only seizesoxen and camels, and not elephants. He states also, that an oil was extracted from it, which set on fire everything that it touched. Cuvierobserves, that in most of the MSS. of Pliny the worm is sixty cubits long,instead of six, as in some few, a length which was quite necessary toenable it to devour an elephant; and he suggests that some large congeror muræna may have originally given rise to the story. It is by no meansimprobable that some individuals of the boa or python tribe, in the vicinity of the river, may have been taken for vast fish or river worms.Among the German traditions, we find the name "worm" given to hugeserpents, which are said to have spread devastation far and wide; and inthe north of England legends about, similar "worms," are by no meansuncommon: the story about the "Laidly Worm," in the county of Durham,for instance.</p></body>
