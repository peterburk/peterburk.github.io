<div2 type="chapter" n="32" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 32. (27.)—THIRTEEN DIFFERENT FLAVOURS OF JUICES.</head><p>While upon this subject, it may be as well to state thatthere are no less than thirteen different flavours<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> belonging<pb n="3324" />in common to the fruits and the various juices: the sweet, theluscious, the unctuous, the bitter, the rough, the acrid,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> thepungent, the sharp, the sour, and the salt; in addition towhich, there are three other kinds of flavours of a nature that istruly singular. The first of these last kinds is that flavour inwhich several other flavours are united, as in wine, for instance; for in it we are sensible of the rough, the pungent,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>and the luscious, all at the same moment, and all of themflavours that belong to other substances. The second of theseflavours is that in which we are sensible at the same instantof a flavour that belongs to another substance, and yet of onethat is peculiar to the individual object of which we are tasting, such as that of milk, for instance: indeed, in milk wecannot correctly say that there is any pronounced flavour thatis either sweet, or unctuous, or luscious, a sort of smooth taste<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>in the mouth being predominant, which holds the place of amore decided flavour. The third instance is that of water,which has no flavour whatever, nor, indeed, any flavouringprinciple;<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> but still, this very absence of flavour is consideredas constituting one of them, and forming a peculiar class<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> ofitself; so much so, indeed, that if in water any taste or flavouring principle is detected, it is looked upon as impure.</p><p>In the perception of all these various flavours the smellplays a very considerable<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> part, there being a very greataffinity between them. Water, however, is properly quite inodorous: and if the least smell is to be perceived, it is notpure water. It is a singular thing that three of the principalelements<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> of Nature—water, air, and fire—should have neithertaste nor smell, nor, indeed, any flavouring principle whatever.<pb n="3325" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Fée remarks, that in this enumeration there is no method. Linnæusenumerates eleven principal flavours in the vegetable kingdom—dry orinsipid, aqueous, viscous, salt, acrid, styptic, sweet, fat, bitter, acid, andnauseous; these terms, however seem, some of them, to be very indefinite.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It requires considerable discernment to appropriate nicely its Englishsynonym to these four varieties of tastes, "acer, acutus, acerbus, andacidus," more especially when we find that the "bitter" and the "rough"are occupied already by the "amarus" and the "austerus."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In allusion, probably, to the pungency of the aroma or bouquet.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Lenitate.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This seems to be the meaning of "succus."</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The "insipid."</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is so much the case, that the most nauseous medicine may betaken almost with impunity—so far as taste is concerned—by tightly pressing the nostrils while taking it.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Fée remarks that this is true of fire, and of distilled or perfectly purewater; but that physiologists are universally agreed that the air has itsown peculiar smell.</p></body>
