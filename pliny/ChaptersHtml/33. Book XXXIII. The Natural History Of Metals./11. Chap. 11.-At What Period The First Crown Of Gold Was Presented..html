<div2 type="chapter" n="11" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 11.ÑAT WHAT PERIOD THE FIRST CROWN OF GOLD WASPRESENTED.</head><p>But, a thing that is more surprising still, crowns<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> of goldwere given to the citizens as well. As to the person who wasfirst presented with one, so far as I have enquired, I have notbeen able to ascertain his name: L. Piso says, however, thatthe Dictator<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> A. Posthumius was the first who conferred one:on taking the camp of the Latins at Lake Regillus,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> he gavea crown of gold, made from the spoil, to the soldier whosevalour had mainly contributed to this success. L. Lentulus,<pb n="6087" />also, when consul,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> presented one to Servius Cornelius Merenda,on taking a town of the Samnites; but in his case it was fivepounds in weight. Piso Frugi, too, presented his son with agolden crown, at his own private expense, making<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> it a specificlegacy in his will.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">On this subject, see B. xvi. c. 3, and B. xxi. c. i.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A.U.C. 323, or <date value="-431" authname="-431">431</date> B.C.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Situate about fourteen miles from Rome, and on the road to thetown called La Colonna.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A.U.C. 479, and B.C. <date value="-275" authname="-275">275</date>.

Properly speaking, "pr¾legare" was"to bequeath a thing to be given before the inheritance was divided."The crown thus left by Piso was to be three pounds in weight.</p></body>
