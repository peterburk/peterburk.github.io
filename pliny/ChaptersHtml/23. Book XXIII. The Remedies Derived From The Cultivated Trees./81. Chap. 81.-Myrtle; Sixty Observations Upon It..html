They impart an agreeable smell<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> to thebreath, even when eaten the day before; thus, for instance, inMenander we find the Synaristosæ<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> eating them. They aretaken also for dysentery,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> in doses of one denarius, in wine:and they are employed lukewarm, in wine, for the cure ofobstinate ulcers on the extremities. Mixed with polenta, theyare employed topically in ophthalmia, and for the cardiacdisease<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> they are applied to the left breast. For stings inflicted by scorpions, diseases of the bladder, head-ache, andfistulas of the eye before suppuration, they are similarly employed; and for tumours and pituitous eruptions, the kernelsare first removed and the berries are then pounded in oldwine. The juice of the berries<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> acts astringently upon thebowels, and is diuretic: mixed with cerate it is applied topically to blisters, pituitous eruptions, and wounds inflicted bythe phalangium; it imparts a black tint,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> also, to the hair.<pb n="4520" /></p><p>The oil of this myrtle is of a more soothing nature than thejuice, and the wine<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> which is extracted from it, and whichpossesses the property of never inebriating, is even more so.This wine, used when old, acts astringently upon the stomachand bowels, cures griping pains in those regions, and dispelsnausea.</p><p>The dried leaves, powdered and sprinkled upon the body,check profuse perspirations, in fever even; they are good, too,used as a fomentation, for cœliac affections, procidence of theuterus, diseases of the fundament, running ulcers, erysipelas,loss of the hair, scaly and other eruptions, and burns. Thispowder is used as an ingredient, also, in the plasters known as"liparæ;"<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> and for the same reason the oil of the leaves isused for a similar purpose, being extremely efficacious as anapplication to the humid parts of the body, the mouth and theuterus, for example.</p><p>The leaves themselves, beaten up with wine, neutralize<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> thebad effects of fungi; and they are employed, in combinationwith wax, for diseases of the joints, and gatherings. A decoction of them, in wine, is taken for dysentery and dropsy.Dried and reduced to powder, they are sprinkled upon ulcersand hæmorrhages. They are useful, also, for the removal offreckles, and for the cure of hang-nails,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> whitlows, condylo-mata, affections of the testes, and sordid ulcers. In combinationwith cerate, they are used for burns.</p><p>For purulent discharges from the ears, the ashes of theleaves are employed, as well as the juice and the decoction:the ashes are also used in the composition of antidotes. For asimilar purpose the blossoms are stripped from off the youngbranches, which are burnt in a furnace, and then pounded inwine. The ashes of the leaves, too, are used for the cure ofburns. To prevent ulcerations from causing swellings in theinguinal glands, it will suffice for the patient to carry<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> a sprigof myrtle about him which has never touched the ground orany implement of iron.<pb n="4521" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A variety with white berries, but which variety it appears impossibleto say.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xv. c. 37.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The leaves and berries are bitter, and rich in volatile oil.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is consistent with fact.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A work of some kind, (perhaps a play, if the comic writer; Menander,is the person alluded to) the title of which means "the Women Diningtogether."
