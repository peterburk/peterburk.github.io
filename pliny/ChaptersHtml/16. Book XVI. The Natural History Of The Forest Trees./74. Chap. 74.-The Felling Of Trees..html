<div2 type="chapter" n="74" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 74.—THE FELLING OF TREES.</head><p>The proper time for felling trees that are wanted forbarking, the round, tapering trees, for instance, that are employed in temples and for other purposes, is at the period ofgermination:<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> for at other times it is quite impossible todetach the bark from the rotten wood that adheres to it, whilethe wood itself assumes a blackish hue. Squared logs, andwood from which the bark has been lopped, are generally cutin the period that intervenes between the winter solstice andthe prevalence of the west winds; or else, if it is necessaryto anticipate that period, at the setting of Arcturus andbefore that of the Lyre, the very earliest period being thesummer solstice: the days of these respective constellationswill be mentioned in the appropriate place.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span></p><p>In general it is looked upon as quite sufficient to use alldue precaution that a tree is not rough-hewn before it hasborne its yearly crop. The robur, if cut in spring, is subjectto the attacks of wood-worm, but if cut in winter, will neitherrot nor warp: otherwise it is very liable to bend and becomeawry, as well as to crack; the same is the case, too, with thecork-tree, even if cut down at the proper time. The state ofthe moon,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> too, is of infinite importance, and it is generallyrecommended that trees should be cut only between the twentieth and the thirtieth days of the month. It is generallyagreed, however, by all, that it is the very best time forfelling timber, when the moon is in conjunction with thesun, a day which is called by some persons the interlu-nium, and by others the moon's silence. At all events, it was<pb n="3416" />under these circumstances that Tiberius Cæsar gave ordersfor the larches to be cut in Rhætia, that were required forthe purpose of rebuilding the bridge of the Naumachia<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> afterit had been destroyed by fire. Some persons say that themoon ought not only to be in conjunction, but below the horizon as well, a thing that can only happen in the night. If theconj unction should chance to fall on the very day of the wintersolstice, the timber, they say, that is then felled will be of everlasting duration; the next best being the timber that is cutwhen the conjunction coincides with the constellations previously mentioned. There are some, too, who add the risingof the Dog-star as a favourable time, and say that it was atthis period that the timber was cut which was employed inbuilding the Forum of Augustus.</p><p>Wood which is intended for timber ought to be cut neitherwhen too young nor too old. Some persons, too—and the practice is by no means without its utility—cut round<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> the tree asfar as the pith, and then leave the timber standing, so that allthe juices may be enabled to escape. Going back to ancienttimes, it is a remarkable fact, that in the first Punic War thefleet commanded by Duillius was on the water within sixtydays from the time the timber was cut: and, what is stillmore so, Piso relates that King Hiero had two hundred andtwenty ships wholly constructed in forty-five days: in thesecond Punic War, too, the fleet of Scipio was at sea the fortiethday after the axe had been put to the tree. Such is theenergy and dispatch that can be displayed on occasions ofemergency.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This practice was formerly forbidden by the forest laws of France.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. xviii.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny borrows this superstition from Theophrastus, Hist.
