<div2 type="chapter" n="37" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 37. (37.)—OR THE STARS WHICH ARE NAMED CASTORAND POLLUX<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>.</head><p>These stars occur both at sea and at land. I have seen,during the night-watches of the soldiers, a luminous appearance, likea star, attached to the javelins on the ramparts.They also settle on the yard-arms and other parts of shipswhile sailing, producing a kind of vocal sound, like that of birdsflitting about. When they occur singly they are mischievous,so as even to sink the vessels, and if they strike on the lowerpart of the keel, setting them on fire<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>. When there are twoof them they are considered auspicious, and are thought topredict a prosperous voyage, as it is said that they driveaway that dreadful and terrific meteor named Helena. Onthis account their efficacy is ascribed to Castor and Pollux,and they are invoked as gods. They also occasionally shineround the heads of men in the evening<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>, which is considered<pb n="1065" />as predicting something very important. But there is greatuncertainty respecting the cause of all these things, and theyare concealed in the majesty of nature.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">These phænomena are admitted to be electrical; they are referred toby Seneca, Nat. Quæst. i. 1. This appearance is noticed as of frequentoccurrence in the Mediterranean, where it is named the fire of St. Elmo;see Hardouin in Lemaire, i. 311, and Fouché in Ajasson, ii. 382.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Perhaps this opinion may be maintained on the principle, that, whenthere is a single luminous appearance only, it depends upon the dischargeof a quantity of electrical fluid in a condensed state; its effects are, hithis case, those that would follow from a stroke of lightning.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is said by Livy to have occurred to Servius Tullius while he wasa child; lib. i. cap. 39; and by Virgil to Ascanius, Æn. ii. 632–5.</p></body>
