<div2 type="chapter" n="14" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 14. (14.)—THE KINDS OF HONEY PECULIAR TO VARIOUSPLACES.</head><p>The peculiar excellence of honey depends, as already stated,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>on the country in which it is produced; the modes, too, ofestimating its quality are numerous. In some countries we findthe honey-comb remarkable for the goodness of the wax, as inSicily, for instance, and the country of the Peligni; in otherplaces the honey itself is found in greater abundance, as inCrete, Cyprus, and Africa; and in others, again, the comb isremarkable for its size; the northern climates, for instance,for in Germany a comb has been known to be as much as eightfeet in length, and quite black on the concave surface.</p><p>But whatever the country in which it may happen to have beenproduced, there are three different kinds of honey.—Springhoney<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> is that made in a comb which has been constructed offlowers, from which circumstance it has received the name of <hi rend="ital">an-</hi><hi rend="ital">thinum.</hi> There are some persons who say that this should notbe touched, because the more abundant the nutriment, the<pb n="3013" />stronger will be the coming swarm; while others, again, leaveless of this honey than of any other for the bees, on the groundthat there is sure to be a vast abundance at the rising of thegreater constellations, as well as at the summer solstice, whenthe thyme and the vine begin to blossom, for then they aresure to find abundant materials for their cells.</p><p>In taking the combs the greatest care is always requisite, forwhen they are stinted for food the bees become desperate, andeither pine to death, or else wing their flight to other places:but on the other hand, over-abundance will entail idleness,and then they will feed upon the honey, and not the bee-bread.Hence it is that the most careful breeders take care to leavethe bees a fifteenth part of this gathering. There is a certainday for beginning the honey-gathering, fixed, as it were, by alaw of Nature, if men would only understand or observe it,being the thirtieth day after the bees have swarmed and comeforth. This gathering mostly takes place before the end ofMay.</p><p>The second kind of honey is "summer honey," which, fromthe circumstance of its being produced at the most favourableseason, has received the Greek name of <hi rend="ital">horaion</hi>;<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> it is generally made during the next thirty days after the solstice, whileSirius is shining in all its brilliancy. Nature has revealed inthis substance most remarkable properties to mortals, were itnot that the fraudulent propensities of man are apt to falsifyand corrupt everything. For, after the rising of each constellation, and those of the highest rank more particularly, or afterthe appearance of the rainbow, if a shower does not ensue,but the dew becomes warmed by the sun's rays, a medicament,and not real honey, is produced; a gift sent from heaven forthe cure of diseases of the eyes, ulcers, and maladies of theinternal viscera. If this is taken at the rising of Sirius, andthe rising of Venus, Jupiter, or Mercury should happen to fallon the same day, as often is the case, the sweetness of thissubstance, and the virtue which it possesses of restoring mento life, are not inferior to those attributed to the nectar of thegods.<pb n="3014" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In the last Chapter.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "Flower-honey."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Season-honey.</p></body>
