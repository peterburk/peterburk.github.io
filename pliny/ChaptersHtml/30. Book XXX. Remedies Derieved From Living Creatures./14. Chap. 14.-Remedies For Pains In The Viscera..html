<div2 type="chapter" n="14" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 14.ÑREMEDIES FOR PAINS IN THE VISCERA.</head><p>We give the one general name of "pr¾cordia" to thehuman viscera; for pains in any part of which, a suckingwhelp is applied, being pressed close to the part affected.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> Themalady, it is said, will in such case pass into the animal; afact which may be satisfactorily ascertained; for on disembowelling it, and sprinkling the entrails with wine, that part of theviscera will be found affected in which the patient himselfwas sensible of pain: to bury the animal in such a case is apoint most religiously observed. The dogs,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> too, which wecall "Melit¾i," applied to the stomach every now and then,allay pains in that region: the malady, it is supposed, passesinto the animal's body, as it gradually loses its health, andit mostly dies.</p><p>(6.) Affections of the lungs are cured by using mice, those ofAfrica more particularly, the animal being skinned and boiledin salt and oil, and then taken with the food. The same preparation is used also, for the cure of purulent or bloody expectorations.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hence, perhaps, the practice of nursing lap-dogs.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. iii. c. 30, and Note 2, p. 267.</p></body>
