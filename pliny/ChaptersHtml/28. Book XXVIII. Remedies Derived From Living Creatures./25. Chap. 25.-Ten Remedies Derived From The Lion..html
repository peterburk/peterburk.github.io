Thefrivolous lies of the magicians assert that persons who areanointed with lion's fat, will more readily win favour withkings and peoples; more particularly when the fat has beenused that lies between the eyebrows of the animal-a place, infact, where there is no fat to be found! The like effects theypromise also from the possession of a lion's tooth, one from theright side in particular, as also the shaggy hairs that arefound upon the lower jaw. The gall, used as an ointment incombination with water, improves the eyesight, and, employedwith the fat of the same animal, is a cure for epilepsy; buta slight taste only must be taken of it, and the patient mustrun immediately after swallowing it, in order to digest it. Alion's heart, used as food, is curative of quartan fevers, andthe fat, taken with oil of roses, of quotidian fevers. Wildbeasts will fly from persons anointed with lion's fat, and it isthought to be a preservative even against treacherous practices.</p></div2></body>
