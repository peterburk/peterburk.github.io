But so great a pestwas the crocodile to prove, that Nature was not content withgiving it one enemy only; the dolphins, therefore, which enter<pb n="2289" />the Nile, have the back armed with a spine,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> which is edgedlike a knife, as if for this very purpose; and although theseanimals are much inferior in strength, they contrive to destroy the crocodile by artifice, which on the other hand attempts to drive them from their prey, and would reign alonein its river as its peculiar domain. For all animals have anespecial instinct in this respect, and are able to know notonly what is for their own advantage, but also what is to thedisadvantage of their enemies; they fully understand the useof their own weapons, they know their opportunity, and theweak parts of those with which they have to contend.</p><p>The skin of the belly of the crocodile is soft and thin,aware of this, the dolphins plunge into the water, as if ingreat alarm, and diving beneath its belly, tear it open withtheir spines. There is a race of men also, who are peculiarlyhostile to this animal; they are known as the Tentyritæ, froman island in the Nile which they inhabit.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> These men are ofsmall stature, but of wonderful presence of mind, though forthis particular object only. The crocodile is a terrible animalto those who fly from it, while at the same time it will flyfrom those who pursue it; these, however, are the only peoplewho dare to attack it. They even swim in the river after it, andmount its back like so many horsemen; and just as the animalturns up its head for the purpose of biting them, they insert aclub into its mouth, holding which at each end, with the twohands, it acts like a bit, and, by these means they drive thecaptured animal on shore. They also terrify the crocodile somuch by their voice alone even, as to force it to disgorgethe bodies which it has lately swallowed, for the purpose ofburial. This island, therefore, is the only place near which thecrocodile never swims; indeed, it is repelled by the odour ofthis race of men, just as serpents are by that of the Psylli.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> The<pb n="2290" />sight of this animal is said to be dull when it is in the water,but, when out of the water, piercing in the extreme; it alwayspasses the four winter months in a cave, without taking food.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>Some persons say, that this is the only animal that continuesto increase in size as long as it lives; it is very long-lived.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There is a small lizard, called by the modern naturalists the Lacertascincus; but Cuvier conceives that this cannot be the animal here referredto, because it is so very much smaller than the ichneumon, that no onewould have thought of comparing them; and, what seems a better reason,because it is not found in the Nile. From the account of the scincus inB. xxviii. c. 30, it is probable that the animal here referred to is a speciesof monitor, popularly called the land crocodile. Herodotus, B. iv. c. 192,speaks of the land crocodile as found in Libya; it is also mentioned byPausanias, Corinthiaca, c. 20, and by Prosper Alpinus, Ægypt. B. iv. c. 5.—B. The scincus is probably the "Lacerta ouaran" of Cuvier.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier remarks, that this account cannot really apply to the dolphin,because none of the cetacea possess the spines here described. He investigates the subject with his usual sagacity, and concludes, with much probability, that the animal here referred to was a squalus, the Squalus centrina, or spinax of Linnæus; Ajasson, vol. vi. pp. 443, 444; Lemaire, vol.iii. pp. 422, 423. We have an account of the contest between the crocodileand the dolphin in Seneca, Nat. Quæst. B. iv. c. 2.—B.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We have some account of the Tentyritæ in Ælian, Anim. Nat. B. x.c. 21.—B. See B. xxviii. c. 6.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. vii. c. 2. The best description of the Psylli is that given byLucan in B. ix. 1. 892, <hi rend="ital">et seq.</hi>, where he describes the march of Cato's armyacross the burning coasts of the Syrtes.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This, as Cuvier remarks, is the case with the crocodiles of North America, which, like other reptiles, become torpid during the cold season;Ajasson, vol. vi. p. 444; Lemaire, vol. iii. p. 424.—B.</p></body>
