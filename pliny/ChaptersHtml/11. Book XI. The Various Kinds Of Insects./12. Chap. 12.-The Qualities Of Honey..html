<div2 type="chapter" n="12" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 12.—THE QUALITIES OF HONEY.</head><p>In the lower part of the hive they construct for their futuresovereign a palatial abode,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> spacious and grand, separated fromthe rest, and surmounted by a sort of dome: if this prominence should happen to be flattened, all hopes of progeny arelost. All the cells are hexagonal, each foot<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> having formedits own side. No part of this work, however, is done at anystated time, as the bees seize every opportunity for the performance of their task when the days are fine; in one or twodays, at most, they fill their cells with honey.</p><p>(12.) This substance is engendered from the air,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> mostly atthe rising of the constellations, and more especially whenSirius is shining; never, however, before the rising of theVergiliæ, and then just before day-break. Hence it is, that atearly dawn the leaves of the trees are found covered with akind of honey-like dew, and those who go into the open air atan early hour in the morning, find their clothes covered, andtheir hair matted, with a sort of unctuous liquid. Whetherit is that this liquid is the sweat of the heavens, or whethera saliva emanating from the stars, or a juice exuding from theair while purifying itself, would that it had been, when itcomes to us, pure, limpid, and genuine, as it was, when firstit took its downward descent. But as it is, falling from sovast a height, attracting corruption in its passage, and taintedby the exhalations of the earth as it meets them, sucked, too,as it is from off the trees and the herbage of the fields, andaccumulated in the stomachs of the bees—for they cast it up<pb n="3012" />again through the mouth—deteriorated besides by the juicesof flowers, and then steeped within the hives and subjected tosuch repeated changes—still, in spite of all this, it affords usby its flavour a most exquisite pleasure, the result, no doubt,of its æthereal nature and origin.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier says that the cell for the future queen is different from theothers, and much larger. The bees also supply the queen larva much moreabundantly with food, and of more delicate quality.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier says that this coincidence with the number of the legs is quiteaccidental, as it is with the mouth that the animal constructs the cell.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The basis of it is really derived from the calix or corolla of flowers.</p></body>
