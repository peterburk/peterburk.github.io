<div2 type="chapter" n="30" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 30.ÑTRANSPLANTING OPERATIONS AS DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT THE VARIOUS SEASONS OF THE YEAR.</head><p>If the enquiry is made what is the proper season for planting the olive, my answer will be, " where the soil is dry, atseed-time; where it is rich, in spring." The following is theadvice given by Cato<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> on the subject: "Begin pruning yourolive-yard fifteen days before the vernal equinox; from thatperiod for forty days will be a good time for doing so. Inpruning, adopt the following rules: when the ground is extremely productive, remove all the dry branches or such asmay have been broken by the wind; where it is not so prolific, you must cut away still more, then tie them well up,and remove all tangled branches, so as to lighten the roots.In autumn clear away the roots of the olive, and then manurethem. The man who labours most assiduously and mostearnestly will remove the very smallest fibres that are attachedto the roots. If, however, he hoes negligently, the roots willsoon appear again above ground, and become thicker thanever; the consequence of which will be, that the vigour of thetree will be expended in the roots."</p><p>We have already stated, when speaking on the subject of<pb n="3488" />oil,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> what are the different varieties of the olive, in what kindof soil it ought to be planted, and what is the proper aspectfor the olive-yard. Mago recommends that the olive shouldbe planted on declivities and in dry spots, in an argillaceoussoil, and between autumn and the winter equinox. If, on theother hand, the soil is thick, humid, or somewhat damp even,it ought to be planted between harvest and the winter solstice;advice, however, it should be remembered, applicable to Africamore particularly. At the present day, it is mostly the customin Italy to plant the olive in spring, but if it is thought desirable to do so in the autumn as well, there are only four daysin the forty between the equinox and the setting of the Vergili¾ that are unfavourable for planting it.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> It is a practicepeculiar to Africa, to engraft the olive on the wild olive only,a tree which is made to be everlasting, as it were; for when itbecomes old the best of the suckers are carefully trained foradoption by grafting, and in this way in another tree itgrows young again; an operation which may be repeated continuously as often as needed; so much so, indeed, that thesame olive-yard will last for ages.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> The wild olive also ispropagated both by insertion and inoculation.</p><p>It is not advisable to plant the olive in a site where thequercus has been lately rooted up; for the earth-worms, knownas "rau¾" which breed in the root of the quercus, are aptto get into that of the olive. It has been found, from practicalexperience, that it is not advisable to bury the cuttings in theground nor yet to dry them before they are planted out. Experience has also taught us that it is the best plan to clean anold olive-yard every other year, between the vernal equinoxand the rising of the Vergili¾, and to lay moss about the roots;to dig holes also round the trees every year, just after thesummer solstice, two cubits wide by a foot in depth, and tomanure them every third year.</p><p>Mago, too, recommends that the almond should be plantedbetween the setting of Arcturus<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> and the winter solstice. All<pb n="3489" />the varieties, however, of the pear, he says, should not beplanted at the same time, as they do not all blossom together.Those with oblong or round fruit should be planted betweenthe setting of the Vergili¾ and the winter solstice, and theother kinds in the middle of the winter, after the setting of theconstellation of the Arrow,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> on a site that looks towards theeast or north. The laurel should be planted between thesetting of the Eagle and that of the Arrow; for we find thatthe proper time for planting is equally connected with the aspectof the heavenly bodies. For the most part it has been recommended that this should be done in spring and autumn; butthere is another appropriate period also, though known to butfew, about the rising of the Dog-star, namely; it is not, however, equally advantageous in all localities. Still, I ought notto omit making mention of it, as I am not setting forth thepeculiar advantages of any one country in particular, but amenquiring into the operations of Nature taken as a whole.</p><p>In the region of Cyrenaica, the planting is generally donewhile the Etesian<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> winds prevail, and the same is the case inGreece, and with the olive more particularly in Laconia. Atthis period, also, the vine is planted in the island of Cos; andin the rest of Greece they do not neglect to inoculate and graft,though they do not<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> plant, their trees just then. The naturalqualities, too, of the respective localities, exercise a very considerable influence in this respect; for in Egypt they plant inany month, as also in all other countries where summer rainsdo not prevail, India and ®thiopia, for instance. When treesare not planted in the spring they must be planted in autumn,as a matter of course.</p><p>There are three stated periods, then, for germination;<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> spring,the rising of the Dog-star, and that of Arcturus. And, indeed,it is not the animated beings only that are ardent for the propagation of their species, for this desire is manifested in evena greater degree by the earth and all its vegetable productions;to employ this tendency at the proper moment is the most<pb n="3490" />advantageous method of ensuring an abundant increase. Thesemoments, too, are of peculiar importance in relation to theprocess of grafting, as it is then that the two productions manifest a mutual desire of uniting. Those who prefer the springfor grafting commence operations immediately after the vernalequinox, reckoning on the fact that then the buds are justcoming out, a thing that greatly facilitates the union of thebarks. On the other hand, those who prefer the autumn graftimmediately after the rising of Arcturus, because then the graftat once takes root in some degree, and becomes seasoned forspring, so as not to exhaust its strength all at once in the process of germination. However, there are certain fixed periodsof the year, in all cases, for certain trees; thus, the cherry,for instance, and the almond, are either planted or grafted aboutthe winter solstice. For many trees the nature of the localitywill be the best guide; thus, where the soil is cold and moistit is best to plant in spring, and where it is dry and hot, inautumn.</p><p>Taking Italy in general, the proper periods for these operations may be thus distributed:ÑThe mulberry is planted atany time between the ides of February<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> and the vernal equinox; the pear, in the autumn, but not beyond the fifteenthday before the winter solstice; the summer apples, the quince,the sorb, and the plum, between mid-winter and the ides ofFebruary: the Greek carob<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> and the peach, at any time inautumn before the winter solstice; the various nuts, such asthe walnut, pine, filbert, almond, and chesnut, between thecalends of March<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> and the ides of that month;<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> the willowand the broom about the calends of March. The broom isgrown from seed, and in a dry soil, the willow from plants, ina damp locality, as already stated on former occasions.<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span></p><p>(19.) That I may omit nothing to my knowledge of thefacts that I have anywhere been able to ascertain, I shall hereadd a new method of grafting, which has been discovered byColumella,<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> as he asserts, by the aid of which trees even of aheterogeneous or dissociable nature may be made to unite;<pb n="3491" />such, for instance, as the fig and the olive. In accordancewith this plan, he recommends that a fig-tree should be plantednear an olive, at a distance sufficiently near to admit of the figbeing touched by a branch of the olive when extended to itsfull length; as supple and pliant a one as possible being selectedfor' the purpose, and due care being taken all the time torender it seasoned by keeping it constantly on the stretch.After this, when the fig has gained sufficient vigour, a thingthat generally happens at the end of three or five years atmost, the top of it is cut off, the end of the olive branch beingalso cut to a point in the manner already stated.<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> Thispoint is then to be inserted in the trunk of the fig, and madesecure with cords, lest, being bent, it should happen to rebound:in this way we find the method of propagating by layers combined with that of grafting. This union between the two parent trees is allowed to continue for three years, and then inthe fourth the branch is cut away and left entirely upon thetree that has so adopted it. This method however, is notat present universally known, at all events, so far as I havebeen able to ascertain.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">De Re Rust. 44.
