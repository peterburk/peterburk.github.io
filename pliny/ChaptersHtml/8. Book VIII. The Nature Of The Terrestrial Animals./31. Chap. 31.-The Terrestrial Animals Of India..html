The Ors¾anIndians hunt down a kind of ape, which has the body white<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> allover; as well as a very fierce animal called the monoceros,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>which has the head of the stag, the feet of the elephant, andthe tail of the boar, while the rest of the body is like that of thehorse; it makes a deep lowing noise, and has a single blackhorn, which projects from the middle of its forehead, twocubits in length.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> This animal, it is said, cannot be takenalive.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably meaning, "not cloven."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier conjectures, that this is from Ctesias, and says, that a similaranimal is to be seen on one of the sculptures of Persepolis.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably the stag of the Ganges, the "Cervus axis" of Linn¾us; butif so, Pliny has omitted to mention the horns.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">White apes are now unknown, as a distinct species, but individualsare occasionally found nearly without colour.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The "one-horned," or the unicorn.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We have a discussion by Cuvier, respecting the existence of the unicorn, or of any animal similar to that here described, with a single horn.He remarks, that the only single-horned quadruped of which we have anycertain knowledge, is the rhinoceros, and that the only horns which havebeen discovered, and which can have been single horns, belong to it. Thereare five animals mentioned by the ancients, as having single horns, the Indian ass, the single-horned horse, the single-horned ox, the monoceros,described in the text, and the oryx of Africa, which Pliny speaks of in c.79 of this Book, and in B. xi. c. 106. There are many curious accountsgiven by travellers of acknowledged veracity, respecting animals seen inthe more remote parts of Asia and Africa, answering to the description ofthe unicorn, and there are representations of the same in ancient sculptures;but they do not amount to that kind of evidence which can at all supplythe place of direct proof.ÑB.</p></body>
