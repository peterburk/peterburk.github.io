<div2 type="chapter" n="77" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 77.—A COMPARATIVE VIEW OF NATURE AS SHE APPEARS INDIFFERENT COUNTRIES. THE COMPARATIVE VALUES OF THINGS.</head><p>Having now treated of all the works of Nature, it will beas well to take a sort of comparative view of her several productions,as well as the countries which supply them. Throughoutthe whole earth, then, and wherever the vault of heavenextends, there is no country so beautiful, or which, for the productionsof Nature, merits so high a rank as Italy, that rulerand second parent of the world; recommended as she is byher men, her women, her generals, her soldiers, her slaves,her superiority in the arts, and the illustrious examples ofgenius which she has produced. Her situation, too, is equallyin her favour; the salubrity and mildness of her climate; theeasy access which she offers to all nations; her coasts indentedwith so many harbours; the propitious breezes, too, that alwaysprevail on her shores; advantages, all of them, due to her situation,lying, as she does, midway between the East and the West,and extended in the most favourable of all positions. Add tothis, the abundant supply of her waters, the salubrity of hergroves, the repeated intersections of her mountain ranges, thecomparative innocuousness of her wild animals, the fertility ofher soil, and the singular richness of her pastures.</p><p>Whatever there is that the life of man ought not to feel inwant of, is nowhere to be found in greater perfection thanhere; the cereals, for example, wine, oil, wool, flax, tissues,and oxen. As to horses, there are none, I find, preferred tothose of Italy for the course;<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> while, for mines of gold, silver,<pb n="6465" />copper, and iron, so long as it was deemed lawful to workthem,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> Italy was held inferior to no country whatsoever. Atthe present day, teeming as she is with these treasures, shecontents herself with lavishing upon us, as the whole of herbounties, her various liquids, and the numerous flavours yieldedby her cereals and her fruits. Next to Italy, if we except thefabulous regions of India, I would rank Spain, for my ownpart, those districts, at least, that lie in the vicinity of the sea.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>She is parched and sterile in one part, it is true; but whereshe is at all productive, she yields the cereals in abundance,oil, wine, horses, and metals of every kind. In all these respects,Gaul is her equal, no doubt; but Spain, on the otherhand, outdoes the Gallic provinces in her spartum<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and herspecular stone,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> the products of her desert tracts, in her pigmentsthat minister to our luxuries, in the ardour displayed byher people in laborious employments, in the perfect trainingof her slaves, in the robustness of body of her men, and intheir general resoluteness of character.</p><p>As to the productions themselves, the greatest value ofall, among the products of the sea, is attached to pearls:of objects that lie upon the surface of the earth, it is crystalsthat are most highly esteemed: and of those derived fromthe interior, adamas,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> smaragdus,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> precious stones, and murrhine,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>are the things upon which the highest value is placed.The most costly things that are matured by the earth, arethe kermes-berry<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> and laser;<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> that are gathered from trees,nard<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> and Seric tissues;<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> that are derived from the trunks oftrees, logs of citrus<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>-wood; that are produced by shrubs, cin-<pb n="6466" />namon,<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> cassia,<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> and amomum;<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> that are yielded by the juicesof trees or of shrubs, amber,<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> opobalsamum,<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> myrrh,<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> and frankincense;<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span>that are found in the roots of trees, the perfumesderived from costus.<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> The most valuable products furnishedby living animals, on land, are the teeth of elephants; byanimals in the sea, tortoise-shell; by the coverings of animals,the skins which the Seres<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> dye, and the substance gatheredfrom the hair of the she-goats of Arabia, which we havespoken of under the name of "ladanum;"<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span> by creatures thatare common to both land and sea, the purple<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span> of the murex.With reference to the birds, beyond plumes for warriors' helmets,and the grease that is derived from the geese of Commagene,<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span>I find no remarkable product mentioned.
