The blood, too, of ahe-goat is prepared and taken with the food. For persons suffering from asthma, the most efficient remedy of all is the bloodof wild horses<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> taken in drink; and next to that, asses' milkboiled with bulbs, the whey being the part used, with theaddition of nasturtium steeped in water and tempered withhoney, in the proportion of one cyathus of nasturtium to threesemi-sextarii of whey. The liver or lights of a fox, taken inred wine, or bear's gall in water, facilitate the respiration.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. viii. c. 16.</p></body>
