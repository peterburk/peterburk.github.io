We then come to the Aleian Plains<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>, thetown of Cassipolis, Mopsos<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span>, a free town on the river Pyramus,Thynos, Zephyrium, and Anchiale<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span>. Next to these<pb n="1448" />are the rivers Saros<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> and Cydnus<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span>, the latter of which, atsome distance from the sea, runs through the free city ofTarsus, the region of Celenderitis with a town<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> of similarname, the place where Nymphæum<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> stood, Soli of Cilicia<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span>,now called Pompeiopolis, Adana<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span>, Cibyra<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span>, Pinare<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span>, Pedalie<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span>,Ale, Selinus<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span>, Arsinoë<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span>, Iotape<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span>, Doron, and, near the sea,<pb n="1449" />Corycos, there being a town<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span>, port, and cave<span id="ref_31"><a href="#note_31">[31]</a></span> all of the samename. Passing these, we come to the river Calycadnus<span id="ref_32"><a href="#note_32">[32]</a></span>,the Promontory of Sarpedon<span id="ref_33"><a href="#note_33">[33]</a></span>, the towns of Holmœ<span id="ref_34"><a href="#note_34">[34]</a></span> andMyle, and the Promontory and town of Venus<span id="ref_35"><a href="#note_35">[35]</a></span>, at a shortdistance from the island of Cyprus. On the mainland thereare the towns of Myanda, Anemurium<span id="ref_36"><a href="#note_36">[36]</a></span>, and Coracesium<span id="ref_37"><a href="#note_37">[37]</a></span>,and the river Melas<span id="ref_38"><a href="#note_38">[38]</a></span>, the ancient boundary of Cilicia. Inthe interior the places more especially worthy of mentionare Anazarbus<span id="ref_39"><a href="#note_39">[39]</a></span>, now called Cæsarea, Augusta, Castabala<span id="ref_40"><a href="#note_40">[40]</a></span>,Epiphania<span id="ref_41"><a href="#note_41">[41]</a></span>, formerly called Œniandos, Eleusa<span id="ref_42"><a href="#note_42">[42]</a></span>, Iconium<span id="ref_43"><a href="#note_43">[43]</a></span>,<pb n="1450" />Seleucia<span id="ref_44"><a href="#note_44">[44]</a></span> upon the river Calycadnus, surnamed Tracheotis,a city removed<span id="ref_45"><a href="#note_45">[45]</a></span> from the sea-shore, where it had the name ofHolmia. Besides those already mentioned, there are in theinterior the rivers Liparis<span id="ref_46"><a href="#note_46">[46]</a></span>, Bombos, Paradisus, and MountImbarus<span id="ref_47"><a href="#note_47">[47]</a></span>.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">So called probably from the Greek <foreign lang="greek">diafanh\s,</foreign> "transparent." It has not been identified, but it was no doubt a small stream falling into the Gulf of Issus.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "Passes." As to Mount Amanus, see C. 18 of the present Book.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Parisot suggests that this is the Chersos of Xenophon, the modern Kermes.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Deli-Su of modern times according to D'Anville, the Maher-Su according to Pococke.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny is the only writer that mentions this river Lycus.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Gulf of Issos is now called the Gulf of Scanderoon or Iskenderun, from the town of that name, the former Alexandria ad Issum, mentioned here by Pliny. In the vicinity of Issus, Alexander defeated the army of Darius. The exact site of the town appears not to have been ascertained.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Which still preserves its name in Iskenderun, on the east side of the Gulf. It probably received its name in honour of Alexander the Great.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or the "Green" River. Its identity is unknown.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called Ayas Kala or Kalassy. It was a place, in the Roman period, of some importance.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The modern river Jihan.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "Passes" of Cilicia, through the range of Taurus.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Called Mallo in modern times, according to Hardouin and Dupinet.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">At the mouth of the Pyramus, according to Tzetzes.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Famous as the birth-place of St. Paul, the Apostle of the Gentiles. Its ruins still bear the name of Tersus. During the civil war it took part with Julius Cæsar, and from him received the name of Juliopolis.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">They lie between the rivers Djihoun and Syhoun, according to Ansart.</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called Messis, according to D'Anville and Mannert. The site of Cassipolis, or Cassiopolis according to some readings, is unknown.</p><p><span id="note_17"><a href="#ref_17">17. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The sites of Thynos and Zephyrium appear to be unknown. Anchiale was situate on the coast, upon the river Anchialcus, according to the geographer Stephanus. Aristobulus, quoted by Strabo, says that at this place was the tomb of Sardanapalus, and on it a relief in stone representing a man snapping the fingers of the right hand. He adds, "It is said that there is an Assyrian inscription also, recording that Sardanapalus built Anchiale and Tarsus in one day, and exhorting the reader to eat, drink, &amp;c., as everything else is not worth That, the meaning of which was shown by the attitude of the figure." Athenæus however cites Amyntas as his authority for stating that the tomb of Sardanapalus was at Nineveh. Leake is of opinion that a mound on the banks of the river beyond the modern villages of Kazalu and Karaduar forms the remains of Anchiale.</p><p><span id="note_18"><a href="#ref_18">18. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The modern Syhou, according to Ansart.</p><p><span id="note_19"><a href="#ref_19">19. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called the Tersoos Chai. It is remarkable for the coldness of its waters, and it was here that Alexander the Great nearly met with his death from bathing when heated, in the stream.</p><p><span id="note_20"><a href="#ref_20">20. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Chelendreh. It was a strong place on the coast, situate on a high rock nearly surrounded by the sea. None of its ruins seem older than the early period of the Roman empire. The Turks call it Gulnare.</p><p><span id="note_21"><a href="#ref_21">21. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably so called from a temple to the Sea Nymphs there.</p><p><span id="note_22"><a href="#ref_22">22. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">To distinguish it from Solæ or Soli of Cyprus. It was situate between the rivers Cydnus and Lamus, and was said to have been colonized by Argives and Lydians from Rhodes. Alexander mulcted its inhabitants of 200 talents, for their adhesion to the Persians. It was celebrated as the birth-place of the Stoic philosopher Chrysippus, the comic poet Philemon, and the poet and astronomer Aratus. Its name is perpetuated in the word <hi rend="ital">Solecism,</hi> which is said to have been first applied to the corrupt dialect of Greek spoken by the inhabitants of this city, or as some say, of Soli in Cyprus.</p><p><span id="note_23"><a href="#ref_23">23. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It still retains its ancient name, and is situate on the western side of the Sarus, now the Syhoun or Syhan. Pompey settled here some of the Cilician pirates whom he had conquered.</p><p><span id="note_24"><a href="#ref_24">24. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Leake, in his 'Asia Minor,' p. 196, says, "The vestiges of Cibyra are probably those observed by Captain Beaufort upon a height which rises from the right bank of a considerable river about eight miles to the eastward of the Melas, about four miles to the west of Cape Karáburnu, and nearly two miles from the shore." Ptolemy mentions Cibyra as an inland town of Cilicia Trachea, but Scylax places it on the coast.</p><p><span id="note_25"><a href="#ref_25">25. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Its ruins are still called Pinara or Minara. It was an inland city of Lycia, some distance west of the river Xanthus, and at the foot of Mount Cragus.</p><p><span id="note_26"><a href="#ref_26">26. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or perhaps 'Podalie.' Of it nothing seems to be known.</p><p><span id="note_27"><a href="#ref_27">27. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or Selinuntum, now Selenti, on the coast of Cilicia. In consequence of the death here of the Emperor Trajan, it received the name of Trajanopolis. Of Ale, if that is the correct reading, nothing whatever is known.</p><p><span id="note_28"><a href="#ref_28">28. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">On the coast of Cilicia; mentioned by Strabo as having a port. Leake places it at or near the ruined castle called Sokhta Kalesi, below which is a port, and a peninsula on the east side of the harbour covered with ruins.</p><p><span id="note_29"><a href="#ref_29">29. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In the district of Selenitis. It has been identified with the site of the modern fortress of Lambardo. It is also suggested that it may have been the same place as Laerte, the native city of Diogenes Laertius. Of Doron nothing seems to be known.</p><p><span id="note_30"><a href="#ref_30">30. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Its ruins are supposed to be those seen by Leake near the island of Crambusa. Here the walls of an ancient city may still be traced, and a mole of unhewn rocks projects from one angle of the fortress about 100 yards across the bay.</p><p><span id="note_31"><a href="#ref_31">31. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Strabo describes this cave as a vast hollow of circular form, surrounded by a margin of rock on all sides of considerable height; on descending it, the ground was found full of shrubs, both evergreens and cultivated, and in some parts the best saffron was grown. He also says that there was a cave which contained a large spring, from which arose a river of clear water which immediately afterwards sank into the earth and flowed underground into the sea. It was called the Bitter Water. This cave, so famed in ancient times, does not appear to have been examined by any modem traveller. It was said to have been the bed of the giant Typhon or Typhœus.</p><p><span id="note_32"><a href="#ref_32">32. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now known as the Ghiuk-Su.</p><p><span id="note_33"><a href="#ref_33">33. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Supposed to be the same as the modern Lessan-el-Kahpeh.</p><p><span id="note_34"><a href="#ref_34">34. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or Holmi, on the coast of Cilicia Tracheia, a little to the south-west of Seleucia. Leake thinks that the modern town of Aghaliman occupies the site of Holmœ.</p><p><span id="note_35"><a href="#ref_35">35. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably the same place as the Aphrodisias mentioned by Livy, Diodorus Siculus, and Ptolemy.</p><p><span id="note_36"><a href="#ref_36">36. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">On the headland now called Cape Anemour, the most southerly part of Asia Minor. Beaufort discovered on the point indications of a considerable ancient town.</p><p><span id="note_37"><a href="#ref_37">37. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Its site is now called Alaya or Alanieh. This spot was Strabo's boundary-line between Pamphylia and Cilicia. Some slight remains of the ancient town were seen here by Beaufort, but no inscriptions were found.</p><p><span id="note_38"><a href="#ref_38">38. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Identified by Beaufort with the modern Manaugat-Su.</p><p><span id="note_39"><a href="#ref_39">39. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">So called, either from an adjacent mountain of that name, or its founder, Anazarbus. Its later name was Cæsarea ad Anazarbum. Its site is called Anawasy or Amnasy, and is said to display considerable remains of the ancient town. Of Augusta nothing is known: Ptolemy places it in a district called Bryelice.</p><p><span id="note_40"><a href="#ref_40">40. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Identified by Ainsworth with the ruins seen at Kara Kaya in Cilicia.</p><p><span id="note_41"><a href="#ref_41">41. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pompey settled some of the Cilician pirates here after his defeat of them. It was thirty miles east of Anazarbus, but its site does not appear to have been identified.</p><p><span id="note_42"><a href="#ref_42">42. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">An island off the shore of Cilicia, also called Sebaste.</p><p><span id="note_43"><a href="#ref_43">43. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Some of the MSS. read "Riconium" here.</p><p><span id="note_44"><a href="#ref_44">44. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Its ruins are called Selefkeh. This was an important city of Seleucia Aspera, built by Seleucus I. on the western bank of the river Calycadnus. It had an oracle of Apollo, and annual games in honour of Zeus Olympius. It was a free city under the Romans. It was here that Frederick Barbarossa, the emperor of Germany, died. Its ruins are picturesque and extensive.</p><p><span id="note_45"><a href="#ref_45">45. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Meaning that the inhabitants of Holmia were removed by Seleucus to his new city of Seleucia.</p><p><span id="note_46"><a href="#ref_46">46. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Said by Vitruvius to have had the property of anointing those who bathed in its waters. If so, it probably had its name from the Greek word <foreign lang="greek">liparo\s,</foreign> "fat." It flowed past the town of Soloë. Bombos and Paradisus are rivers which do not appear to have been identified.</p><p><span id="note_47"><a href="#ref_47">47. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A branch of the Taurus range.</p></body>
