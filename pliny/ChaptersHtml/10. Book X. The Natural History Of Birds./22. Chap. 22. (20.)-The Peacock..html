<div2 type="chapter" n="22" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 22. (20.)â€”THE PEACOCK.</head><p>We shall now speak of the second class of birds, which isdivided into two kinds; those which give omens<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> by their note,and those which afford presages by their flight. The variation of the note in the one, and the relative size in the other,constitute the differences between them. These last, therefore,shall be treated of first, and the peacock shall have precedenceof all the rest, as much for its singular beauty as its superiorinstinct, and the vanity it displays.</p><p>When it hears itself praised, this bird spreads out its gorgeous colours, and especially if the sun happens to be shiningat the time, because then they are seen in all their radiance,and to better advantage. At the same time, spreading out itstail in the form of a shell, it throws the reflection upon theother feathers, which shine all the more brilliantly when ashadow is cast upon them; then at another moment it willcontract all the eyes<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> depicted upon its feathers in a single<pb n="2496" />mass, manifesting great delight in having them admired bythe spectator. The peacock loses its tail every year at the fallof the leaf, and a new one shoots forth in its place at theflower season; between these periods the bird is abashed andmoping, and seeks retired spots. The peacock lives twenty-five years, and begins to show its colours in the third. Bysome authors it is stated that this bird is not only a vain creature, but of a spiteful disposition also, just in the same waythat they attribute bashfulness to the goose.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> The characteristics, however, which they have thus ascribed to these birds,appear to me to be utterly unfounded.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Oscines" and "alites." This was a distinction made by theaugurs, but otherwise of little utility, as all the birds with a note fly aswell.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See the story of the eyes of Argus transferred to the peacock's tail.Ovid, Met, B. i 1. 616.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It would be curious to know how the goose manifests its modesty,or "verecundia." We are equally at a loss with Pliny to discover it.</p></body>
