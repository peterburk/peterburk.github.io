(17.)—FOUR VARIETIES OF THE ELM.</head><p>Midway between the preceding ones and the fruit-treesstands the elm, partaking of the nature of the former in itswood, and being akin to the latter in the friendship which itmanifests for the vine.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> The Greeks distinguish two varieties ofthis tree: the mountain<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> elm, which is the larger of the two,and that of the plains, which is more shrubby. Italy givesthe name of "Atinia"<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> to the more lofty kinds, and gives thepreference to those which are of a dry nature and will notgrow in damp localities. Another variety is the Gallic elm,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>and a third, the Italian,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> with leaves lying closer together, andspringing in greater numbers from a single stalk. A fourthkind is the wild elm. The Atinia does not produce anysamara,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> that being the name given to the seed of the elm.All the elms will grow from slips or cuttings, and all of them,with the exception of the Atinia, may be propagated fromseed.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Although (in common, too, with other trees) it is used as a support forthe vine, that does not any the more make it of the same nature as thefruit-trees.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Ulmus effuse of Willdenow; the Ulmus montana of Smith: <hi rend="ital">Flor.</hi><hi rend="ital">Brit.</hi></p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Ulmus campestris of Linnæus; the Ulmus marita of other betanists.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The ordinary elm, Fée thinks.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A variety of the Ulmus campestris, probably.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This name is still preserved by botanists. Pliny is incorrect in sayingthat the large elm produces no seed, the only difference being that the seedis smaller than in the other kinds. Columella, B. v. c. 6, contradicts thestatement here made by Pliny, but says that it <hi rend="ital">appears</hi> to be sterile, incomparison with the others.</p></body>
