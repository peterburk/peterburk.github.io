<div2 type="chapter" n="7" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 7.ÑAT WHAT PERIOD MURRHINE VESSELS WERE FIRST INTRODUCEDAT ROME. INSTANCES OF LUXURY IN REFERENCE TO THEM.</head><p>It was the same conquest, too, that first introduced murrhine<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>vessels at Rome; Pompeius being the first to dedicate, atthe conclusion of this triumph, vases and cups, made of thismaterial, in the Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus: a circumstancewhich soon brought them into private use, waiters, even, andeating-utensils made of murrhine being in great request.This species of luxury, too, is daily on the increase, a singlecup, which would hold no more than three sextarii, havingbeen purchased at the price of seventy thousand sesterces. Aperson of consular rank, who some years<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> ago used to drinkout of this cup, grew so passionately fond of it, as to gnaw its<pb n="6393" />edges even, an injury, however, which has only tended to enhanceits value: indeed there is now no vessel in murrhine thathas ever been estimated at a higher figure than this. Wemay form some opinion how much money this same personageswallowed up in articles of this description, from the fact thatthe number of them was so great, that, when the EmperorNero deprived his children of them, and they were exposed topublic view, they occupied a whole theatre to themselves, inthe gardens beyond the Tiber; a theatre which was foundsufficiently large even, for the audience that attended on theoccasion when Nero<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> rehearsed his musical performances beforehis appearance in the Theatre of Pompeius. It was at thisexhibition, too, that I saw counted the broken fragments of asingle cup, which it was thought proper to preserve in an urnand display, I suppose, with the view of exciting the sorrowsof the world, and of exposing the cruelty of fortune; just asthough it had been no less than the body of Alexander theGreat himself!</p><p>T. Petronius,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> a personage of consular rank, intending, fromhis hatred of Nero, to disinherit the table of that prince, brokea murrhine basin, which had cost him no less than threehundred thousand sesterces. But Nero himself, as it was onlyproper for a prince to do, surpassed them all, by paying onemillion of sesterces for a single cup: a fact well worthy ofremembrance, that an emperor, the father of his country,should have drunk from a vessel of such costly price!</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Modern writers differ as to the material of which these vessels werecomposed. Some think that they were of variegated glass, and others ofonyx; but the more general opinion is, that they were Chinese porcelain,and we have the line in Propertius, B. iv. El. 5, 1. 26. "And murrhinevessels baked on Parthian hearths." Ajasson is of opinion, from the descriptiongiven by Pliny, that these vessels were made of Fluor spar, orfluate of lime. "Myrrhine" is another reading of the word.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Ante hos annos." Sillig is of opinion that the reading here shouldbe "L. Annius," and that L. Annius Bassus, who was Consul suffectus inthe year 70 A.D., is the person referred to; or possibly, T. Arrius Antoninus,who was Consul suffectus, A.D. <date value="69" authname="69">69</date>.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Gardens of Nero, in the Fourteenth Region of the City.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He had been formerly a sharer in the debaucheries of Nero.
