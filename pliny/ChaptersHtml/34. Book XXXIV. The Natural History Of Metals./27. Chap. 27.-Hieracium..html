<div2 type="chapter" n="27" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 27.—HIERACIUM.</head><p>"Hieracium"<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> is the name given to an eye-salve, which isessentially composed of the following ingredients; four ouncesof sal ammoniac, two of Cyprian verdigris, the same quantityof the kind of copperas which is called "chalcanthum,"<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> oneounce of misy<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and six of saffron; all these substances beingpounded together with Thasian vinegar and made up intopills. It is an excellent remedy for incipient glaucoma andcataract, as also for films upon the eyes, eruptions, albugo,and diseases of the eye-lids. Verdigris, in a crude state, isalso used as an ingredient in plasters for wounds. In combinationwith oil, it is wonderfully efficacious for ulcerationsof the mouth and gums, and for sore lips. Used in the formof a cerate, it acts detergently upon ulcers, and promotes theircicatrization. Verdigris also consumes the callosities of fistulasand excrescences about the anus, either used by itself,applied with sal ammoniac, or inserted in the fistula in theform of a salve. The same substance, kneaded with one thirdpart of resin of turpentine, removes leprosy.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">According to Celsus, this substance obtained its name from the personwho invented or compounded it; he calls it "Collyrium of Hierax."—B.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Atramenti sutorii, quod chalcanthum vocant." We may presume thatthis substance was somewhat different from the "atramentum sutorium"mentioned in the last Chapter: the word "chalcanthum" means "flower ofcopper;" <foreign lang="greek">xalkou= a)/nqos</foreign>.—B. Delafosse identifies it with blue vitriol,sulphate, or hydro-trisulphate of copper.
