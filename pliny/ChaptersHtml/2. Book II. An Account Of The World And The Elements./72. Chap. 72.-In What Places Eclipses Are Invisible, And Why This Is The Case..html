<div2 type="chapter" n="72" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 72.—IN WHAT PLACES ECLIPSES ARE INVISIBLE, ANDWHY THIS IS THE CASE.</head><p>Hence it is that the inhabitants of the east do not seethose eclipses of the sun or of the moon which occur in theevening, nor the inhabitants of the west those in the morning, while such as take place at noon are more frequentlyvisible<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>. We are told, that at the time of the famous victory ofAlexander the Great, at Arbela<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>, the moon waseclipsed at the second hour of the night, while, in Sicily, themoon was rising at the same hour. The eclipse of the sunwhich occurred the day before the calends of May, in theconsulship of Vipstanus and Fonteius<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>, not many years ago,was seen in Campania between the seventh and eighth hourof the day; the general Corbulo informs us, that it was seen<pb n="1105" />in Armenia, between the eleventh and twelfth hour<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>; thus thecurve of the globe both reveals and conceals different objectsfrom the inhabitants of its different parts. If the earth hadbeen flat, everything would have been seen at the same time,from every part of it, and the nights would not have beenunequal; while the equal intervals of twelve hours, which arenow observed only in the middle of the earth, would in thatcase have been the same everywhere.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We may presume that the author meant to convey the idea, thatthe eclipses which are visible in any one country are not so in thosewhich are situated under a different meridian. The terms"vespertinos," "matutinos," and "meridianos," refer not to the timeof the day,but to the situation of the eclipse, whether recurring in the western,eastern, or southern parts of the heavens.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Brewster, in the art. "Chronology," p. 415, mentions this eclipse ashaving taken place Sept. 21st, U.C. 331, eleven days beforethe battle ofArbela; while, in the same art. p. 423, the battle is said to have takenplace on Oct. 2nd, eleven days after a total eclipse of the moon.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It took place on the 30th of April, in the year of the City 811,A.D. <date value="59" authname="59">59</date>; see Brewster, <hi rend="ital">ubi supra.</hi> It is simplymentioned by Tacitus,Ann. xiv. 12, as having occurred among other prodigies which took placeat this period.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We have an account of Corbulo's expedition to Armenia in Dion Cassius, lx. 19–24, but there is no mention of the eclipse or of any peculiarcelestial phænomenon.</p></body>
