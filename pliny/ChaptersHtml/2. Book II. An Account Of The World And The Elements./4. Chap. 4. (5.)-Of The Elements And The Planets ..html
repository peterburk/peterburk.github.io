(5.)—OF THE ELEMENTS<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> AND THE PLANETS<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>.</head><p>I do not find that any one has doubted that there arefour elements. The highest of these is supposed to be fire,and hence proceed the eyes of so many glittering stars. Thenext is that spirit, which both the Greeks and ourselves callby the same name, air<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>. It is by the force of this vital principle,pervading all things and mingling with all, that theearth, together with the fourth element, water, is balanced in<pb n="1019" />the middle of space. These are mutually bound together, thelighter being restrained by the heavier, so that they cannotfly off; while, on the contrary, from the lighter tending upwards, the heavier are so suspended, that they cannot falldown. Thus, by an equal tendency in an opposite direction,each of them remains in its appropriate place, bound togetherby the never-ceasing revolution of the world, which alwaysturning on itself, the earth falls to the lowest part and is inthe middle of the whole, while it remains suspended in thecentre<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, and, as it were, balancing this centre, in which it issuspended. So that it alone remains immoveable, whilst allthings revolve round it, being connected with every otherpart, whilst they all rest upon it.</p><p>(6.) Between this body and the heavens there are suspended, inthis aërial spirit, seven stars<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>, separated by determinatespaces, which, on account of their motion, we call wander-<pb n="1020" />ing, although, in reality, none are less so<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>. The sun is carriedalong in the midst of these, a body of great size and power,the ruler, not only of the seasons and of the different climates,but also of the stars themselves and of the heavens<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>. Whenwe consider his operations, we must regard him as the life,or rather the mind of the universe, the chief regulator andthe God of nature; he also lends his light to the other stars<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>.He is most illustrious and excellent, beholding all thingsand hearing all things, which, I perceive, is ascribed to himexclusively by the prince of poets, Homer<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The account of the elements, of their nature, difference, and, moreespecially, the necessity of their being four, are fully discussed byAristotle in various parts of his works, more particularly in his treatiseDe Cœlo, lib. iii. cap. 3, 4 and 5, lib. iv. cap. 5, and De Gener. et Cor.lib. ii. cap. 2, 3, 4 and 5. For a judicious summary of the opinions ofAristotle on this subject, I may refer to Stanley's History of Philosophy;Aristotle, doctrines of, p. 2. 1. 7, and to <placeName key="tgn,7014117" authname="tgn,7014117">Enfield</placeName>, i. 764 <hi rend="ital">et seq.</hi> Forthe Epicurean doctrine, see Lucretius, i. 764 <hi rend="ital">et seq.</hi></p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Although the word <hi rend="ital">planeta,</hi> as taken from the Greek <foreign lang="greek">planh/ths,</foreign> isinserted in the title of this chapter, it does not occur in any part of thetext.

The word <hi rend="ital">sidus</hi> is used, in most cases, for one of theheavenly bodies generally, sometimes for what we term a constellation,a particular assemblage of them, and sometimes specially for an individualstar. Manilius employs the word in all these senses, as will appear bythe three following passages respectively; the first taken from the opening of his poem,<lb />"<placeName key="tgn,2103126" authname="tgn,2103126">Carmine</placeName> divinas artes, et conscia fati<lb />Sidera...."<lb />The second, "Hæc igitur texunt æquali sidera tractu<lb />Ignibus in varias cœlum laqueantia formas." i. 275, 276.<lb />The third "....pectus, fulgenti sidere clarius;"i. 356.<lb /><p>In the Fasti of <placeName key="tgn,2562922" authname="tgn,2562922">Ovid</placeName>, we have examples of the two latter of thesesignifications:—<lb />"Ex Ariadnæo sidere nosse potes;" v. 346.<lb />"Et canis (Icarium dicunt) quo sidere noto<lb />Tosta sitit tellus;" iv. 939, 940.<lb />Lucretius appears always to employ the term in the general sense. J.Obsequens applies the word <hi rend="ital">sidus</hi> to a meteor; "sidus ingens cœlodemissum," cap. 16. In a subsequent part of this book, chap. 18 <hi rend="ital">et seq.,</hi>our author more particularly restricts the term <hi rend="ital">sidus</hi> to the planets.</p></p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot"><placeName key="tgn,2036187" authname="tgn,2036187">Cicero</placeName> remarks concerning them; "quæ (stellæ) falso vocanturerrantes; "De Nat.
