<div2 type="chapter" n="19" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 19. (13.)—LABYRINTHS.</head><p>We must speak also of the Labyrinths, the most stupendousworks, perhaps, on which mankind has expended its labours;and not for chimerical purposes, merely, as might possibly besupposed.</p><p>There is still in Egypt, in the Nome of Heracleopolites,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> alabyrinth,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> which was the first constructed, three thousandsix hundred years ago, they say, by King Petesuchis orTithöes: although, according to Herodotus, the entire workwas the production of no less than twelve kings, the last of<pb n="6340" />whom was Psammetichus. As to the purpose for which itwas built, there are various opinions: Demoteles says that itwas the palace of King Moteris, and Lyceas that it was the tombof Mœris, while many others assert that it was a buildingconsecrated to the Sun, an opinion which mostly prevails.</p><p>That Dædalus took this for the model of the Labyrinthwhich he constructed in Crete, there can be no doubt; thoughhe only reproduced the hundredth part of it, that portion,namely, which encloses circuitous passages, windings, andinextricable galleries which lead to and fro. We must not,comparing this last to what we see delineated on our mosaicpavements, or to the mazes<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> formed in the fields for theamusement of children, suppose it to be a narrow promenadealong which we may walk for many miles together; but wemust picture to ourselves a building filled with numerousdoors, and galleries which continually mislead the visitor,bringing him back, after all his wanderings, to the spot fromwhich he first set out. This<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> Labyrinth is the second, that ofEgypt being the first. There is a third in the Isle ofLemnos, and a fourth in Italy.</p><p>They are all of them covered with arched roofs of polishedstone; at the entrance, too, of the Egyptian Labyrinth, a thingthat surprises me, the building is constructed of Parian marble,while throughout the other parts of it the columns are ofsyenites.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> With such solidity is this huge mass constructed,that the lapse of ages has been totally unable to destroy it,seconded as it has been by the people of Heracleopolites, whohave marvellously ravaged a work which they have alwaysheld in abhorrence. To detail the position of this work andthe various portions of it is quite impossible, it being sub-<pb n="6341" />divided into regions and præfectures, which are styled nomes,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>thirty in number, with a vast palace assigned to each. Inaddition to these, it should contain temples of all the gods ofEgypt, and forty statues of Nemesis<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> in as many sacredshrines; besides numerous pyramids, forty ells<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> in height, andcovering six aruræ<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> at the base. Fatigued with wanderingto and fro, the visitor is sure to arrive at some inextricablecrossing or other of the galleries. And then, too, there arebanquetting rooms situate at the summit of steep ascents;porticos from which we descend by flights of ninety steps;columns in the interior, made of porphyrites;<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> figures of gods;statues of kings; and effigies of hideous monsters. Some ofthe palaces are so peculiarly constructed, that the moment thedoors are opened a dreadful sound like that of thunder reverberateswithin: the greater part, too, of these edifices have to betraversed in total darkness. Then again, without the walls ofthe Labyrinth, there rises another mass of buildings known asthe "Pteron;"<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> beneath which there are passages excavatedleading to other subterranean palaces. One person, and onlyone, has made some slight repairs to the Labyrinth; Chæremon,<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>an eunuch of King Necthebis, who lived five hundredyears before the time of Alexander the Great. It is asserted,also, that while the arched roofs of squared stone were beingraised, he had them supported by beams of thorn<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> boiledin oil.</p><p>As for the Cretan Labyrinth, what I have already statedmust suffice for that. The Labyrinth of Lemnos<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> is similarto it, only that it is rendered more imposing by itshundred and fifty columns; the shafts of which, when in thestone-yard, were so nicely balanced, that a child was able tomanage the wheel of the lathe in turning them. The archi-<pb n="6342" />tects were, Smilis,<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> Rhœcus,<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> and Theodorus, natives of theisland, and there are still in existence some remains of it;whereas of the Cretan Labyrinth and of that in Italy not avestige is left.</p><p>As to this last, which Porsena, King of Etruria, erected ashis intended sepulchre, it is only proper that I should makesome mention of it, if only to show that the vanity displayedby foreign monarchs, great as it is, has been surpassed. Butas the fabulousness of the story connected with it quite exceedsall bounds, I shall employ the words given by M. Varrohimself in his account of it:—"Porsena was buried," says he,"beneath the city of Clusium;<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> in the spot where he had hadconstructed a square monument, built of squared stone. Eachside of this monument was three hundred feet in length andfifty in height, and beneath the base, which was also square,there was an inextricable labyrinth, into which if any oneentered without a clew of thread, he could never find his wayout. Above this square building there stand five pyramids,one at each corner, and one in the middle, seventy-five feetbroad at the base, and one hundred and fifty feet in height.These pyramids are so tapering in their form, that upon thesummit of all of them united there rests a brazen globe, andupon that a petasus;<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> from which there hang, suspended bychains, bells, which make a tinkling when agitated by thewind, like what was done at Dodona<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> in former times. Uponthis globe there are four other pyramids, each one hundredfeet in height; and above them is a single platform, on whichthere are five more pyramids,"<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span>—the height of which Varro hasevidently felt ashamed to add; but, according to the Etruscanfables, it was equal to that of the rest of the building. What<pb n="6343" />downright madness this, to attempt to seek glory at an outlaywhich can never be of utility to any one; to say nothing ofexhausting the resources of the kingdom, and after all, thatthe artist may reap the greater share of the praise!</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. v. c. 9.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The site of this labyrinth has not been traced, but Sir G.

There are many caverns ofthis nature in Crete, and one near Gortyna, at Hagios-Deka, is replete withgalleries and intricate windings similar to those ascribed to the Labyrinthof Dædalus.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See Chapter 13 of this Book.
