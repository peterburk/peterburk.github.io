In cases of asthma, millepedesare used, thrice seven of them being soaked in Attic honey,<pb n="5439" />and taken internally by the aid of a reed:<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> for all vessels, itshould be remembered, turn black on coming in contact withthem. Some persons grill one sextarius of these insects on aflat pan, till they become white, and then mix them withhoney. There are some authorities who call this insect a"centipede," and recommend it to be given in warm water.Snails are administered to persons subject to fainting fits,alienation of the senses, and vertigo: for which purposes, asnail is beaten up, shell and all, with three cyathi of raisinwine, and the mixture is administered warm with the drink,for nine days at most. Others, again, give one snail the firstday, two the second, three the third, two the fourth, and onethe fifth; a mode of treatment also adopted for the cure ofasthma and of abscesses.</p><p>There is, according to some authorities, an insect resembling the locust in appearance, destitute of wings, and knownby the Greek name of "troxallis," it being without a name inLatin: a considerable number of writers, however, considerit as identical with the insect known to us as "gryllus."<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>Twenty of these insects, they say, should be grilled, and takenin honied wine, by patients troubled with hardness of breathing or spitting of blood. Some persons pour pure grape-juice,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>or sea-water, upon unwashed snails, and then boil and eatthem for food; or else they bruise the snails, shells and all,and take them with this grape-juice. A similar method isalso adopted for the cure of cough. Honey in which the beeshave died, is particularly good for the cure of abscesses. Forspitting of blood a vulture's lungs are used, burnt upon vinelogs, and mixed with half the quantity of pomegranate blossoms, or with the same proportion of quince and lily blossom:the whole being taken morning and evening, in wine, if thereis no fever; but where there are symptoms of fever, instead ofwine, water is used in which quinces have been boiled.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See c. 12 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Our "cricket."
