It does not, however, live more than a singleday, from which circumstance it has obtained the name of" hemerobion."<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> The life of other insects of a similar natureis regulated from its beginning to its end by multiples ofseven. Thrice seven days is the duration of the life of thegnat and of the maggot, while those that are viviparous livefour times seven days, and their various changes and transfornations take place in periods of three or four days. The otherinsects of this kind that are winged, generally die in the<pb n="3043" />autumn, the gad-fly becoming quite blind<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> even before it dies.Flies which have been drowned in water, if they are coveredwith ashes,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> will return to life.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier thinks that he alludes to a variety of the ephemera or the phryganea of Linnæus, the case-wing flies, many of which are particularlyshort-lived. These are by no means peculiar to the river Bog or Hypanis.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"living for a day."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">They only <hi rend="ital">appear</hi> to be so, from the peculiar streaks on the eyes.Linnæus has hence called one variety, the Tabanus cæcutiens.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or with pounded chalk or whitening. Ælian adds, "if they are placedin the sun," which appears necessary for the full success of the experiment.Life appears to be suspended in such cases for a period of surprising length.</p></body>
