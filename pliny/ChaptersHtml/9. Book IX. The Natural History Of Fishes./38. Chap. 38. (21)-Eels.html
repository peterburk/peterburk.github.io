(21)—EELS</head><p>Eels live eight<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> years; they are able to survive out of wateras much as six days,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> when a north-east wind blows; but whenthe south wind prevails, not so many. In winter,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> they cannot live if they are in very shallow water, nor yet if the wateris troubled. Hence it is that they are taken more especiallyabout the rising of the Vergiliæ,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> when the rivers are mostlyin a turbid state. These animals seek their food at night;they are the only fish the bodies of which, when dead, do notfloat<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> upon the surface.</p><p>(22.) There is a lake called Benacus,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> in the territory ofVerona, in Italy, through which the river Mincius flows.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> Atthe part of it whence this river issues, once a year, and mostlyin the month of October, the lake is troubled, evidently by theconstellations<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> of autumn, and the eels are heaped together<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>by the waves, and rolled on by them in such astonishing multitudes, that single masses of them, containing more than athousand in number, are often taken in the chambers<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> whichare formed in the bed of the river for that purpose.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Spallanzani, in his "Nat.

B. viii. c. 75, says the same, and likewise thatthey feed <hi rend="ital">mostly</hi> at night. The reason for their not floating when dead, hesays, is their peculiar conformation; the belly being so remarkably smallthat the water cannot find an entrance; added to which they have no fatupon them.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. iii. c. 23.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. iii. c. 20.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The setting of the Pleiades or the rising of Arcturus.
