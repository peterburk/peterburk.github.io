(11.)ÑAN EFFECTUAL WAY OF PUTTING A STOP TO THESINGING OF BIRDS.</head><p>I must not omit here, in reference to painting, a celebratedstory that is told about Lepidus. During the Triumvirate,when he was entertained by the magistrates of a certain place,he had lodgings given him in a house that was wholly surroundedwith trees. The next day, he complained to them ina threatening tone, that he had been unable to sleep for thesinging of the birds there. Accordingly, they had a dragonpainted, on pieces of parchment of the greatest length thatcould possibly be obtained, and surrounded the grove with it;a thing that so terrified the birds, it is said, that they becamesilent at once; and hence it was that it first became knownhow this object could be attained.</p></div2></body>
