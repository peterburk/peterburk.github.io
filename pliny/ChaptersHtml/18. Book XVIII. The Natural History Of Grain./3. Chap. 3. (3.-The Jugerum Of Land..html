<div2 type="chapter" n="3" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 3. (3.—THE JUGERUM OF LAND.</head><p>That portion of land used to be known as a "jugerum,"<pb n="4005" />which was capable of being ploughed by a single "jugum," oryoke of oxen, in one day; an "actus"<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> being as much as theoxen could plough at a single spell, fairly estimated, withoutstopping. This last was one hundred and twenty feet in length;and two in length made a jugerum. The most considerablerecompense that could be bestowed upon generals and valiantcitizens, was the utmost extent of land around which a personcould trace a furrow with the plough in a single day. Thewhole population, too, used to contribute a quarter<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> of a sextarius of spelt, or else half a one, per head.</p><p>From agriculture the earliest surnames were derived. Thus,for instance, the name of Pilumnus was given to him who invented the "pilum," or pestle of the bake-house, for poundingcorn; that of Piso was derived from "piso," to grind corn;and those of Fabius, Lentulus, and Cicero, from the severalvarieties<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> of leguminous plants in the cultivation of which respectively these individuals excelled. One individual of thefamily of the Junii received the name of "Bubuleus,"<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> fromthe skill he displayed in breeding oxen. Among the sacredceremonials, too, there was nothing that was held more holythan the marriage by confarreation,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> and the woman justmarried used to present a cake made of spelt.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> Careless cultivation of the land was in those times an offence that cameunder the cognizance of the censors; and, as we learn fromCato,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> when it was said that such and such a man was a goodagriculturist or a good husbandman, it was looked upon as thevery highest compliment that could be paid him. A mancame to be called "locuples," or "rich," from being "lociplenus," or "full of earth." Money, too, received its nameof "pecunia,"<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> from "pecus," "cattle." At the present<pb n="4006" />day, even, in the registers of the censors, we find set downunder the head of "pascua," or "pasture lands," everythingfrom which the public revenues are derived, from the fact thatfor a long period of time pasture lands were the only sourcesof the public revenue. Fines, too, were only imposed in theshape of paying so many sheep or so many oxen; and the benevolent spirit of the ancient laws deserves remark, whichmost considerately enjoined that the magistrate, when he in-flicted a penalty, should never impose a fine of an ox beforehaving first condemned the same party to the payment of asheep.</p><p>Those who celebrated the public games in honour of the oxreceived the name of Bubetii.<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> King Servius was the firstwho impressed upon our copper coin<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> the figures of sheep andoxen. To depasture cattle secretly by night upon the unripecrops on plough lands, or to cut them in that state, was madeby the Twelve Tables<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> a capital offence in the case of anadult; and it was enacted that the person guilty of it shouldbe hanged, in order to make due reparation to the goddessCeres, a punishment more severe, even, than that inflicted formurder. If, on the other hand, the offender was not an adult,he was beaten at the discretion of the prætor; a penalty doublethe amount of the damage was also exacted.</p><p>The various ranks, too, and distinctions in the state had noother origin than the pursuits of agriculture. The ruraltribes held the foremost rank, and were composed of thosewho possessed lands; while those of the city, a place to whichit was looked upon as ignominious to be transferred, had thediscredit thrown upon them of being an indolent race. Henceit was that these last were only four in number, and receivedtheir names from the several parts of the City which they respectively inhabited; being the Suburran, the Palatine, Colline, and Exquiline tribes. Every ninth day<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> the rural tribesused to visit the city for the purpose of marketing, and it wasfor this reason that it was made illegal to hold the comitia upon<pb n="4007" />the Nundinaæ; the object being that the country people mightnot be called away thereby from the transaction of their business. In those days repose and sleep were enjoyed uponstraw. Even to glory itself, in compliment to corn, the namewas given of "adorea."<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span></p><p>For my own part, I greatly admire<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> the modes of expression employed in our ancient language: thus, for instance,we read in the Commentaries of the Priesthood to the follow-ing effect:—"For deriving an augury from the sacrifice of abitch,<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> a day should be set apart before the ear of corn appearsfrom out of the sheath,<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> and then again before it enters thesheath."</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Four Roman feet in width, and 120 in length.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Quartarius.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Faba," a bean; "Lens," a lentil; and "Cicer," a chick-pea.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A "bubus," from "oxen."
