The proper remedy for it is human ear-wax:a thing that we must not be surprised at, seeing that, if applied immediately, it is a cure for the stings of scorpions even,and serpents. The best, however, for this purpose, is thattaken from the ears of the wounded person. Agnails, too,it is said, may be cured in a similar manner. A human tooth,reduced to powder, is a cure, they say, for the sting of a serpent.</p></div2></body>
