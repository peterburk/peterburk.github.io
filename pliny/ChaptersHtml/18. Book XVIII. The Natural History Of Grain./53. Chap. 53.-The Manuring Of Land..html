<div2 type="chapter" n="53" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 53.—THE MANURING OF LAND.</head><p>The proper method of manuring is here a very importantsubject for consideration—we have already treated of it atsome length in the preceding Book.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> The only point that is<pb n="4069" />universally agreed upon is, that we must never sow withoutfirst manuring the ground; although in this respect even thereare certain rules to be observed. Millet, panic, rape, and turnips should never be sown in any but a manured soil. If, onthe other hand, the land is not manured, sow wheat there inpreference to barley. The same, too, with fallow lands;though in these it is generally recommended that beans shouldbe sown. It should be remembered, however, that whereverbeans are sown, the land should have been manured at as recent a period as possible. If it is intended to crop ground inautumn, care must be taken to plough in manure in the monthof September, just after rain has fallen. In the same way,too, if it is intended to sow in spring, the manure should bespread in the winter. It is the rule to give eighteen cart-loadsof manure to each jugerum, and to spread it well beforeploughing it in,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> or sowing the seed.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> If this manuring,however, is omitted, it will be requisite to spread the landwith aviary dust just before hoeing is commenced. To clearup any doubts with reference to this point, I would here observe that the fair price for a cart-load of manure is onedenarius; where, too, sheep furnish one cart-load, the largercattle should furnish ten:<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> unless this result is obtained, itis a clear proof that the husbandman has littered his cattlebadly.</p><p>There are some persons who are of opinion that the bestmethod of manuring land is to pen sheep there, with netserected to prevent them from straying. If land is not manured, it will get chilled; but if, on the other hand, it is over-manured, it becomes burnt up: it is a much better plan, too,to manure little and often than in excess. The warmer thesoil is by nature, the less manure it requires.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. xvii. c. 6.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Ares" seems to be a preferable reading to "arescat," "before it dries."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Schneider, upon Columella, B. ii. c. 15, would reject these words,and they certainly appear out of place.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Poinsinet would supply here "tricenis diebus," "in thirty days," fromColumella, B. ii. c. 15.</p></body>
