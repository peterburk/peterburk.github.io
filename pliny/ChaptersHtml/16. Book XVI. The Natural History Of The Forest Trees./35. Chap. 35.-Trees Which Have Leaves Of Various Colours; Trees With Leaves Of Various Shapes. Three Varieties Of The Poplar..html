<div2 type="chapter" n="35" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 35.ÑTREES WHICH HAVE LEAVES OF VARIOUS COLOURS;TREES WITH LEAVES OF VARIOUS SHAPES. THREE VARIETIESOF THE POPLAR.</head><p>The leaves continue the same upon every species of tree,<pb n="3376" />with the exception of the poplar, the ivy, and the croton,which we have already mentioned as being called the "cicus."<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span></p><p>(23.) There are three kinds of poplar; the white,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> theblack,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and the one known as the Libyan<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> poplar, with a verydiminutive leaf, and extremely black; much esteemed also forthe fungi which grow from it. The white poplar has a parti-coloured leaf, white on the upper side and green beneath.This poplar, as also the black variety, and the croton, have arounded leaf when young, as though it had been described witha pair of compasses, but when it becomes older the leaf throwsout angular projections. On the other hand, the leaf of theivy,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> which is angular at first, becomes rounder, the older thetree. From the leaves of the poplar there falls a very thickdown;<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> upon the white poplar, which, it is said, has a greaterquantity of leaves than the others, this down is quite white,resembling locks of wool. The leaves of the pomegranate andthe almond are red.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xv. c. 7.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Populus alba of Linn¾us.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Populus nigra of Linn¾us.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Populus tremula of Linn¾us.

The leaveson the young suckers or the old and sterile branches are divided into threeor five regular lobes, while those which grow on the branches destinedto bear the blossoms are ovals or lanceolated ovals in shape.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is not from the leaves, but from the fruit of the tree that this downfalls; the seeds being enveloped with a cottony substance. This passageis hopelessly corrupt.</p></body>
