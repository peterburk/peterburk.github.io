<div2 type="chapter" n="20" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 20. (24.)—THE EUPHRATES.</head><p>This place, too, will be the most appropriate one formaking some mention of the Euphrates. This river rises inCaranitis<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>, a præfecture of Greater Armenia, according tothe statement of those who have approached the nearest toits source. Domitius Corbulo says, that it rises in MountAba; Licinius Mucianus, at the foot of a mountain whichhe calls Capotes<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>, twelve miles above Zimara, and that at itssource it has the name of Pyxurates. It first flows pastDerxene<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>, and then Anaitica<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, shutting out<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> the regions ofArmenia from Cappadocia. Dascusa<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> is distant from Zimaraseventy-five miles; from this spot it is navigable as far as<pb n="1442" />Sartona<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>, a distance of fifty miles, thence to Melitene<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>, inCappadocia, distant seventy-four<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> miles, and thence to Elegia<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>,in Armenia, distant ten miles ; receiving in its course therivers Lycus<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>, Arsanias<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>, and Arsanus. At Elegia it meetsthe range of Mount Taurus, but no effectual resistance isoffered to its course, although the chain is here twelvemiles in width. At its passage<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> between the mountains,the river bears the name of Omma<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>; but afterwards, when ithas passed through, it receives that of Euphrates. Beyondthis spot it is full of rocks, and runs with an impetuoustide. It then divides that part of Arabia which is calledthe country of the Orei<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>, on the left, by a channel three<pb n="1443" />schœni<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> in width, from the territory of the Commageni<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> onthe right, and it admits of a bridge being thrown across it,even where it forces a passage through the range of Taurus.At Claudiopolis<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span>, in Cappadocia, it takes an easterly direction;and here, for the first time in this contest, Taurusturns it out of its course; though conquered before, andrent asunder by its channel, the mountain-chain now gainsthe victory in another way, and, breaking its career, compelsit to take a southerly direction. Thus is this warfareof nature equally waged,—the river proceeding onward tothe destination which it intends to reach, and the mountainsforbidding it to proceed by the path which it originallyintended. After passing the Cataracts<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span>, the river againbecomes navigable; and, at a distance of forty miles fromthence, is Samosata<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span>, the capital of Commagene.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In the western branch of the plateau of Iran, a portion of the Tauruschain. Considerable changes in the course of the lower portion of theriver have taken place since the time when Pliny wrote. Caranitis isthe modern Arzrum, or Erzrúm, of the Turks.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called Dujik Tagh, a mountain of Armenia.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It has been suggested, that the proper reading here would be<hi rend="ital">Xerxene.</hi></p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably the district where the goddess Anais was worshipped,who is mentioned by Pliny in B. xxxiii. c. 24.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From the place of confluence where the two mountain streamsforming the Euphrates unite. This spot is now known as KebbanMa'den.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A fortress upon the river Euphrates, in Lesser Armenia. Ithas been identified with the ferry and lead-mines of Kebban Ma'den,the points where the Kara Su is joined by the Myrad-Chaï, at a distanceof 270 miles from its source; the two streams forming, by their confluence,the Euphrates.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Other readings have "Pastona" here, said by D'Anville to be themodern Pastek.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Called the metropolis of Lesser Armenia by Procopius. It wassituate between Anti-Taurus and the Euphrates, and celebrated for itsfertility, more especially in fruit-trees, oil, and wine. The site of thecity Melitene is now called Malatiyah, on a tributary of the Euphrates,and near that river itself.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is generally supposed that "twenty-four" would be the correctreading here.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There were two places of this name. The one here spoken of was atown of Lesser Armenia, on the right bank of the Euphrates, at thefirst, or principal curve, which takes place before the river enters MountTaurus. It is represented by the modern Iz Oghlu.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">No other writer is found to make mention of the Lycus, whichflows into the Euphrates, though there is a river formerly so called, whichflows into the Tigris below Larissa, the modern Nimroud. D'Anvilleis of opinion, that it is formed from the numerous springs, called by thepeople of the district Bing-gheul, or the "Thousand Springs."</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called the Myrad-Chaï. Ritter considers it to be the southarm of the Euphrates. The Arsanus is mentioned by no writer exceptPliny.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The defile at this place is now called the Cataract of Nachour, accordingto Parisot.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The more general reading here is "Omira." Hardouin is of opinion,that this is the district referred to in the Book of Judith, ii. 24. In theVulgate, it appears to be twice called the river <hi rend="ital">&gt;Mambre;</hi> but in ourversion it is called  <hi rend="ital">Arbonaï.</hi></p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Burnouf has concluded, from a cuneiform inscription which hedeciphered, that the name of this people was Ayurâ, and that Hardouinis wrong in conjecturing that it was a name derived from the Greek<foreign lang="greek">o)/ros,</foreign> "a mountain," and designating the people as a mountain tribe.If Burnouf is right, the proper reading here would seem to be Arœi, orArrhœi.</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The length of the <hi rend="ital">schœnus</hi> has been mentioned by our author inC. 11 of the present Book. M. Saigey makes the Persian parasang to bevery nearly the same length as the schœnus of Pliny.</p><p><span id="note_17"><a href="#ref_17">17. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Commagene was a district in the north of Syria, bounded by theEuphrates on the east, by Cilicia on the west, and by Amanus on thenorth. Its capital was Samosata.</p><p><span id="note_18"><a href="#ref_18">18. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The place here spoken of by Pliny is probably the same mentionedby Ptolemy as in Cataonia, one of the provinces of Cappadocia. Accordingto Parisot, the site of the place is called at the present day'Ra Claudie.'</p><p><span id="note_19"><a href="#ref_19">19. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Salmasius has confounded these cataracts with those of Nachour, orElegia, previously mentioned. It is evident, however, that they are notthe same.</p><p><span id="note_20"><a href="#ref_20">20. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called Someisat. In literary history, it is celebrated as beingthe birth-place of the satirist Lucian. Nothing remains of it but a heapof ruins, on an artificial mound.</p></body>
