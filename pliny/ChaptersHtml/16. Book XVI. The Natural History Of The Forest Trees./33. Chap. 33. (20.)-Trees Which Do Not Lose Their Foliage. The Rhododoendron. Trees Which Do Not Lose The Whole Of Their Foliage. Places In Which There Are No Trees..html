<div2 type="chapter" n="33" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 33. (20.)—TREES WHICH DO NOT LOSE THEIR FOLIAGE.THE RHODODOENDRON. TREES WHICH DO NOT LOSE THE WHOLEOF THEIR FOLIAGE. PLACES IN WHICH THERE ARE NO TREES.</head><p>Belonging to this last class, there are the following treeswhich do not lose their leaves: the olive, the laurel, thepalm, the myrtle, the cypress, the pine, the ivy, the rhododendron,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and, although it may be rather called a herb than atree, the savin.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> The rhododendron, as its name indicates,comes from Greece. By some it is known as the nerium,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>and by others as the rhododaphne. It is an evergreen, bear-<pb n="3374" />ing a strong resemblance to the rose-tree, and throwing outnumerous branches from the stem; to beasts of burden, goats,and sheep it is poisonous, but for man it is an antidote<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> againstthe venom of serpents.</p><p>(21.) The following among the forest-trees do not lose theirhaves: the fir, the larch, the pinaster, the juniper, the cedar,the terebinth, the box, the holm-oak, the aquifolia, the cork,the yew, and the tamarisk.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> A middle place between theevergreens and those which are not so, is occupied by the an-drachle<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> in Greece, and by the arbutus<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> in all parts of theworld; as they lose all their leaves with the exception of thoseon the top of the tree. Among certain of the shrubs, too, thebramble and the calamus, the leaves do not fall. In the territoryof Thurii, where Sybaris formerly stood, from the city therewas a single oak<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> to be seen that never lost its leaves, andnever used to bud before midsummer: it is a singular thingthat this fact, which has been so often alluded to by the Greekwriters, should have been passed over in silence by our own.<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>Indeed, so remarkable are the virtues that we find belongingto some localities, that about Memphis in Egypt, and at Ele-phantina, in Thebais, the leaves<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> fall from none of the trees,not the vine even.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Nerion oleander of Linnæus; the laurel-rose, or rose of St. An.thony of the French; it has some distant resemblance to the olive-tree,but its leaf is that of the laurel, and its flower very similar to that ofthe rose.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxiv. c. 61.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Nerion" is the Greek name.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It has certain dangerous properties, which cause the herbivorous ani-mals to avoid touching it. It acts strongly on the muscular system, and,as Fée remarks, used as an antidote to the stings of serpents, it is not improbable that its effect would be the worst of the two.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xiii. c. 37. The tamarisk of the moderns is not an evergreen,which has caused writers to doubt if it is identical with the tamariscus ofthe ancients, and to be disposed to look for it among the larger ericæ orheaths. The leaves of the larch fall every year; those of the other evergreens mostly every two or three years.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xiii. c. 40.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xiii. c. 40. This assertion of Pliny is erroneous, as these treesare in reality evergreens, though all trees of that class are liable to lose theirleaves through certain maladies.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Quercus." The ilex or holm-oak is an evergreen.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny is in error here. Varro, De Re Rust. B. i. c. 7, has made mention of this tree.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The hot climates possess a greater number of evergreens than the temperate regions, but not of the same species or genus. The vine invariablyloses its leaves each year.</p></body>
