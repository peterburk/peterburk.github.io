Thecultivated kind is the sweetest of the two, but is far frompowerful; by some persons it is known as "panax." Crateuas, a Greek writer, gives this name, however, to the plantknown to us as "cunila bubula;"<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and others, again, callthe conyza<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> or cunilago, cunila, while they call cunila,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>properly so called, by the name of "thymbra." With uscunila has another appellation, being generally known as"satureia," and reckoned among the seasoning plants. It isusually sown in the month of February, and for utility rivalswild marjoram. These two plants are never used together,their properties being so extremely similar; but it is onlythe wild marjoram of Egypt that is considered superior tocunila.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Ligusticum levisticum of Linnæus.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Ox cunila."
