<div2 type="chapter" n="39" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 39. (30.)—THE LAUREL; THIRTEEN VARIETIES OF IT.</head><p>The laurel is especially consecrated to triumphs, is remarkablyornamental to houses, and guards the portals of our emperors<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>and our pontiffs: there suspended alone, it graces the palace, andis ever on guard before the threshold. Cato<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> speaks of twovarieties of this tree, the Delphic<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and the Cyprian. PompeiusLenæus has added another, to which he has given the name of"mustax," from the circumstance of its being used for puttingunder the cake known by the name of "mustaceum."<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> Hesays that this variety has a very large leaf, flaccid, and of awhitish hue; that the Delphic laurel is of one uniform colour,greener than the other, with berries of very large size, and ofa red tint approaching to green. He says, too, that it is withthis laurel that the victors at Delphi<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> are crowned, and warriorswho enjoy the honours of a triumph at Rome. The Cyprianlaurel, he says, has a short leaf, is of a blackish colour, withan imbricated<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> edge, and crisped.<pb n="3333" /></p><p>Since his time, however, the varieties have considerablyaugmented. There is the tinus<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> for instance, by some considered as a species of wild laurel, while others, again, regardit as a tree of a separate class; indeed, it does differ from thelaurel as to the colour, the berry being of an azure blue. Theroyal<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> laurel, too, has since been added, which has of latebegun to be known as the "Augustan:" both the tree, aswell as the leaf, are of remarkable size, and the berries havenot the usual rough taste. Some say, however, that the royallaurel and the Augustan are not the same tree, and make outthe former to be a peculiar kind, with a leaf both longer andbroader than that of the Augustan. The same authors, also,make a peculiar species of the bacalia the commonest laurelof all, and the one that bears the greatest number of berries.With them, too, the barren laurel<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> is the laurel of the triumphs, and they say that this is the one that is used by warriors when enjoying a triumph—a thing that surprises mevery much; unless, indeed, the use of it was first introducedby the late Emperor Augustus, and it is to be considered asthe progeny of that laurel, which, as we shall just now haveoccasion to mention, was sent to him from heaven; it being thesmallest of them all, with a crisped<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> short leaf; and very rarelyto be met with.</p><p>In ornamental gardening we also find the taxa<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> employed,with a small leaf sprouting from the middle of the leaf, andforming a fringe, as it were, hanging from it; the spadonia,<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>too, without this fringe, a tree that thrives remarkably wellin the shade: indeed, however dense the shade may be, it willsoon cover the spot with its shoots. There is the chamædaphne,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> also, a shrub that grows wild; the Alexandrian<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span><pb n="3334" />laurel, by some known as the Idean, by others as the "hypoglottion,"<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> by others as the "carpophyllon,"<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> and by others,again, as the "hypelates."<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> From the root it throws outbranches three quarters of a foot in length; it is much usedin ornamental gardening, and for making wreaths, and it hasa more pointed leaf than that of the myrtle, and superior to itin softness, whiteness, and size: the seed, which lies betweenthe leaves, is red. This last kind grows in great abundanceon Mount Ida and in the vicinity of Heraclea in Pontus: it isonly found, however, in mountainous districts.</p><p>The laurel, too, known as the daphnoides,<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> is a variety thathas received many different names: by some it is called thePelasgian laurel, by others the euthalon, and by others thestephanon Alexandri.<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> This is also a branchy shrub, with athicker and softer leaf than that of the ordinary laurel: iftasted, it leaves a burning sensation in the mouth and throat:the berries are red, inclining to black. The ancient writershave remarked, that in their time there was no species oflaurel in the island of Corsica. Since then, however, it has beenplanted there, and has thrived well.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We learn from two passages in Ovid that the laurel was suspendedover the gates of the emperors.
