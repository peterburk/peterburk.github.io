One of them having been captured by a king ofCaria and chained up in the harbour, great multitudes of dolphins assembled at the spot, and with signs of sorrow whichcould not be misunderstood, appealed to the sympathies ofthe people, until at last the king ordered it to be released.The young dolphins, also, are always attended<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> by a largerone, who acts as a guardian to them; and before now, they havebeen seen<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> carrying off the body of one which had died, thatit might not be devoured by the sea-monsters.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ælian also mentions this, Hist.
