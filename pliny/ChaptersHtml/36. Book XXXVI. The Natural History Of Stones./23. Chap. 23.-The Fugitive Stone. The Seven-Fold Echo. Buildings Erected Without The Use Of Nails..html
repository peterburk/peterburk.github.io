THE SEVEN-FOLD ECHO.BUILDINGS ERECTED WITHOUT THE USE OF NAILS.</head><p>In the same city also, there is a stone, known as the "Fugi-<pb n="6345" />tive Stone;"<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> the Argonaut¾, who used it for the purposes ofan anchor, having left it there. This stone having repeatedlytaken flight from the Prytan¾um,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> the place so called whereit is kept, it has been fastened down with lead. In thiscity also, near the gate which is known as the "Trachia,"<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>there are seven towers, which repeat a number of times allsounds that are uttered in them. This phenomenon, to whichthe name of "Echo," has been given by the Greeks, dependsupon the peculiar conformation of localities, and is producedin valleys more particularly. At Cyzicus, however, it is theeffect of accident only; while at Olympia, it is produced byartificial means, and in a very marvellous manner; in a porticothere, which is known as the "Heptaphonon,"<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> from the circumstancethat it returns the sound of the voice seven times.</p><p>At Cyzicus, also, is the Buleuterium,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> a vast edifice, constructedwithout a nail of iron; the raftering being so contrivedas to admit of the beams being removed and replacedwithout the use of stays. A similar thing, too, is the casewith the Sublician Bridge<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> at Rome; and this by enactment,on religious grounds, there having been such difficulty experiencedin breaking it down when Horatius Cocles<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> defended it.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Lapis Fugitivus."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A public place where the Prytanes or chief magistrates assembled,and where the public banquets were celebrated.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "Narrow" gate, apparently. Dion Cassius, B. 74, tells a similarstory nearly, of seven towers at Byzantium, near the <hi rend="ital">Thracian Gate;</hi> and"Thracia" is given by the Bamberg MS. It is most probable that the twoaccounts were derived from the same source.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot"><foreign lang="greek">)Epta/fwnon</foreign> "seven times vocal," Plutarch also mentions thisportico.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot"><foreign lang="greek">Bouleuth/rion</foreign> the "senate house" or "council-chamber."</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It was the most ancient of the bridges at Rome, and was so calledfrom its being built upon "sublices," or wooden beams. It was originallybuilt by Ancus Martius, and was afterwards rebuilt by the Pontifices orpontiffs. We learn from Ovid, Fasti, B. v. 1. 621, that it was still awooden bridge in the reign of Augustus. In the reign of Otho it wascarried away by an inundation. In later times it was also known as thePons ®milius, from the name of the person probably under whose superintendenceit was rebuilt.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B, xxxiv. c. 11.</p></body>
