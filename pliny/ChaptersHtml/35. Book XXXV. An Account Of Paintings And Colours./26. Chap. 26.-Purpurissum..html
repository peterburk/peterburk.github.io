For the purpose of preparingit, argentaria or silver chalk<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> is dyed along with purple<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>cloth, it imbibing the colour more speedily than the wool. Thebest of all is that which, being thrown the very first into theboiling cauldron, becomes saturated with the dye in its primitivestate. The next best in quality is that which has beenput into the same liquor, after the first has been removed.Each time that this is done, the quality becomes proportionallydeteriorated, owing, of course, to the comparative thinnessof the liquid. The reason that the purpurissum of Puteoliis more highly esteemed than that of Tyre, Gætulia, or Laconia,places which produce the most precious kinds of purple, is thefact that it combines more readily with hysginum,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and thatit is made to absorb the colouring liquid of madder. Theworst purpurissum is that of Lanuvium.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span></p><p>The price of purpurissum is from one to thirty denarii perpound. Persons who use it in painting, place a coat of sandyxbeneath; a layer on which of purpurissum with glair of egg,produces all the brilliant tints of minium. If, on the otherhand, it is their object to make a purple, they lay a coat ofcæruleum<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> beneath, and purpurissum, with egg,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> upon it.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In Chapter 12 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Plate powder.
