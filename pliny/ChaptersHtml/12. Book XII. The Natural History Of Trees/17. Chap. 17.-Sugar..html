This substance is a kind of honey, which collects<pb n="3115" />in reeds, white, like gum, and brittle to the teeth. Thelarger pieces are about the size of a filbert; it is only employed, however, in medicine.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Saccharon." Fée suggests that Pliny alludes to a peculiar kindof crystallized sugar, that is found in the bamboo cane, though, atthe same time, he thinks it not improbable that he may have heard ofthe genuine sugar-cane; as Strabo, B. xv., speaks of a honey found inIndia, prepared without the aid of bees, and Lucan has the line—"Quique bibunt tenerâ dulces ab arundine succos,"<lb />evidently referring to a sugar in the form of a syrup, and not of crystal,like that of the Bambos arundinacea. It is by no means improbable, thatPliny, or rather Dioscorides, from whom he copies, confuses the two kindsof sugar; as it is well known that the Saccharum officinarum, or sugarcane, has been cultivated from a very early period in Arabia Felix.</p></body>
