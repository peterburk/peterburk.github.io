<div2 type="chapter" n="12" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 12.—REMEDIES FOR QUINZY AND SCROFULA.</head><p>For quinzy we have very expeditious remedies in goose-gall,mixed with elaterium<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and honey, an owlet's brains, or theashes of a burnt swallow, taken in warm water; which lastremedy we owe<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> to the poet Ovid. But of all the remediesspoken of as furnished by the swallow, one of the most efficacious is that derived from the young of the wild swallow, abird which may be easily recognized by the peculiar conformation of its nest.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> By far the most effectual, however, of themall, are the young of the bank-swallow,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> that being the namegiven to the kind which builds its nest in holes on the banks ofrivers. Many persons recommend the young of any kind ofswallow as a food, assuring us that the person who takes itneed be in no apprehension of quinzy for the whole of theensuing year. The young of this bird are sometimes stifledand then burnt in a vessel with the blood, the ashes beingadministered to the patient with bread or in the drink: some,however, mix with them the ashes of a burnt weasel, in equalproportion. The same remedies are recommended also forscrofula, and they are administered for epilepsy, once a day, indrink. Swallows preserved in salt are taken for quinzy, in(loses of one drachma, in drink: the nest,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> too, of the bird,taken internally, is said to be a cure for the same disease.</p><p>Millepedes,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> it is thought, used in the form of a liniment, arepeculiarly efficacious for quinzy: some persons, also, administereleven of them, bruised in one semi-sextarius of hydromel,through a reed, they being of no use whatever if once touchedby the teeth. Other remedies mentioned are, the broth of a<pb n="5435" />mouse boiled with vervain, a thong of dogskin passed threetimes round the back, and pigeons' dung mixed with wine andoil. For the cure of rigidity of the muscles of the neck, andof opisthotony, a twig of vitex, taken from a kite's nest, isattached to the body as an amulet.</p><p>(5.) For ulcerated scrofula, a weasel's blood is employed, orthe animal itself, boiled in wine; but not in cases where thetumours have been opened with the knife. It is said, too,that a weasel, eaten with the food, is productive of a similareffect; sometimes, also, it is burnt upon twigs, and the ashesare applied with axle-grease. In some instances, a green lizardis attached to the body of the patient, a fresh one being substituted at the end of thirty days. Some persons preserve theheart of this animal in a small silver vessel,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> as a cure forscrofula in females. Old snails, those found adhering to shrubsmore particularly, are pounded with the shells on, and appliedas a liniment. Asps, too, are similarly employed, reduced toashes and mixed with bull suet; snakes' fat also, diluted withoil; and the ashes of a burnt snake, applied with oil or wax.It is a good plan also, in cases of scrofula, to eat the middleof a snake, the extremities being first removed, or to drinkthe ashes of the reptile, similarly prepared and burnt in anew earthen vessel: they will be found much more efficacious,however, when the snake has been killed between the rutsmade by wheels. It is recommended also, to dig up a cricketwith the earth about its hole, and to apply it in the form of aliniment; to use pigeons' dung, either by itself, or with barleymeal, or oatmeal and vinegar; or else to apply the ashes of aburnt mole, mixed with honey.</p><p>Some persons apply the liver of this last animal, crumbledin the hands, due care being taken not to wash it off for threedays: it is said, too, that a mole's right foot is a remedy forscrofula. Others, again, cut off the head of a mole, and afterkneading it with earth thrown up by those animals, divideit into tablets, and keep it in a pewter box, for the treatmentof all kinds of tumours, diseases of the neck, and the affectionsknown as "apostemes:" in all such cases the use of swine's<pb n="5436" />flesh is forbidden to the patient. "Taurus"<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> is the nameusually given to an earth-beetle, very similar to a tick inappearance, and which it derives from the diminutive hornswith which it is furnished: some persons call it the "earth-louse."<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> From the earth thrown up by these insects a liniment is prepared for scrofula and similar diseases, and for gout,the application not being washed off till the end of three days.This last remedy is effectual for a whole year, and all thoseother properties are attributed to it which we have mentioned<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>when speaking of crickets. There are some, again, who makea similar use of the earth thrown up by ants; while othersattach to the patient as many earth-worms as there are scrofu-lous tumours, the sores drying as the worms dry up.</p><p>Some persons cut off the head and tail of a viper, as alreadymentioned,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> about the rising of the Dog-star, which done, they</p><p>burn the middle, and give a pinch of the ashes in three fingers,for thrice seven days, in drink-such is the plan they use for</p><p>the cure of scrofula. Others, again, pass round the scrofuloustumours a linen thread, with which a viper has been suspendedby the neck till dead. Millepedes<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> are also used, with onefourth part of turpentine; a remedy which is equally recommended for the cure of all kinds of apostemes.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xx. c. 2.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">No very great obligation, apparently.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. x. c. 49.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Riparia."</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The only birds' nests that are <hi rend="ital">now</hi> taken internally are the <hi rend="ital">soutton</hi><hi rend="ital">bourong,</hi> or, edible birds' nests of the Chinese.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxix. c. 39.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Marcus Empiricus says that the heart must be enclosed in a silverlupine and worn suspended from the neck, being efficacious for scrofulaboth in males and females.

Dalechamps takes this to be the stag-beetle or bull-fly;but that, as Ajasson remarks, has four horns, two antenne, and two largemandibules; in addition to which, from its size, it would hardly be calledthe "earth-louse." He concludes that a lamellicorn is meant; but whetherbelonging to the Lucanidæ or the Scarabæidæ, it is impossible to say.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Pediculus terræ."</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. xxix. c. 33.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. xxix. c. 21.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He probably speaks of woodlice here. Ettmuller asserts their utilityin this form for scrofula. Valisnieri says the same; Spielmann prescribesthem for arthrosis; Riviere considers them as a detergent for ulcers, anda resolvent for tumours of the mamillæ; and Baglivi maintains that theyare a first-rate diuretic, and unequalled as a lithontriptic. They containmuriate of lime and of potash, which may possibly, in some small degree,give them an aperitive virtue.</p></body>
