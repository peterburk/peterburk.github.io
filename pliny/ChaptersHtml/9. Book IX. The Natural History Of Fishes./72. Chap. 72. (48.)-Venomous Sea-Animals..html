<div2 type="chapter" n="72" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 72. (48.)—VENOMOUS SEA-ANIMALS.</head><p>Nor yet are dire and venomous substances found wanting in thesea: such, for instance, as the sea-hare<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> of the Indian seas,<pb n="2460" />which is even poisonous by the very touch, and immediatelyproduces vomiting and disarrangement of the stomach. Inour seas it has the appearance of a shapeless mass, and onlyresembles the hare in colour; in India it resembles it in itslarger size, and in its hair, which is only somewhat coarser:there it is never taken alive. An equally deadly animal is thesea-spider,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> which is especially dangerous for a sting which ithas on the back: but there is nothing that is more to be dreadedthan the sting which protrudes from the tail of the trygon,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>by our people known as the pastinaca, a weapon five inches inlength. Fixing this in the root of a tree, the fish is able tokill it; it can pierce armour too, just as though with an arrow,and to the strength of iron it adds all the corrosive qualities ofpoison.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is mentioned again in B. xxiii. c. 3. Cuvier says, that the sea-hare of the ancients is the mollusc to which Linnæus has 'injudiciouslygiven the name of aplysia, which Pliny gives to certain of the spongegenus, and to which nomenclature of Linnæus the modern naturalists haveassented. (See N. 51, p. 456.) Its tentacles and its muzzle, he says, resemblethe muzzle and ears of the hare, closely enough to have caused this appellation.As its smell is disagreeable, and its figure repulsive, a multitude of marvellous, and indeed fatal qualities, he says, have been ascribed to this animal,which fishermen still speak of, but which, nevertheless, are not confirmed byactual experience. The only true fact that can be alleged against it is,that it secretes from an organ, situate in its body, a kind of acrid liquid.As to the Indian sea-hare, the body of which was covered with hair, Cuvierprofesses himself quite at a loss to know what it might be; but he thinksthat this name must have been given to some tetrodon, which may havereceived the name from the cleft in the jaw and the skin, bristling with fineand minute spines. The sailors, he says, attribute to the tetrodon certainvenomous properties.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier says, that there is reason to believe that this is the same asthe vive of the French (probably our weever), the Trachinus draco ofLinnæus. This creature, with the spiny projections of its first dorsal fin,is able to inflict wounds that are extremely difficult to cure; not becausethey are venomous in any degree, but because the extremities being veryminute, sharp, and pointed, penetrate deep into the flesh. See c. 43 ofthis Book.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or sting-ray, mentioned in c 40 and c. 67 of this Book; so calledfrom the Greek <foreign lang="greek">trugw\n.</foreign> Cuvier says, that this sting, or spine, is sharp,like a saw; and that when it has penetrated the flesh, it cannot be got outwithout enlarging the wound. This it is, and not its fancied poisonousqualities, that renders its wound so dangerous; and as for its action upontrees and iron, they are entirely fabulous.</p></body>
