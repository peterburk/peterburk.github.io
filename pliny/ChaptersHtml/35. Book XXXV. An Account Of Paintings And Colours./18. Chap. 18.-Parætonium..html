It is sea-foam,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> they say, solidified with slime, andhence it is that minute shells are often found in it. It is preparedalso in the Isle of Crete, and at Cyrenæ. At Rome, it isadulterated with Cimolian<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> earth, boiled and thickened. Theprice of that of the highest quality is fifty denarii per sixpounds. This is the most unctuous of all the white colours,and the most tenacious as a coating for plaster, the result ofits smoothness.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A white, much used for fresco painting.
