This light, which has all the appearance ofmoving within the stone, it transmits according to the angle ofinclination at which it is held; now in one direction, andnow in another. When held facing the sun, it emits whiterays like those of a star, and to this, in fact, it owes its name.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>The stones of India are very difficult to engrave, those of Carmania being preferred.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The vitreous Asteriated crystals of Sapphire are still called by thisname.
