Some of these are non-productive, the salamander, for instance, which is of no sex, either male or female; a distinction also, which does not exist in the eel andthe other kinds that are neither viviparous nor oviparous. Theoyster also, as well as the other shell-fish that adhere to thebottom of the sea or to rocks, are of neither sex. Again, as tothose animals which are able to engender of themselves, if theyare looked upon as divided into male and female, they do engender something, it is true, by coupling, but the produce is imperfect, quite dissimilar to the animal itself, and one from whichnothing else is reproduced; this we find to be the case withflies, when they give birth to maggots. This fact is better illustrated by the nature of those animals which are known as insects; a subject, indeed, very difficult of explanation, and onewhich requires to be treated of in a Book<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> by itself. We will,therefore, proceed for the present with our remarks upon theinstincts of the animals that have been previously mentioned.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See the following Book.</p></body>
