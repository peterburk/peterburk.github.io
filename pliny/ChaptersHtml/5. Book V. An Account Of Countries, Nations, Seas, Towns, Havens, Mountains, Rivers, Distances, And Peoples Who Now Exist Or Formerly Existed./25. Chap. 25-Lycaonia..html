It was assigned under the Persian empire to the satrapy of Cappadocia, but considered by the Greek and Roman geographers the south-east part of Phrygia.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Phrygia, or the western part of Asia, the first part of the Asiatic continent that received the name of Asia.

In the Acts of the Apostles it is described as a very populous city, inhabited by Greeks and Jews. Its site is now called Kunjah or Koniych.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It has been suggested that this may be the Tarbassus of Artemidorus, quoted by Strabo.
