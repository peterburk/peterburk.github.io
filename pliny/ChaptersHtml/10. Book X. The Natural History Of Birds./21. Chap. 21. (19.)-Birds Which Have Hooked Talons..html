(19.)ÑBIRDS WHICH HAVE HOOKED TALONS.</head><p>Many birds of this kind feed also on acorns and fruit, butonly those which are not carnivorous, with the exception ofthe kite; though when it feeds on anything but flesh, it is abird of ill omen.</p><p>The birds which have hooked talons are never gregarious;each one seeks its prey by itself. They nearly all of themsoar to a great height, with the exception of the birds of thenight, and more especially those of larger size. They all havelarge wings, and a small body; they walk with difficulty, andrarely settle upon stones, being prevented from doing so bythe curved shape of their talons.</p></div2></body>
