<div2 type="chapter" n="14" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 14.—AT WHAT PERIOD ALL THE STATUES ERECTED BYPRIVATE INDIVIDUALS WERE REMOVED FROM THE PUBLICPLACES.</head><p>We are informed by L. Piso, that when M. Æmilius and C.Popilius were consuls, for the second time,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> the censors, P.Cornelius Scipio and M. Popilius, caused all the statueserected round the Forum in honour of those who had bornethe office of magistrates, to be removed; with the exception ofthose which had been placed there, either by order of the<pb n="6161" />people or of the senate. The statue also which SpuriusCassius,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> who had aspired to the supreme authority, haderected in honour of himself, before the Temple of Tellus, wasmelted down by order of the censors; for even in this respect,the men of those days took precautions against ambition.</p><p>There are still extant some declamations by Cato, duringhis censorship, against the practice of erecting statues ofwomen in the Roman provinces. However, he could notprevent these statues being erected at Rome even; to Cornelia,for instance, the mother of the Gracchi, and daughter of theelder Scipio Africanus. She is represented in a sitting posture,and the statue is remarkable for having no straps to theshoes. This statue, which was formerly in the public Porticoof Metellus, is now in the Buildings of Octavia.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A.U.C. 596.—B.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See Chapter 9.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"In Octaviæ operibus."
