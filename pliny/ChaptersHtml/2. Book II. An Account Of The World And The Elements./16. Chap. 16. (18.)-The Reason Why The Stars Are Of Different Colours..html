(18.)-THE REASON WHY THE STARS ARE OF DIFFERENT COLOURS.</head><p>The difference of their colour depends on the difference intheir altitudes; for they acquire a resemblance to those planetsinto the vapour of which they are carried, the orbit of eachtinging those that approach it in each direction. A colderplanet renders one that approaches it paler, one more hot<pb n="1050" />renders it redder, a windy planet gives it a lowering aspect,while the sun, at the union of their apsides, or the extremityof their orbits, completely obscures them. Each of theplanets has its peculiar colour<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>; Saturn is white, Jupiterbrilliant, Mars fiery, Lucifer is glowing, Vesper refulgent,Mercury sparkling, the Moon mild; the Sun, when he rises,is blazing, afterwards he becomes radiating. The appearanceof the stars, which are fixed in the firmament, is also affectedby these causes. At one time we see a dense cluster of starsaround the moon, when she is only half-enlightened, andwhen they are viewed in a serene evening; while, at anothertime, when the moon is full, there are so few to be seen, thatwe wonder whither they are fled; and this is also the case whenthe rays of the sun, or of any of the above-mentioned bodies<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>,have dazzled our sight. And, indeed, the moon herself is,without doubt, differently affected at different times by therays of the sun; when she is entering them, the convexityof the heavens<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> rendering them more feeble than when theyfall upon her more directly<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>. Hence, when she is at a rightangle to the sun, she is half-enlightened; when in the trineaspect, she presents an imperfect orb<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>, while, in opposition,she is full. Again, when she is waning, she goes throughthe same gradations, and in the same order, as the three starsthat are superior to the sun<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ptolemy's account of the colours of the planets is nearly similar tothat of our author; "Candidus color Jovialis est, rutilus Martius,flavusVeneris, varius Mercurii;" De Jur.
