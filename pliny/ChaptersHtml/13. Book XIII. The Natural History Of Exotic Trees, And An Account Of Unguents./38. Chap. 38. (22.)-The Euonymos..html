(22.)ÑTHE EUONYMOS.</head><p>There is no tree productive of a more auspicious presagethan one which grows in the Isle of Lesbos, and is known bythe name of euonymos.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> It bears some resemblance to thepomegranate tree, the leaf being in size between the leaf ofthat and the leaf of the laurel, while in shape and softness itresembles that of the pomegranate tree: it has a white blossom,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> by which it immediately gives us notice of its dangerousproperties.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> It bears a pod<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> very similar to that of sesame,within which there is a grain of quadrangular shape, of coarsemake and poisonous to animals. The leaf, too, has the samenoxious effects; sometimes, however, a speedy alvine dischargeis found to give relief on such occasions.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or the "luckily named." It grew on Mount Ordymnus in Lesbos.See Theophrastus, B. ii. c. 31.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Evonymus Europ¾us, or else the Evonymus latifolius of botanists, is probably intended to be indicated; but it is a mistake to say thatit is poisonous to animals. On the contrary, FŽe says that sheep willfatten on its leaves very speedily.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Statim pestem denuntians." Pliny appears to be in error here.In copying from Theophrastus, he seems to have found the word <foreign lang="greek">fo/nos,</foreign>used, really in reference to a blood-red juice which distils from the plant;but as the same word also means slaughter, or death, he seems to havethought that it really bears reference to the noxious qualities of the plant.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">FŽe censures the use of the word "siliqua," as inappropriate, although the seed does resemble that of sesamum, the Sesamum orientaleof Linn¾us.</p></body>
