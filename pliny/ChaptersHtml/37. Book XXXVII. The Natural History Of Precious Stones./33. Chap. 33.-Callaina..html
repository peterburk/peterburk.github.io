<div2 type="chapter" n="33" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 33.—CALLAINA.</head><p>With this stone we must also couple another, which resemblesit more closely in appearance than in value, the stone knownas "callaina,"<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and of a pale green colour. It is found in thecountries<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> that lie at the back of India, among the Phycari,<pb n="6428" />namely, who inhabit Mount Caucasus, the Sacæ, and theDahæ. It is remarkable for its size, but is covered with holesand full of extraneous matter; that, however, which is foundin Carmania is of a finer quality, and far superior. In bothcases, however, it is only amid frozen and inaccessible rocks thatit is found, protruding from the surface, like an eye in appearance,and slightly adhering to the rock; not as though it formedan integral part of it, but with all the appearance of havingbeen attached to it. People so habituated as they are to ridingon horseback, cannot find the energy and dexterity requisitefor climbing the rocks to obtain the stones, while, at the sametime, they are quite terrified at the danger of doing so. Henceit is, that they attack the stones with slings from a distance,and so bring them down, moss and all. It is with this stonethat the people pay their tribute, and this the rich look uponas their most graceful ornament for the neck.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> This constitutesthe whole of their wealth, with some, and it is their chiefglory to recount how many of these stones they have broughtdown from the mountain heights since the days of their childhood.Their success, however, is extremely variable;<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> for whilesome, at the very first throw, have brought down remarkablyfine specimens, many have arrived at old age without obtainingany.</p><p>Such is the method of procuring these stones; their formbeing given them by cutting, a thing that is easily effected.The best of them have just the colour of smaragdus, a thingthat proves that the most pleasing property in them is one thatbelongs of right to another stone. Their beauty is heightenedby setting them in gold, and there is no stone to which thecontrast of the gold is more becoming. The finest of them losetheir colour by coming in contact with oil, unguents, or undilutedwine even; whereas those of a poorer quality preservetheir colour better. There is no stone, too, that is more easilycounterfeited in glass. Some writers say, that this stone is tobe found in Arabia also, in the nest of the bird known as the"melancoryphus."<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span><pb n="6429" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Dana thinks this identical with the Turquois.
