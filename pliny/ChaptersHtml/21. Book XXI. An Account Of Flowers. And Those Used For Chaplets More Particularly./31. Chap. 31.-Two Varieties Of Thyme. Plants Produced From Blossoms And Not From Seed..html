<div2 type="chapter" n="31" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 31.—TWO VARIETIES OF THYME. PLANTS PRODUCED FROM BLOSSOMS AND NOT FROM SEED.</head><p>There are also as many varieties of thyme<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> employed, theone white, the other dark:<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> it flowers about the summer solstice, when the bees cull from it. From this plant a sort ofaugury is derived, as to how the honey is likely to turn out:<pb n="4332" />for the bee-keepers have reason to look for a large crop whenthe thyme blossoms in considerable abundance. Thyme receives great injury from showers of rain, and is very apt toshed its blossom. The seed of thyme is so minute<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> as to beimperceptible, and yet that of origanum, which is also extremely minute, does not escape the sight. But what mattersit that Nature has thus concealed it from our view? For wehave reason to conclude that it exists in the flower itself;which, when sown in the ground, gives birth to the plant—what is there, in fact, that the industry of man has leftuntried?</p><p>The honey of Attica is generally looked upon as the best inall the world; for which reason it is that the thyme of thatcountry has been transplanted, being reproduced, as alreadystated, with the greatest difficulty, from the blossom. Butthere is also another peculiarity in the nature of the thyme ofAttica, which has greatly tended to frustrate these attempts—it will never live except in the vicinity of breezes from thesea. In former times, it was the general belief that this is thecase with all kinds of thyme, and that this is the reason whyit does not grow in Arcadia:<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> at a period when it was universally supposed, too, that the olive never grows beyond threehundred stadia<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> from the sea. But, at the present day, weknow for certain that in the province of Gallia Narbonensisthe Stony Plains<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> are quite overgrown with thyme; this being,in fact, the only source of revenue to those parts, thousandsof sheep<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> being brought thither from distant countries tobrowse upon the plant.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Under the head "Thymus," Fée thinks that both the Satureia capitata of Linnæus, headed savory, and the Thymus vulgaris, and Thymuszygis of Linnæus (varieties of thyme), should be included.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Fée thinks that in the expression "nigricans," he may allude to thedeep red of the stalk of some kinds of thyme, more particularly at the endof summer.
