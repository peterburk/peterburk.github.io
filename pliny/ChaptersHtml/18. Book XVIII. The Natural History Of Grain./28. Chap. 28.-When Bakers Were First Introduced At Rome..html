The ancient Romans used to make theirown bread, it being an occupation which belonged to the women, as we see the case in many nations even at the presentday. Plautus speaks of the artopta, or bread-tin, in hisComedy of the Alularia,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> though there has been considerablediscussion for that very reason among the learned, whether or<pb n="4041" />not that line really belongs to him. We have the fact, too,well ascertained, in the opinion of Ateius Capito, that thecooks in those days were in the habit of making the bread forpersons of affluence, while the name of "pistor"<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> was onlygiven to the person who pounded, or "pisebat," the spelt. Inthose times, they had no cooks in the number of their slavesbut used to hire them for the occasion from the market. TheGauls were the first to employ the bolter that is made ofhorse-hair; while the people of Spain make their sieves andmeal-dressers of flax,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and the Egyptians of papyrus andrushes.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Which ended A.U.C. 586.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A. ii. s. 9, 1. 4.
