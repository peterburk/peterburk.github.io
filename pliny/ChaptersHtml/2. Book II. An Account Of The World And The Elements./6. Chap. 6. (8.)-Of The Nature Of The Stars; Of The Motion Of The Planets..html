<div2 type="chapter" n="6" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 6. (8.)—OF THE NATURE OF THE STARS; OF THEMOTION OF THE PLANETS.</head><p>Let us return from this digression to the other partsof nature. The stars which are described as fixed in theheavens<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>, are not, as the vulgar suppose, attached each ofthem to different individuals<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>, the brighter to the rich, thosethat are less so to the poor, and the dim to the aged, shiningaccording to the lot of the individual, and separately assignedto mortals; for they have neither come into existence, nor<pb n="1026" />do they perish in connexion with particular persons, nordoes a falling star indicate that any one is dead. We arenot so closely connected with the heavens as that the shiningof the stars is affected by our death<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>. When they are supposed toshoot or fall<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, they throw out, by the force of theirfire, as if from an excess of nutriment, the superabundanceof the humour which they have absorbed, as we observe totake place from the oil in our lamps, when they are burning<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>.The nature of the celestial bodies is eternal, being interwoven, asit were, with the world, and, by this union, rendering it solid; butthey exert their most powerful influenceon the earth. This, notwithstanding its subtilty, may beknown by the clearness and the magnitude of the effect, aswe shall point out in the proper place<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>. The account of thecircles of the heavens will be better understood when wecome to speak of the earth, since they have all a reference toit; except what has been discovered respecting the Zodiac,which I shall now detail.</p><p>Anaximander the Milesian, in the 58th olympiad<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>, is saidto have been the first who understood its obliquity, and thusopened the road to a correct knowledge of the subject<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>.<pb n="1027" />Afterwards Cleostratus made the signs in it, first markingthose of Aries and Sagittarius; Atlas had formed the spherelong before this time<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>. But now, leaving the further consideration of this subject, we must treat of the bodies thatare situated between the earth and the heavens<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>.</p><p>It is certain that the star called Saturn is the highest, andtherefore appears the smallest, that he passes through thelargest circuit, and that he is at least thirty years in completingit<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>. The course of all the planets, and among othersof the Sun, and the Moon, is in the contrary direction tothat of the heavens<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>, that is towards the left, while the hea-<pb n="1028" />vens are rapidly carried about to the right<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>. And although,by the stars constantly revolving with immense velocity,they are raised up, and hurried on to the part where theyset, yet they are all forced, by a motion of their own, in anopposite direction<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>; and this is so ordered, lest the air, beingalways moved in the same direction, by the constant whirlingof the heavens, should accumulate into one mass, whereasnow it is divided and separated and beaten into small pieces,by the opposite motion of the different stars. Saturn is astar of a cold and rigid nature, while the orbit of Jupiter ismuch lower, and is carried round in twelve years<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>. The nextstar, Mars, which some persons call Hercules<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span>, is of a fieryand burning nature, and from its nearness to the sun is carriedround in little less than two years<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span>. In consequence ofthe excessive heat of this star and the rigidity of Saturn,Jupiter, which is interposed between the two, is temperedby both of them, and is thus rendered salutary. The pathof the Sun consists of 360 degrees; but, in order that theshadow may return to the same point of the dial<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span>, we areobliged to add, in each year, five days and the fourth part ofa day. On this account an intercalary day is given to everyfifth year<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span>, that the period of the seasons may agree withthat of the Sun.<pb n="1029" /></p><p>Below the Sun<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> revolves the great star called Venus, wanderingwith an alternate motion<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span>, and, even in its surnames,rivalling the Sun and the Moon. For when it precedes theday and rises in the morning, it receives the name of Lucifer,as if it were another sun, hastening on the day. On thecontrary, when it shines in the west, it is named Vesper, asprolonging the light, and performing the office of the moon.Pythagoras, the Samian, was the first who discovered itsnature<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span>, about the 62nd olympiad, in the 222nd year of theCity<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span>. It excels all the other stars in size, and its brilliancyis so considerable, that it is the only star which produces ashadow by its rays. There has, consequently, been greatinterest made for its name; some have called it the star of<pb n="1030" />Juno<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span>, others of Isis, and others of the Mother of the Gods.By its influence everything in the earth is generated. For,as it rises in either direction, it sprinkles everything withits genial dew, and not only matures the productions of theearth, but stimulates all living things<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span>. It completes thecircuit of the zodiac in 348 days, never receding from thesun more than 46 degrees, according to Timæus<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span>.</p><p>Similarly circumstanced, but by no means equal in sizeand in power, next to it, is the star Mercury, by some calledApollo<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span>; it is carried in a lower orbit, and moves in a coursewhich is quicker by nine days, shining sometimes before therising of the sun, and at other times after its setting, butnever going farther from it than 23 degrees<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span>, as we learnfrom Timæus and Sosigenes<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span>. The nature of these two starsis peculiar, and is not the same with those mentioned above,for those are seen to recede from the sun through one-thirdor one-fourth part of the heavens, and are often seen oppositeto it. They have also other larger circuits, in which they<pb n="1031" />make their complete revolutions, as will be described in theaccount of the great year<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span>.</p><p>(9.) But the Moon<span id="ref_31"><a href="#note_31">[31]</a></span>, which is the last of the stars, and theone the most connected with the earth, the remedy providedby nature for darkness, excels all the others in its admirablequalities. By the variety of appearances which it assumes, itpuzzles the observers, mortified that they should be the mostignorant concerning that star which is the nearest to them.She is always either waxing or waning; sometimes her discis curved into horns, sometimes it is divided into two equalportions, and at other times it is swelled out into a full orb;sometimes she appears spotted<span id="ref_32"><a href="#note_32">[32]</a></span> and suddenly becomes verybright; she appears very large with her full orb and suddenly becomes invisible; now continuing during all the night,now rising late, and now aiding the light of the sun duringa part of the day; becoming eclipsed and yet being visiblewhile she is eclipsed; concealing herself at the end of themonth and yet not supposed to be eclipsed<span id="ref_33"><a href="#note_33">[33]</a></span>. Sometimesshe is low down, sometimes she is high up, and that not according to one uniform course, being at one time raised up<pb n="1032" />to the heavens, at other times almost contiguous to themountains; now elevated in the north, now depressed in thesouth; all which circumstances having been noticed by Endymion, a report was spread about, that he was in love withthe moon<span id="ref_34"><a href="#note_34">[34]</a></span>. We are not indeed sufficiently grateful to those,who, with so much labour and care, have enlightened us withthis light<span id="ref_35"><a href="#note_35">[35]</a></span>; while, so diseased is the human mind, that wetake pleasure in writing the annals of blood and slaughter,in order that the crimes of men may be made known to thosewho are ignorant of the constitution of the world itself.</p><p>Being nearest to the axis<span id="ref_36"><a href="#note_36">[36]</a></span>, and therefore having the smallest orbit, the Moon passes in twenty-seven days and the one-third part of a day<span id="ref_37"><a href="#note_37">[37]</a></span>, through the same space for which Saturn,the highest of the planets, as was stated above, requires thirtyyears. After remaining for two days in conjunction with thesun, on the thirtieth day she again very slowly emerges to pursue her accustomed course<span id="ref_38"><a href="#note_38">[38]</a></span>. I know not whether she oughtnot to be considered as our instructress in everything that canbe known respecting the heavens; as that the year is dividedinto the twelve divisions of the months, since she follows thesun for the same number of times, until he returns to thecommencement of his course; and that her brightness, aswell as that of the other stars, is regulated by that of thesun, if indeed they all of them shine by light borrowed fromhim, such as we see floating about, when it is reflected fromthe surface of water. On this account it is that she dissolvesso much moisture, by a gentle and less perfect force, andadds to the quantity of that which the rays of the sun con-<pb n="1033" />sume<span id="ref_39"><a href="#note_39">[39]</a></span>. On this account she appears with an unequal light,because being full only when she is in opposition, on all theremaining days she shows only so much of herself to theearth as she receives light from the sun<span id="ref_40"><a href="#note_40">[40]</a></span>. She is not seenin conjunction, because, at that time, she sends back thewhole stream of light to the source whence she has derivedit. That the stars generally are nourished by the terrestrialmoisture is evident, because, when the moon is only half visible she is sometimes seen spotted, her power of absorbingmoisture not having been powerful enough; for the spotsare nothing else than the dregs of the earth drawn up alongwith the moisture<span id="ref_41"><a href="#note_41">[41]</a></span>. (10.) But her eclipses and those of thesun, the most wonderful of all the phænomena of nature, andwhich are like prodigies, serve to indicate the magnitude ofthese bodies and the shadow<span id="ref_42"><a href="#note_42">[42]</a></span> which they cast.<pb n="1034" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"affixa mundo."

Heappears not to have been aware, that certain astronomical phænomenaundergo a regular progression, but supposed that they remained, at thetime when he wrote, in the same state as in the age of Hipparchus orthe original observers. Columella, when treating on these subjects, describes the phænomena according to the ancient calculation, but he informsus, that he adopts it, because it was the one in popular use, and betterknown by the farmers (De Re Rust. ix. 14), while Pliny appears not tohave been aware of the inaccuracy.</p><p><span id="note_21"><a href="#ref_21">21. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Modo solem antegrediens, modo subsequens."

It was a vulgar notion among theancients, that when the moon is eclipsed, she is suffering from the influence of magicians and enchanters, who are endeavouring to draw herdown to the earth, in order to aid them in their superstitious ceremonies.It was conceived that she might be relieved from her sufferings by loudnoises of various kinds which should drown the songs of the magicians.Allusion is frequently made to this custom by the ancient poets, as Virgil,Æn. i. 742, Manilius, i. 227, and Juvenal, vi. 444; and the language hasbeen transferred to the moderns, as in Beattie's Minstrel, ii. 47, "Toease of fancied pangs the labouring moon."</p><p><span id="note_34"><a href="#ref_34">34. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We have some interesting remarks by Marcus respecting Endymion,and also on the share which Solon and Thales had in correcting the lunarobservations; Ajasson, ii. 288–290.</p><p><span id="note_35"><a href="#ref_35">35. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Lucem nobis aperuere in hac luce."</p><p><span id="note_36"><a href="#ref_36">36. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Cardo."</p><p><span id="note_37"><a href="#ref_37">37. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Astronomers describe two different revolutions or periods of themoon; the synodical and the sidereal. The synodical marks the timein which the moon passes from one conjunction with the sun to the nextconjunction, or other similar position with respect to the sun. The sidereal period is the time in which the moon returns to the same positionwith respect to the stars, or in which it makes a complete revolution roundthe earth.

Marcus, however, takes a differentview of thesubject; Ajasson, ii. 291, 292. He had previously pointed out Pliny'sopinion respecting the phases of the moon, as one of the circumstanceswhich indicate his ignorance of astronomy, <hi rend="ital">ut supra,</hi> ii. 245, 246.</p><p><span id="note_41"><a href="#ref_41">41. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This doctrine is maintained by Seneca, Quæst.

Although itmay be of little consequence in this particular sentence, yet, assuch liberties are not unfrequently taken, I think it necessary tostate my opinion,that this mode of proceeding is never to be admitted, and that it hasproved a source of serious injury to classical literature. In this accountof the astronomical phenomena, as well as in all the other scientificdissertations that occur in our author, my aim has been to transferinto ourlanguage the exact sense of the original, without addition or correction.Our object in reading Pliny is not to acquire a knowledge of natural philosophy, which might be better learned from the commonest elementarywork of the present day, but to ascertain what were the opinions of thelearned on such subjects when Pliny wrote. I make this remark, becauseI have seldom if ever perused a translation of any classical author, where,on scientific topics, the translator has not endeavoured, more or less, tocorrect the mistakes of the original, and to adapt his translation to thestate of modern science.</p></body>
