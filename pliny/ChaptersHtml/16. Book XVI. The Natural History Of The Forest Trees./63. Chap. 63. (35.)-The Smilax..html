(35.)ÑTHE SMILAX.</head><p>Very similar to the ivy is a plant which first came fromCilicia, but is now more commonly found in Greece, andknown by the name of smilax.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> It has numerous thick stalkscovered with joints, and thorny branches of a shrub-like form:the leaf resembles that of the ivy, but is not angular, whilefrom the foot-stalk it throws out tendrils; the flower is white,and has the smell of the lily. It bears clusters like those ofthe wild vine and not the ivy, and of a reddish colour. Thelarger berries contain three stones, the smaller but one only:these berries are black and hard. This plant is looked uponas ill-omened, and is consequently banished from all sacredrites, and is allowed to form no part of chaplets; having received this mournful character from the maiden Smilax, whoupon her love being slighted by the youth Crocus, was transformed into this shrub. The common people, being mostlyignorant of this, not unfrequently take it for ivy, and pollutetheir festivities with its presence; for who, in fact, is unaware<pb n="3403" />that the ivy is used as a chaplet by poets, as also by FatherLiber and Silenus? Tablets are made<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> of the wood of thesmilax, and it is a peculiarity of this wood to give out a slightsound,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> if held close to the ear. It is said that ivy is remarkably efficacious for testing wine, and that a vessel made of thiswood will let the wine pass through it, while the water willremain behind, if there has been any mixed with it.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Smilax aspera of Linn¾us; the sarsaparilla plant.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">FŽe is inclined to question this; but the breadth of the tablets mayhave been very small in this instance.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Of course this is fabulous: though it is not impossible that thewriting on the tablets may sometimes have caused " a noise in the world,"and that hence the poets may have given rise to this story.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny borrows this fabulous story from Cato, De Re Rust. c. 3.</p></body>
