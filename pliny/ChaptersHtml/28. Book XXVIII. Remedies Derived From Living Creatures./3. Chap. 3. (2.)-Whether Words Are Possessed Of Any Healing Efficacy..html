<div2 type="chapter" n="3" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 3. (2.)—WHETHER WORDS ARE POSSESSED OF ANYHEALING EFFICACY.</head><p>In reference to the remedies derived from man, there arisesfirst of all one question, of the greatest importance and alwaysattended with the same uncertainty, whether words, charms,and incantations, are of any efficacy or not?<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> For if suchis the case, it will be only proper to ascribe this efficacy toman himself;<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> though the wisest of our fellow-men, I shouldremark, taken individually, refuse to place the slightest faithin these opinions. And yet, in our every-day life, we practically show, each passing hour, that we do entertain this belief,<pb n="5279" />though at the moment we are not sensible of it. Thus, forinstance, it is a general belief that without a certain form ofprayer<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> it would be useless to immolate a victim, and that,with such an informality, the gods would be consulted to littlepurpose. And then besides, there are different forms ofaddress to the deities, one form for entreating,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> another form foraverting their ire, and another for commendation.</p><p>We see too, how that our supreme magistrates use certainformulæ for their prayers: that not a single word may beomitted or pronounced out of its place, it is the duty of oneperson to precede the dignitary by reading the formula beforehim from a written ritual, of another, to keep watch uponevery word, and of a third to see that<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> silence is not ominouslybroken; while a musician, in the meantime, is performing on theflute to prevent any other words being heard.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> Indeed, thereare memorable instances recorded in our Annals, of cases whereeither the sacrifice has been interrupted, and so blemished,by imprecations, or a mistake has been made in the utteranceof the prayer; the result being that the lobe of the liver orthe heart has disappeared in a moment, or has been doubled,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>while the victim stood before the altar. There is still in existence a most remarkable testimony,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> in the formula which theDecii, father and son, pronounced on the occasions when theydevoted themselves.<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> There is also preserved the prayeruttered by the Vestal Tuccia,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> when, upon being accused ofincest, she carried water in a sieve—an event which took placein the year of the City 609. Our own age even has seen aman and a woman buried alive in the Ox Market,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> Greeks bybirth, or else natives of some other<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> country with which we<pb n="5280" />were at war at the time. The prayer used upon the occasionof this ceremonial, and which is usually pronounced first bythe Master of the College of the Quindecimviri,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> if read by aperson, must assuredly force him to admit the potency offormulæ; when it is recollected that it has been proved tobe effectual by the experience of eight hundred and thirtyyears.</p><p>At the present day, too, it is a general belief, that our Vestalvirgins have the power, by uttering a certain prayer, to arrestthe flight of runaway slaves, and to rivet them to the spot,provided they have not gone beyond the precincts of theCity. If then these opinions be once received as truth, and if itbe admitted that the gods do listen to certain prayers, or areinfluenced by set forms of words, we are bound to concludein the affirmative upon the whole question. Our ancestors,no doubt, always entertained such a belief, and have evenassured us, a thing by far the most difficult of all, that it ispossible by such means to bring down lightning from heaven,as already<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> mentioned on a more appropriate occasion.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Whether or not, they cannot, as Ajasson remarks, be regarded asremedies <hi rend="ital">derived from</hi> the human body, being no part of the human body.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Homini acceptun fieri oportere conveniat."
