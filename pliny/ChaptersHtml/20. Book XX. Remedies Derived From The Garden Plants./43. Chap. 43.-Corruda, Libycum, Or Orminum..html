This vegetable has the effect of dispelling thejaundice, and a decoction of it, in doses of one hemina, isrecommended as an aphrodisiac; a similar effect is producedalso by a mixture of asparagus seed and dill in doses of three<pb n="4246" />oboli respectively. A decoction of asparagus juice is givenalso for the stings of serpents; and the root of it, mixed withthat of marathrum,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> is reckoned in the number of the mostvaluable remedies we are acquainted with.</p><p>In cases of h¾maturia, Chrysippus recommends a mixtureof asparagus, parsley, and cummin seed, to be given to thepatient every five days, in doses of three oboli, mixed withtwo cyathi of wine. He says, however, that though employedthis way, it is a good diuretic, it is bad for dropsy, andacts as an antaphrodisiac; and that it is injurious to thebladder, unless it is boiled first.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> He states also, that if thewater in which it is boiled is given to dogs, it will kill them;<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>and that the juice of the root boiled in wine, kept in the mouth,is an effectual cure for tooth-ache.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xix. c. 42: the Asparagus tenuifolius of Linn¾us, the wildasparagus, or Corruda of the South of France.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">FŽe says that in the South of Europe there is a kind, known to botanists as white asparagus, with a prickly stem: he suggests that it maypossibly be the same as that here spoken of.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or fennel. FŽe says that, till very recently, the roots of asparagusand of fennel were combined in medicine, forming part of the five "majoraperitive" roots.

Parsley, though possessed of marked properties,is but little employed in medicine. What Pliny here states respecting it,FŽe says, is a tissue of fables: but it is still used for the cure of sores, andeven as an ophthalmic.</p></body>
