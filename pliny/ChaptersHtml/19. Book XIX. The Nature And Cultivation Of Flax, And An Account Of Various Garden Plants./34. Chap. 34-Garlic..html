<div2 type="chapter" n="34" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 34—GARLIC.</head><p>Garlic<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> is generally supposed, in the country more particularly, to be a good specific<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> for numerous maladies. The ex-<pb n="4175" />ternal coat consists of membranes of remarkable fineness, whichare universally discarded when the vegetable is used; the innerpart being formed by the union of several cloves, each of whichhas also a separate coat of its own. The flavour of it is pungent, and the more numerous the cloves the more pungent itis. Like the onion, it imparts an offensive smell to the breath;but this is not the case when it is cooked. The various speciesof garlic are distinguished by the periods at which they ripen:the early kind becomes fit for use in sixty days. Another distinction, too, is formed by the relative size of the heads. Ulpicum<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>, also, generally known to the Greeks as "Cyprian garlic,"belongs to this class; by some persons it is called "antiscorodon," and in Africa more particularly it holds a high rankamong the dishes of the rural population; it is of a larger sizethan ordinary garlic. When beaten up with oil and vinegar,it is quite surprising what a quantity of creaming foam is produced.</p><p>There are some persons who recommend that neither ulpicumnor garlic should be sown on level ground, but say that theyshould be planted in little mounds trenched up, at a distance ofthree feet apart. Between each clove, they say, there shouldbe a distance of four fingers left, and as soon as ever threeleaves are visible, the heads should be hoed; the oftener theyare hoed, the larger the size they will attain. When theybegin to ripen, the stalks are bent downwards, and coveredover with earth, a precaution which effectually prevents themfrom running to leaf. In cold soils, it is considered better toplant them in spring than in autumn.</p><p>For the purpose of depriving all these plants of their strongsmell, it is recommended to set them when the moon is belowthe horizon, and to take them up when she is in conjunction.Independently of these precautions, we find Menander, oneof the Greek writers, recommending those who have beeneating garlic to eat immediately afterwards a root of beet<pb n="4176" />roasted on hot coals; if this is done, he says, the strong smellof the garlic will be effectually neutralized. Some persons are ofopinion, that the proper period for planting garlic and ulpicumis between the festival of the Compitalia<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and that of theSaturnalia<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>. Garlic, too, can be grown from seed, but it isvery slow, in such case, in coming to maturity; for in the firstyear, the head attains the size only of that of a leek, in thesecond, it separates into cloves, and only in the third it arrivesat maturity; there are some, however, who think that garlicgrown this way is the best. Garlic should never be allowedto run to seed, but the stalk should be twisted, to promote itsgrowth, and to make the head attain a larger size.</p><p>If garlic or onions are wanted to keep some time, the headsshould be dipped in salt water, made luke-warm; by doingthis, they will be all the better for keeping, though quiteworthless for reproduction. Some persons content themselveswith hanging them over burning coals, and are of opinion thatthis is quite sufficient to prevent them from sprouting: for itis a well-known fact, that both garlic and onions sprout whenout of the ground, and that after throwing out their thin shootsthey shrivel away to nothing. Some persons are of opinion,too, that the best way of keeping garlic is by storing it in chaff.There is a kind<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> of garlic that grows spontaneously in thefields, and is known by the name of "alum." To preservethe seeds that are sown there from the remorseless ravages ofthe birds, this plant is scattered over the ground, being firstboiled, to prevent it from shooting. As soon as ever they haveeaten of it, the birds become so stupefied as to be taken withthe hand even<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>, and if they remain but a few moments onlyon the spot, they fall fast asleep. There is a wild garlic,too, generally known as "bear's" garlic<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>; it has exactly thesmell of millet, with a very small head and large leaves.<pb n="4177" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Allium sativum of Linnæus. It was much eaten by the Romansoldiers and sailors, and by the field labourers. It is in reference to thisvegetable, "more noxious than hemlock," that Horace exclaims—<lb />"O dura messorum ilia!"</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It was thought to have the property of neutralizing the venom ofserpents; and though persons who had just eaten of it were not allowed toenter the Temple of the Mother of the Gods, it was prescribed to thosewho wished to be purified and absolved from crimes. It is still held inconsiderable esteem in the south of Europe, where, by the lower classes,great medicinal virtues are ascribed to it.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Theophrastus says, Hist.

Instead, however,of having the comparatively mild smell of millet, its odour is powerful; somuch so, as to impart a strong flavour to the milk of the cows that eat ofit. It is very common, Fée says, in nearly every part of France.</p></body>
