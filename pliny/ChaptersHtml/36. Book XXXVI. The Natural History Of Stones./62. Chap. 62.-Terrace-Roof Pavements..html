In making thesepavements, the proper plan is to begin with two layers of boards,running different ways, and nailed at the extremities, to preventthem from warping. Upon this planking a rough-work mustbe laid, one-fourth of which consists of pounded pottery: andupon this, another bed of rough-work, two-fifths composed oflime, a foot in thickness, and well beaten down with therammer. The nucleus<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> is then laid down, a bed six fingersin depth; and upon that, large square stones, not less than a<pb n="6378" />couple of fingers in thickness; an inclination being carefullyobserved, of an inch and a half to every ten feet. This done,the surface is well rubbed down with a polishing stone. Thegeneral opinion is, that oak<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> should never be used for theplanking, it being so very liable to warp; and it is considereda good plan to cover the boards with a layer of fern or chaff,that they may be the better able to resist the action of thelime. It is necessary, too, before putting down the planking,to underset it with a bed of round pebbles. Wheat-ear<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> tesselated pavements are laid down in a similar manner.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Subdialia;" more literally, "open-air pavements."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "kernel;" so called because it lay in the middle. Vitruvius saysthat it was composed of one part lime, and three parts pounded pottery.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Quercus."</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Spicata testacea." These pavements were probably so called becausethe bricks were laid at angles to each other (of about forty-fivedegrees), like the grains in an ear of wheat; or like the spines projectingfrom either side of the back-bone of a fish.</p></body>
