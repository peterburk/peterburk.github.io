<div2 type="chapter" n="58" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 58. (57.)—THE THINGS ABOUT WHICH MANKIND FIRST OF ALL AGREED. THE ANCIENT LETTERS.</head><p>There was at the very earliest<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> period a tacit consent amongall nations to adopt the letters now used by the Ionians.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>(58.) That the ancient Greek letters were almost the samewith the modern Latin,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> is proved by the ancient Delphicinscription on copper, which is now in the Palatine library,having been dedicated by the emperors to Minerva; this inscription is as follows:</p><p><foreign lang="greek">NAUSIKRATHS ANEQETO THI DIOS KORHI.</foreign>["Nausicrates offered this to the daughter of Zeus."]<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Herodotus, B. v. c. 59, says that the Phœnician letters were verysimilar to the Ionian; and we are informed by Hardouin, that Scaliger, inhis Dissertation upon an ancient inscription on a column discovered in theVia Appia, and removed to the Farnese Gardens, has proved that theIonians borrowed their letters from the Phœnicians.—B.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Herodotus confirms this opinion by a reference to an ancient tripod atThebes, written in what he terms Cadmæn letters, having a strong resemblance to those used by the Ionians.—B.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Tacitus, Ann. B. ix. c. 14, says, "The Latin letters have the sameform as the most ancient Greek ones."—B.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There is scarcely a letter of this inscription which has not been controverted, and no two editions hardly agree.—B.</p></body>
