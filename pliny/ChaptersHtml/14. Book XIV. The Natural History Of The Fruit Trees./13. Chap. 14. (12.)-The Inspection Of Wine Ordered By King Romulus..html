<div2 type="chapter" n="14" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 14. (12.)—THE INSPECTION OF WINE ORDERED BY KING ROMULUS.</head><p>Romulus made libations, not with wine but with milk; afact which is fully established by the religious rites whichowe their foundation to him, and are observed even to thepresent day. The Posthumian Law, promulgated by KingNuma, has an injunction to the following effect:—" Sprinklenot the funeral pyre with wine;" a law to which he gave hissanction, no doubt, in consequence of the remarkable scarcityof that commodity in those days. By the same law, he alsopronounced it illegal to make a libation to the gods of wine thatwas the produce of an unpruned vine, his object being to compelthe husbandmen to prune their vines; a duty which theyshowed themselves reluctant to perform, in consequence of thedanger which attended climbing the trees.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> M. Varro informs us, that Mezentius, the king of Etruria, succoured theRutuli against the Latini, upon condition that he should receive all the wine that was then in the territory of Latium.</p><p>(13.) At Rome it was not lawful for women to drink wine.Among the various anecdotes connected with this subject, wefind that the wife of Egnatius Mecenius<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> was slain by her husband with a stick, because she had drunk some wine from the vat,and that he was absolved from the murder by Romulus. FabiusPictor, in his Book of Annals, has stated that a certain lady,for having opened a purse in which the keys of the wine-cellarwere kept, was starved to death by her family: and Cato tellsus, that it was the usage for the male relatives to give thefemales a kiss, in order to ascertain whether they smelt of"temetum;" for it was by that name that wine was thenknown, whence our word "temulentia," signifying drunkenness. Cn. Domitius, the judge, once gave it as his opinion,that a certain woman appeared to him to have drunk morewine than was requisite for her health, and without the knowledge of her husband, for which reason he condemned her tolose her dower. For a very long time there was the greatest<pb n="3253" />economy manifested at Rome in the use of this article. L. Papirius,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> the general, who, on one occasion, commanded againstthe Samnites, when about to engage, vowed an offering to Jupiterof a small cupfull of wine, if he should gain the victory. In fact,among the gifts presented to the gods, we find mention madeof offerings of sextarii of milk, but never of wine.</p><p>The same Cato, while on his voyage to Spain, from whichhe afterwards returned triumphant,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> would drink of no otherwine but that which was served out to the rowers—very different, indeed, to the conduct of those who are in the habit ofgiving to their guests even inferior wine<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> to that which theydrink themselves, or else contrive to substitute inferior in thecourse of the repast.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Circa pericula arbusti."
