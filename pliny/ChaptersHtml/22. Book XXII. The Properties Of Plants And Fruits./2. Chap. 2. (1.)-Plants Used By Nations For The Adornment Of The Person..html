<div2 type="chapter" n="2" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 2. (1.)ÑPLANTS USED BY NATIONS FOR THE ADORNMENT OF THE PERSON.</head><p>I remark, in the first place, that there are some foreign nations which, in obedience to long-established usage, employcertain plants for the embellishment of the person. That,among some barbarous peoples, the females<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> stain the face bymeans of various plants, there can be little doubt, and amongthe Daci and the Sarmat¾ we find the men even marking<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> theirbodies. There is a plant in Gaul, similar to the plantago inappearance, and known there by the name of "glastum:"<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span><pb n="4390" />with it both matrons and girls<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> among the people of Britainare in tile habit of staining the body all over, when takingpart in the performance of certain sacred rites; rivallinghereby tile swarthy hue of the ®thiopianls, they go in a stateof nature.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">FŽe remarks, that at the present day, in all savage nations in whichtatooing is practised, the men display more taste and care in the operationthan is shewn by the females. There is little doubt that it is the art oftatooing the body, or in other words, first puncturing it and then rubbingin various colours, that is here spoken of by Pliny.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Inscribunt." "Writing upon," or "tatooing," evidently.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Our "word," the Isatis tinctoria of Linn¾us, which imparts a blue colour. The root of this Celtic wood is probably "glas," "blue," whencealso our word "glass;" and it is not improbable that the name of glasswas given to it from the blue tints which it presented. Julius C¾sar andPomponius Mela translate this word "glastum," by the Latin "vitrum""glass."</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Conjuges nurusque." C¾sar says that <hi rend="ital">all</hi> the people in Britain werein the habit of staining the body with woad, to add to the horror of theirappearance in battle. Pomponius Mela expresses himself as uncertain forwhat purpose it was done, whether it was to add to their beauty, or forsome other reasons to him unknown.</p></body>
