<div2 type="chapter" n="44" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 44. (30.)—THE HYÆNA.</head><p>It is the vulgar notion, that the hyæna possesses in itselfboth sexes, being a male during one year, and a female thenext, and that it becomes pregnant without the co-operationof the male; Aristotle, however, denies this.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> The neck, withthe mane, runs continuously into the back—Bone, so that theanimal cannot bend this part without turning round the wholebody. Many other wonderful things are also related of this animal; and strangest of all, that it imitates the human voice amongthe stalls of the shepherds; and while there, learns the name ofsome one of them, and then calls him away, and devours him.It is said also, that it can imitate a man vomiting, and that,in this way, it attracts the dogs, and then falls upon them.It is the only animal that digs up graves, in order to obtainthe bodies of the dead. The female is rarely caught: itseyes, it is said, are of a thousand various colours and changesof shade. It is said also, that on coming in contact with itsshadow, dogs will lose their voice, and that, by certain magical influences, it can render any animal immoveable, roundwhich it has walked three times.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle, De Gener. Anim. B. iii. c. 6, and Hist. Anim. B. vi c. 32,accounts for the vulgar error, by stating that the hyæna has a peculiarstructure of the parts about the anus, which might, to an unpractised eye,give the idea, that it possesses the generative organs of both sexes. Ælian,Anim. Nat. B. i. c. 25, and Oppian, Cyneget. B. iii. c. 289, have adoptedthis erroneous opinion. What is said respecting the hyena, in the remaining part of this Chapter, is mostly without foundation.—B.</p></body>
