(39.)ÑWHETHER THE BLOOD IS THE PRINCIPLE OFLIFE.</head><p>There are some persons who are of opinion that the finenessof the wit does not depend upon the thinness of the blood, butthat animals are more or less stupid in proportion to the skinor other coverings of the body, as the oyster and the tortoise,for instance: that the hide of the ox and the bristles of the hog,in fact, offer a resistance to the fine and penetrating powers ofthe air, and leave no passage for its transmission in a pureand liquid state. The same, they say, is the case, too, withmen, when the skin is very thick or callous, and so excludesthe air. Just as if, indeed, the crocodile was not equally remarkable for the hardness of its skin and its extreme cunning.</p></div2></body>
