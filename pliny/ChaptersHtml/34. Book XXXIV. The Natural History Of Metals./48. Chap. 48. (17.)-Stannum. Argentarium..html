<div2 type="chapter" n="48" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 48. (17.)ÑSTANNUM. ARGENTARIUM.</head><p>When copper vessels are coated with stannum,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> they producea less disagreeable flavour, and the formation of verdigrisis prevented; it is also remarkable, that the weight of thevessel is not increased. As already mentioned,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> the finestmirrors were formerly prepared from it at Brundisium, untileverybody, our maid-servants even, began to use silver ones.At the present day a counterfeit stannum is made, by addingone-third of white copper to two-thirds of white lead.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> Itis also counterfeited in another way, by mixing together equalparts of white lead and black lead; this last being what iscalled "argentarium."<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> There is also a composition called"tertiarium," a mixture of two parts of black lead and one ofwhite: its price is twenty denarii per pound, and it is usedfor soldering pipes. Persons still more dishonest mix together<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>equal parts of tertiarium and white lead, and, calling the compound"argentarium," coat articles with it melted. This lastsells at sixty denarii per ten pounds, the price of the pure unmixedwhite lead being eighty denarii, and of the black seven.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span></p><p>White lead is naturally more dry; while the black, on thecontrary, is always moist; consequently the white, withoutbeing mixed with another metal, is of no use<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> for anything.Silver too, cannot be soldered with it, because the silver becomesfused before the white lead. It is confidently stated,also, that if too small a proportion of black lead is mixed with<pb n="6215" />the white, this last will corrode the silver. It was in theGallic provinces that the method was discovered of coatingarticles of copper with white lead, so as to be scarcely distinguishablefrom silver: articles thus plated are known as"incoctilia."<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> At a later period, the people of the town ofAlesia<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> began to use a similar process for plating articles withsilver, more particularly ornaments for horses, beasts of burden,and yokes of oxen: the merit, however, of this inventionbelongs to the Bituriges.<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> After this, they began to ornamenttheir esseda, colisata, and petorita<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> in a similar manner; andluxury has at last arrived at such a pitch, that not only aretheir decorations made of silver, but of gold even, and whatwas formerly a marvel to behold on a cup, is now subjected tothe wear and tear of a carriage, and this in obedience towhat they call fashion!</p><p>White lead is tested, by pouring it, melted,<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> upon paper,which ought to have the appearance of being torn rather bythe weight than by the heat of the metal. India has neithercopper nor lead,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> but she procures them in exchange for herprecious stones and pearls.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A compound metal, probably, somewhat like pewter.

Beckmannsuggests that the tinning ought to have been done with <hi rend="ital">pure tin,</hi> butthat unprincipled artists employed tin mixed with lead. It is mostprobable, however, that Pliny himself has made a mistake, and that weshould read "equal parts of black lead" (our lead); in which case themixture passed off as "argentarium," instead of containing <hi rend="ital">equal</hi> parts oftin and lead, would contain <hi rend="ital">five-sixths</hi> of lead.
