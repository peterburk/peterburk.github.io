(17.)—MASTICH.</head><p>The transition, therefore,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> is very easy to mastich, whichgrows upon another prickly shrub of India and Arabia, knownby the name of laina. Of mastich as well there are two different kinds; for in Asia and Greece there is also found a herbwhich puts forth leaves from the root, and bears a thistlyhead, resembling an apple, and full of seeds. Upon an incision being made in the upper part of this plant drops distilfrom it, which can hardly be distinguished from the genuinemastich. There is, again, a third sort,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> found in Pontus, butmore like bitumen than anything else. The most esteemed,however, of all these, is the white mastich of Chios, the priceof which is twenty denarii per pound, while the black mastichsells at twelve. It is said that the mastich of Chios exudesfrom the lentisk in the form of a sort of gum: like frankincense, it is adulterated with resin.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is most probably the meaning of Pliny's expression—"Ergotransit in mastichen;" though Hardouin reads it as meaning that myrrhsometimes degenerates to mastich: and Fée, understanding the passage inthe same sense, remarks that the statement is purely fabulous. Mastich,he says, is the produce of the Pistacia lentiscus of Linnæus, which aboundsin Greece and the other parts of southern Europe. The greater part ofthe mastich of commerce comes from the island of Chio. It is impossibleto conjecture to what plant Pliny here alludes, with the head of a thistle.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This kind, Fée says, is quite unknown to the moderns.</p></body>
