For a similar purpose also, acuckoo is attached to the body in a hare's skin, or a youngheron's bill to the forehead in an ass's skin: it is thought, too,that the beak alone, steeped in wine, is equally efficacious. Onthe other hand, a bat's head, dried and worn as an amulet, actsas a preventive of sleep.</p></div2></body>
