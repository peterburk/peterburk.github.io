(4.)ÑROMAN PAINTERS.</head><p>Among the Romans, too, this art very soon rose into esteem,for it was from it that the Fabii, a most illustrious family, derivedtheir surname of "Pictor;" indeed the first of the familywho bore it, himself painted the Temple of Salus,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> in the yearof the City, 450; a work which lasted to our own times, but wasdestroyed when the temple was burnt, in the reign of Claudius.Next in celebrity were the paintings of the poet Pacuvius, inthe Temple of Hercules, situate in the Cattle Market:<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> he wasa son of the sister of Ennius, and the fame of the art wasenhanced at Rome by the success of the artist on the stage.After this period, the art was no longer practised by men ofrank; unless, indeed, we would make reference to Turpilius,in our own times, a native of Venetia, and of equestrian rank,several of whose beautiful works are still in existence atVerona. He painted, too, with his left hand, a thing neverknown to have been done by any one before.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span></p><p>Titidius Labeo, a person of pr¾torian rank, who had beenformerly proconsul of the province of Gallia Narbonensis, andwho lately died at a very advanced age, used to pride himselfupon the little pictures which he executed, but it only causedhim to be ridiculed and sneered at. I must not omit, too, tomention a celebrated consultation upon the subject of painting,which was held by some persons of the highest rank.<pb n="6231" /></p><p>Q. Pedius,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> who had been honoured with the consulship and atriumph, and who had been named by the Dictator C¾sar asco-heir with Augustus, had a grandson, who being dumb fromhis birth, the orator Messala, to whose family his grandmotherbelonged, recommended that he should be brought up as apainter, a proposal which was also approved of by the lateEmperor Augustus. He died, however, in his youth, afterhaving made great progress in the art. But the high estimationin which painting came to be held at Rome, was principallydue, in my opinion, to M. Valerius Maximus Messala,who, in the year of the City, 490, was the first to exhibit apainting to the public; a picture, namely, of the battle inwhich he had defeated the Carthaginians and Hiero in Sicily,upon one side of the Curia Hostilia.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> The same thing was done,too, by L. Scipio,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> who placed in the Capitol a painting of thevictory which he had gained in Asia; but his brother Africanus,it is said, was offended at it, and not without reason, for hisson had been taken prisoner in the battle.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> Lucius HostiliusMancinus,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> too, who had been the first to enter Carthage at thefinal attack, gave a very similar offence to ®milianus,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> byexposing in the Forum a painting of that city and the attackupon it, he himself standing near the picture, and describingto the spectators the various details of the siege; a piece ofcomplaisance which secured him the consulship at the ensuingComitia.</p><p>The stage, too, which was erected for the games celebratedby Claudius Pulcher,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> brought the art of painting into greatadmiration, it being observed that the ravens were so deceivedby the resemblance, as to light upon the decorationswhich were painted in imitation of tiles.<pb n="6232" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "Health."
