When it lightens from the north-eastonly, it portends rain on the following day; but when fromthe north, wind may be expected from that quarter. When itlightens on a clear night from the south, the west, or thenorth-west, there will be wind and rain from those quarters.Thunder<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> in the morning is indicative of wind, and at middayof rain.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This, Fée remarks, appears to be consistent with generalexperience.</p></body>
