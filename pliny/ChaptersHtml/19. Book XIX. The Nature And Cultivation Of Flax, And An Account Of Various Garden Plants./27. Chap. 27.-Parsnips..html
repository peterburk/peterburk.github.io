<div2 type="chapter" n="27" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 27.—PARSNIPS.</head><p>The other kinds which have been classified by us among thecartilaginous plants, are of a more ligneous nature; and it isa singular thing, that they have, all of them, a strong flavour.Among these, there is one kind of wild parsnip which grows<pb n="4166" />spontaneously; by the Greeks it is known as "staphylinos."<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>Another kind<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> of parsnip is grown either from the root transplanted, or else from seed, at the beginning of spring or in theautumn; Hyginus says that this may be done in February,August, September, and October, the ground being dug to avery considerable depth for the purpose. The parsnip beginsto be fit for eating at the end of a year, but it is still better atthe end of two: it is reckoned more agreeable eating in autumn,and more particularly if cooked in the saacepan; even then,however, it preserves its strong pungent flavour, which it isfound quite impossible to get rid of.</p><p>The hibiscum<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> differs from the parsnip in being more slender:it is rejected as a food, but is found useful for its medicinalproperties. There is a fourth kind,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> also, which bears a similardegree of resemblance to the parsnip; by our people it iscalled the "gallica," while the Greeks, who have distinguishedfour varieties of it, give it the name of "daucus." We shallhave further occasion<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> to mention it among the medicinalplants.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There is some doubt as to the identity of this plant, but Fée, afterexamining the question, comes to the conclusion that it is the DaucusCarota, or else Mauritanicus of Linnæus, the common carrot, or that ofMauritania. Sprengel takes it to be either this last or the Daucus guttatus,a plant commonly found in Greece.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Pastinaca sativa of Linnæus, or common parsnip.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The marsh-mallow, probably, the Althæa officinalis of Linnæus.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The carrot.
