<div2 type="chapter" n="8" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 8. (6.)—FIFTY KINDS OF GENEROUS WINES.</head><p>Who can entertain a doubt that some kinds of wine aremore agreeable to the palate than others, or that even outof the very same vat<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> there are occasionally produced winesthat are by no means of equal goodness, the one being muchsuperior to the other, whether it is that it is owing to thecask,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> or to some other fortuitous circumstance? Let eachperson, therefore, constitute himself his own judge as to whichkind it is that occupies the pre-eminence. Livia<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> Augusta,who lived to her eighty-second year,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> attributed her longevityto the wine of Pucinum,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> as she never drank any other. Thiswine is grown near a bay of the Adriatic, not far from MountTimavus, upon a piece of elevated rocky ground, where thesea-breeze ripens a few grapes, the produce of which suppliesa few amphoræ: there is not a wine that is deemed superiorto this for medicinal purposes. I am strongly of opinion thatthis is the same wine, the produce of the Adriatic Gulf, uponwhich the Greeks have bestowed such wonderful encomiums,under the name of Prætetianum.</p><p>The late Emperor Augustus preferred the Setinum to allothers, and nearly all the emperors that have succeeded himhave followed his example, having learnt from actual experience that there is no danger of indigestion and flatulenceresulting from the use of this liquor: this wine is grown inthe country<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> that lies just above Forum Appii.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> In formertimes the Cæcubum enjoyed the reputation of being the most<pb n="3240" />generous of all the wines; it was grown in some marshyswamps, planted with poplars, in the vicinity<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> of the Gulf ofAmyclæ. This vineyard has, however, now disappeared, theresult of the carelessness of the cultivator, combined with itsown limited extent, and the works on the canal which Nerocommenced, in order to provide a navigation from Lake Avernus to Ostia.</p><p>The second rank belonged to the wine of the Falernian territory, of which the Faustianum was the most choice variety;the result of the care and skill employed upon its cultivation.This, however, has also degenerated very considerably, in consequence of the growers being more solicitous about quantity<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>than quality. The Falernian<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> vineyards begin at the bridge ofCampania, on the left-hand as you journey towards the UrbanaColonia of Sylla, which was lately a township of the city ofCapua. As to the Faustian vineyards, they extend about fourmiles from a village near Cædicix,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> the same village being sixmiles from Sinuessa. There is now no wine known that rankshigher than the Falernian; it is the only one, too, among allthe wines that takes fire on the application of flame.<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> Thereare three varieties of it—the rough, the sweet, and the thin.Some persons make the following distinctions: the Caucinum,they say, grows on the summit of this range of hills, the Faustianum on the middle slopes, and the Falernum at the foot:the fact, too, should not be omitted, that none of the grapesthat produce these more famous wines have by any means anagreeable flavour.</p><p>To the third<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> rank belonged the various wines of Alba, in thevicinity of the City, remarkable for their sweetness, and some-<pb n="3241" />times, though rarely, rough<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> as well: the Surrentine<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> wines,also, the growth of only stayed vines, which are especiallyrecommended to invalids for their thinness and their wholesomeness. Tiberius Cæsar used to say that the physicians hadconspired thus to dignify the Surrentinum, which was, in fact,only another name for generous vinegar; while Caius Cæsar,who succeeded him, gave it the name of "noble vappa."<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span>Vying in reputation with these are the Massic wines, from thespots which look from Mount Gaurus towards Puteoli andBaiæ.<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> As to the wines of Stata, in the vicinity of Falernum,there is no doubt that they formerly held the very highestrank, a fact which proves very clearly that every district hasits own peculiar epochs, just as all other things have their riseand their decadence. The Calenian<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> wines, too, from the sameneighbourhood, used to be preferred to those last mentioned,as also the Fundanian,<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> the produce of vines grown on stays,or else attached to shrubs. The wines, too, of Veliternum<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span>and Priverna,<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> which were grown in the vicinity of the City,used to be highly esteemed. As to that produced at Signia,<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span>it is by far too rough to be used as a wine, but is very usefulas an astringent, and is consequently reckoned among themedicines for that purpose.</p><p>The fourth rank, at the public banquets, was given by thelate Emperor Julius-he was the first, in fact, that brought<pb n="3242" />them into favour, as we find stated in his Letters<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span>—to theMamertine wines, the produce of the country in the vicinityof Messana,<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span> in Sicily. The finest of these was the Potulanum,<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span> so called from its original cultivator, and grown onthe spots that lie nearest to the mainland of Italy. The Tauromenitanum also, a wine of Sicily, enjoys a high repute, andfiaggons<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span> of it are occasionally passed off for Mamertinum.</p><p>Among the other wines, we find mentioned upon the UpperSea those of Prætutia and Ancona, as also those known asthe "Palmensia,"<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span> not improbably because the cluster springsfrom a single shoot.<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span> In the interior we find the wines ofCæsena<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span> and that known as the Mæcenatian,<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span> while in theterritory of Verona there are the Rhætian wines, only inferior,in the estimation of Virgil, to the Falernian.<span id="ref_31"><a href="#note_31">[31]</a></span> Then, too, atthe bottom of the Gulf<span id="ref_32"><a href="#note_32">[32]</a></span> we find the wines of Adria.<span id="ref_33"><a href="#note_33">[33]</a></span> Onthe shores of the Lower Sea there are the Latiniensian<span id="ref_34"><a href="#note_34">[34]</a></span>wines, the Graviscan,<span id="ref_35"><a href="#note_35">[35]</a></span> and the Statonian:<span id="ref_36"><a href="#note_36">[36]</a></span> in Etruria, thewines of Luna bear away the palm, and those of Genua<span id="ref_37"><a href="#note_37">[37]</a></span> inLiguria. Massilia, which lies between the Pyrenees and theAlps, produces two varieties of wine, one of which is richerand thicker than the other, and is used for seasoning otherwines, being generally known as "succosum."<span id="ref_38"><a href="#note_38">[38]</a></span> The repu-<pb n="3243" />tation of the wine of Beterræ<span id="ref_39"><a href="#note_39">[39]</a></span> does not extend beyond theGallic territories;<span id="ref_40"><a href="#note_40">[40]</a></span> and as for the others that are produced inGallia Narbonensis, nothing can be positively stated, for thegrowers of that country have absolutely established manufactories for the purposes of adulteration, where they give a darkhue to their wines by the agency of smoke; I only wish Icould say, too, that they do not employ various herbs andnoxious drugs for the same purpose;<span id="ref_41"><a href="#note_41">[41]</a></span> indeed, these dealers areeven known to use aloes for the purpose of heightening theflavour and improving the colour of their wines.</p><p>The regions of Italy that are at a greater distance from theAusonian Sea, are not without their wines of note, such asthose of Tarentum,<span id="ref_42"><a href="#note_42">[42]</a></span> Servitia,<span id="ref_43"><a href="#note_43">[43]</a></span> and Consentia,<span id="ref_44"><a href="#note_44">[44]</a></span> and those, again,of Tempsa, Babia, and Lucania, among which the wines ofThurii hold the pre-eminence. But the most celebrated of allof them, owing to the fact that Messala<span id="ref_45"><a href="#note_45">[45]</a></span> used to drink it, andwas indebted to it for his excellent health, was the wineof Lagara,<span id="ref_46"><a href="#note_46">[46]</a></span> which was grown not far from Grumentum.<span id="ref_47"><a href="#note_47">[47]</a></span> InCampania, more recently, new growths under new names havegained considerable credit, either owing to careful cultivation,or else to some other fortuitous circumstances: thus, for instance, we find four miles from Neapolis the Trebellian,<span id="ref_48"><a href="#note_48">[48]</a></span> near<pb n="3244" />Capua the Cauline,<span id="ref_49"><a href="#note_49">[49]</a></span> wine, and the wine of Trebula<span id="ref_50"><a href="#note_50">[50]</a></span> grown inthe territory so called, though but of a common sort: Campaniaboasts of all these, as well as of her Trifoline<span id="ref_51"><a href="#note_51">[51]</a></span> wines. As tothe wines of Pompeii,<span id="ref_52"><a href="#note_52">[52]</a></span> they have arrived at their full perfectionin ten years, after which they gain nothing by age: they arefound also to be productive of headache, which often lastsso long as the sixth hour<span id="ref_53"><a href="#note_53">[53]</a></span> of the next day.</p><p>These illustrations, if I am not greatly mistaken, will go farto prove that it is the land and the soil that is of primaryimportance, and not the grape, and that it is quite superfluousto attempt to enumerate all the varieties of every kind, seeingthat the same vine, transplanted to several places, is productiveof features and characteristics of quite opposite natures. Thevineyards of Laletanum<span id="ref_54"><a href="#note_54">[54]</a></span> in Spain<span id="ref_55"><a href="#note_55">[55]</a></span> are remarkable for theabundance of wine they produce, while those of Tarraco<span id="ref_56"><a href="#note_56">[56]</a></span> andof Lauron<span id="ref_57"><a href="#note_57">[57]</a></span> are esteemed for the choice qualities of theirwines: those, too, of the Balearic Isles<span id="ref_58"><a href="#note_58">[58]</a></span> are often put in comparison with the very choicest growths of Italy.</p><p>I am by no means unaware that most of my readers will beof opinion that I have omitted a vast number of wines, seeingthat every one has his own peculiar choice; so much so, thatwherever we go, we hear the same story told, to the effectthat one of the freedmen of the late Emperor Augustus, whowas remarkable for his judgment and his refined taste in wines,while employed in tasting for his master's table, made thisobservation to the master of the house where the emperorwas staying, in reference to some wine the growth of thatparticular country: "The taste of this wine," said he, "is<pb n="3245" />new to me, and it is by no means of first-rate quality; theemperor, however, you will see, will drink of no other."<span id="ref_59"><a href="#note_59">[59]</a></span>Indeed I have no wish to deny that there may be other winesdeserving of a very high reputation, but those which I havealready enumerated are the varieties upon the excellence ofwhich the world is at present agreed.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Lacus.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The testa or amphora, made of earth.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">As the wife of Augustus is meant, this reading appears preferable to"Julia."</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Dion Cassius says "eighty-sixth."</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. iii. c. 22, and B. xvii. c. 3.
