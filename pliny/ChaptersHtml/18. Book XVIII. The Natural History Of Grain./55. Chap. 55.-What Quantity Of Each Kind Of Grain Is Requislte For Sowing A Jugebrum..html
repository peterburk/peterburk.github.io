Where the soil is rich, the proportionmust be greater, where it is thin, less.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span></p><p>There is another distinction, too, to be made; where thesoil is dense, cretaceous, or moist, there should be six modii ofwheat or winter-wheat to the jugerum, but where the land isloose, dry, and prolific, four will be enough. A meagre soil,too, if the crop is not very thinly sown, will produce a diminutive,empty ear. Rich lands give a number of stalks to eachgrain, and yield a thick crop from only a light sowing. Theresult, then, is, that from four to six modii must be sown,according to the nature of the soil; though there are somewho make it a rule that five modii is the proper proportion forsowing, neither more nor less, whether it is a densely-plantedlocality, a declivity, or a thin, meagre soil. To this subjectbears reference an oracular precept which never can be toocarefully observed<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>—"Don't rob the harvest."<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>Attius, in hisPraxidicus,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> has added that the proper time for sowing is,<pb n="4072" />when the moon is in Aries, Gemini, Leo, Libra, and Aquarius.Zoroaster says it should be done when the sun has passed twelvedegrees of Scorpio, and the moon is in Taurus.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This Chapter is mostly from Columella, B. ii. c. 9.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In c. 19 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably the mixture called "farrago" in c. 10 and c. 41.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Upon this point the modern agriculturists are by no means agreed.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From Cato, De Re Rust. c. 5.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Segetem ne defrudes."
