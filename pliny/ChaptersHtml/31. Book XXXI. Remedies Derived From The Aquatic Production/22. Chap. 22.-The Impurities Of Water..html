<div2 type="chapter" n="22" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 22.—THE IMPURITIES OF WATER.</head><p>Slime<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> is one great impurity of water: still, however, if ariver of this description is full of eels, it is generally lookedupon as a proof<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> of the salubrity of its water; just as it isregarded as a sign of its freshness when long worms<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> breed inthe water of a spring. But it is bitter water, more particu-larly, that is held in disesteem, as also the water which swellsthe stomach the moment it is drunk, a property which belongs<pb n="5485" />to the water at Trœzen. As to the nitrous<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and salso-acid<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>waters which are found in the deserts, persons travelling acrosstowards the Red Sea render them potable in a couple of hoursby the addition of polenta, which they use also as food.Those springs are more particularly condemned which secretemud,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> or which give a bad complexion to persons who drinkthereof. It is a good plan, too, to observe if water leavesstains upon copper vessels; if leguminous vegetables boil withdifficulty in it; if, when gently decanted, it leaves an earthydeposit; or if, when boiled, it covers the vessel with a thickcrust.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span></p><p>It is a fault also in water<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>but to have any flavour<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> not only to have a bad smell,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> at all, even though it be a flavourpleasant and agreeable in itself, or closely approaching, as weoften find the case, the taste of milk. Water, to be trulywholesome, ought to resemble air<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> as much as possible. Thereis only one<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> spring of water in the whole universe, it is said,that has an agreeable smell, that of Chabura, namely, in Mesopotamia: the people give a fabulous reason for it, and saythat it is because Juno<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> bathed there. Speaking in generalterms, water, to be wholesome, should have neither taste norsmell.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "mud"—"limus."
