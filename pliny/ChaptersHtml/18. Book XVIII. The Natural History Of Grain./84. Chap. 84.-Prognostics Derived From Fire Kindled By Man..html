So, too, if the snuffhangs down, and sparks gather upon it, or if the burning coalsadhere<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> to vessels taken from off the fire, or if the fire, whencovered up, sends out hot embers or emits sparks, or if the cindersgather into a mass upon the hearth, or the coals burnbright and glowing.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Terreni ignes.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This, and the other phænomena here mentioned, result, as Fée says,from the hygrometric state of the air.
