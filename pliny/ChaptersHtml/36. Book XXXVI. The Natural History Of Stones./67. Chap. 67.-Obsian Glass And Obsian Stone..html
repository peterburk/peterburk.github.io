<div2 type="chapter" n="67" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 67.—OBSIAN GLASS AND OBSIAN STONE.</head><p>Among the various kinds of glass, we may also reckonObsian glass, a substance very similar to the stone<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> whichObsius discovered in Æthiopia. This stone is of a very darkcolour, and sometimes transparent; but it is dull to the sight,and reflects, when attached as a mirror to walls, the shadowof the object rather than the image. Many persons use it<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span><pb n="6382" />for jewellery, and I myself have seen solid statues<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> in thismaterial of the late Emperor Augustus, of very considerablethickness. That prince consecrated, in the Temple of Concord,as something marvellous, four figures of elephants madeof Obsian stone. Tiberius Cæsar, too, restored to the peopleof Heliopolis, as an object of ceremonial worship, an image inthis stone, which had been found among the property left byone of the præfects of Egypt. It was a figure of Menelaüs; acircumstance which goes far towards proving that the use ofthis material is of more ancient date than is generally supposed,confounded as it is at the present day with glass, byreason of its resemblance. Xenocrates says that Obsian stoneis found in India also, and in Samnium in Italy; and that itis a natural product of Spain, upon the coasts which borderon the Ocean.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span></p><p>There is an artificial Obsian stone, made of coloured glassfor services for the table; and there is also a glass that is redall through, and opaque, known as "hæmatinum."<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> A deadwhite glass, too, is made, as also other kinds in imitation of murrhine<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>colour, hyacinthine, sapphire, and every other tint:indeed, there is no material of a more pliable<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> nature thanthis, or better suited for colouring. Still, however, thehighest value is set upon glass that is entirely colourless andtransparent, as nearly as possible resembling crystal, in fact.For drinking-vessels, glass has quite superseded the use ofsilver and gold; but it is unable to stand heat unless acold liquid is poured in first. And yet, we find that globularglass vessels, filled with water, when brought in contact withthe rays of the sun,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> become heated to such a degree as tocause articles of clothing to ignite. When broken, too, glassadmits of being joined by the agency of heat; but it cannot<pb n="6383" />be wholly fused without being pulverized into small fragments,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>as we see done in the process of making the smallchecquers, known as "abaculi," for mosaic work; some ofwhich are of variegated colours, and of different shapes. Ifglass is fused with sulphur, it will become as hard as stone.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Voleanic glass, feldspar in a more or less pure state, our Obsidian, isprobably meant; a word derived from the old reading, Obaidius, correctedby Sillig to <hi rend="ital">Obsius.</hi></p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He is speaking of the stone, not the glass that resembled it.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A thing very difficult to be done, as Beckmann observes, by reasonof its brittleness.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The present Portugal.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Blood-red" glass.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxxvii. cc. 7, 8, 11.
