Sesame<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> comes from India, where theyextract an oil from it; the colour of its grain is white.Similar in appearance to this is the erysimum of Asia andGreece, and indeed it would be identical with it were it notthat the grain is better filled.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> It is the same grain that isknown among us as "irio;" and strictly speaking, ought ratherto be classed among the medicaments than the cereals. Of thesame nature, too, is the plant called "horminum"<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> by theGreeks, though resembling cummin<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> in appearance; it is sownat the same time as sesame: no animal will eat either this oririo while green.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In c. 10 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See c. 10.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pinguius.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Already mentioned in c. 10.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">B. xix. c. 17; and B. xx. c. 57.</p></body>
