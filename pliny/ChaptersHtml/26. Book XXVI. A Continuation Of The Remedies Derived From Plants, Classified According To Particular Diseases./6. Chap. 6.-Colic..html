It was only in the reign of TiberiusC¾sar that this malady made its appearance in Italy, theemperor himself being the first to be attacked by it; a circumstance which produced considerable mystification throughout the City, when it read the edict issued by that princeexcusing his inattention to public business, on the ground of hisbeing laid up with a disease, the very name of which was tillthen unknown. To what cause are we to attribute these variousdiseases, or how is it that we have thus incurred the anger ofthe gods? Was it deemed too little for man to be exposed to<pb n="5156" />fixed and determinate classes of maladies, already more thanthree hundred in number, that he must have new forms ofdisease to alarm him as well? And then, in addition to allthese, not less in number are the troubles and misfortunes whichman brings upon himself!</p><p>The remedies which I am here describing, are those whichwere universally employed in ancient times, Nature herself,so to say, making up the medicines: indeed, for a long timethese were the only medicines employed.</p><p>(2.) Hippocrates,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> it is well known, was the first to compile a code of medical precepts, a thing which he did with thegreatest perspicuity, as his treatises, we find, are replete withinformation upon the various plants. No less is the information which we gain from the works of Diocles<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> of Carystus,second only in reputation, as well as date, to Hippocrates.The same, too, with reference to the works of Praxagoras,Chrysippus, and, at a later period, Erasistratus<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> of Cos.Herophilus<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> too, though himself the founder of a more refinedsystem of medicine, was extremely profuse of his commendations of the use of simples. At a later period, however, experience, our most efficient instructor in all things, medicine inparticular, gradually began to be lost sight of in mere wordsand verbiage: it being found, in fact, much more agreeableto sit in schools, and to listen to the talk of a professor, thanto go a simpling in the deserts, and to be searching for thisplant or that at all the various seasons of the year.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Colum."
