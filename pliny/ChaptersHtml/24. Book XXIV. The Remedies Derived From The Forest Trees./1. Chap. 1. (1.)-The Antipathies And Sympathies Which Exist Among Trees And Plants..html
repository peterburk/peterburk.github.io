<div2 type="chapter" n="1" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 1. (1.)—THE ANTIPATHIES AND SYMPATHIES WHICH EXISTAMONG TREES AND PLANTS.</head><p>NOT even are the forests and the spots in which the aspect ofNature is most rugged, destitute of their peculiar remedies;for so universally has that divine parent of all things distributedher succours for the benefit of man, as to implant for hintmedicinal virtues in the trees of the desert even, while atevery step she presents us with most wonderful illustrations ofthose antipathies and sympathies which exist in the vegetableworld.</p><p>Between the quercus<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and the olive<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> there exists a hatredso inveterate, that transplanted, either of them, to a site previously occupied by the other, they will die.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> The quercustoo, if planted near the walnut, will perish. There is a mortalfeud<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> existing also between the cabbage and the vine; and thecabbage itself, so shunned as it is by the vine, will wither immediately if planted in the vicinity of cyclamen<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> or of origanum.We find it asserted even, that aged trees fit to be felled, arecut with all the greater difficulty, and dry all the more rapidly,<pb n="5002" />if touched by the hand of man before the axe is applied: itis a common belief, too, that when their load consists of fruit,beasts of burden are immediately sensible<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> of it, and will instantly begin to sweat, however trifling it may be, unless thefruit is duly shown to them before starting. Fennel-giant, asa fodder, is extremely grateful to the ass, and yet to other beastsof burden it is a deadly poison: hence it is that the ass is consecrated to Father Liber,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> to which deity the fennel is alsosacred.</p><p>Inanimate objects again, even of the most insignificantcharacter, have their own peculiar antipathies. Cooks disengage meat of the brine, when it has been too highly salted,by the agency of fine meal and the inner bark<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> of the lindentree. Salt again, tends to neutralize the sickly flavour of foodwhen over-sweet. The taste of water, when nitrous or bitter,is modified by the addition of polenta,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> so much so indeed, asto be rendered potable<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> in a couple of hours: it is for a similarreason, too, that a layer of polenta is put<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> in our linen winestrainers. A similar property is possessed also by the chalk<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>of Rhodes, and the argilla of our own country.</p><p>Equal affinities exist as well; pitch, for instance, is extractedby the agency of oil, both of them being of an unctuous natureoil again, will incorporate only with lime, both of them havinga natural antipathy<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> to water. Gum is most<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> easily removedwith vinegar, and ink<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> with water; in addition to which, there<pb n="5003" />are numberless other instances of sympathy and antipathywhich we shall be careful to mention in their appropriate places.</p><p>It is in tendencies of this description that the medical artfirst took its rise; though it was originally intended, no doubt,by Nature, that our only medicaments should be those whichuniversally exist, are everywhere to be found, and are to heprocured at no great outlay, the various substances, in fact, fromwhich we derive our sustenance. But at a later period thefraudulent disposition of mankind, combined with an ingenuityprompted by lucre, invented those various laboratories,<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> inwhich each one of us is promised an extension of his life—thatis, if he will pay for it. Compositions and mixtures of an in-explicable nature forthwith have their praises sung, and theproductions of Arabia and India are held in unbounded ad-miration in the very midst<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> of us. For some triflingsore or other, a medicament is prescribed from the shoresof the Red Sea; while not a day passes but what the realremedies are to be found upon the tables of the very poorestman among us.<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> But if the remedies for diseases werederived from our own gardens, if the plants or shrubs wereemployed which grow there, there would be no art, forsooth,that would rank lower than that of medicine.</p><p>Yes, avow it we must-the Roman people, in extending itsempire, has lost sight of its ancient manners, and in that wehave conquered we are the conquered:<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> for now we obey thenatives of foreign<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> lands, who by the agency of a single art haveeven out-generalled our generals.<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> More, however, on thistopic hereafter.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xvi. cc. 6, 8, 33, 50.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xvii. c. 3.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">As Fée justly remarks, the greater part of these so-called sympathiesand antipathies must be looked upon as so many fables. In the majority ofinstances, it is the habitual requirements of the tree or plant that constitute the difference; thus, for instance, the oak or quercus requires adifferent site and temperature from that needed by the olive, and the stonysoil adopted by the vine is but ill-suited for the cultivation of the cabbage.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xx. c. 36.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxi, cc. 27, 38, and B. xxv. c. 67.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See the same statement made in B. xxiii. c. 62.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or Bacchus.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Philvra." Fée does not think that it can be of any use for such apurpose. Hardouin says, however, that in his time meat when too highlysalted was wrapped in leaves of the lime or linden, for the purpose of ex-tracting the salt.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xviii. c. 14</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Instead of having this effect, Fée says, it would render it much worse.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The intention being to clear the wine, though in reality, as Fée observes, it would have a tendency to turn the wine into vinegar.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Chalk, or in other words, sub-carbonate of lime, and argilla, oraluminous earth combining several earthy salts, would probably neutralizethe acetic acid in the wine, but would greatly deteriorate its flavour.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">On the contrary, lime would appear to have a great affinity for water.absorbing it with avidity, if we may use the term.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">More easily with water; though vinegar will do for the purpose.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Atramentum." Br this passage, Fée says, it is clearly proved thatthe ink of the ancients was soluble in water, and that it contained neithergalls nor salts of iron. What it really was made of is still a matter ofdoubt; but it is not improbable that the basis of it was spodium, or ashesof ivory.</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Officinas.</p><p><span id="note_17"><a href="#ref_17">17. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"In medio." The reading is very doubtful here.</p><p><span id="note_18"><a href="#ref_18">18. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This, of course, is mere exaggeration.</p><p><span id="note_19"><a href="#ref_19">19. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He would seem to imply that the medical men of his age had conspiredto gain an adventitious importance by imposing upon the credulity of thepublic, on the principle "Omne ignotum pro magnifico;" much as the"medicine-men" of the North American Indians do at the present day.</p><p><span id="note_20"><a href="#ref_20">20. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He alludes to the physicians of Greece more particularly.</p><p><span id="note_21"><a href="#ref_21">21. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Imperatoribus quoque imperaverunt."</p></body>
