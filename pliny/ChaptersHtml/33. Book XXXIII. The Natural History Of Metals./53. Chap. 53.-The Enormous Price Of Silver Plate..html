C. Gracchuspossessed some silver dolphins, for which he paid five thousandsesterces per pound. Lucius Crassus, the orator, paidfor two goblets chased by the hand of the artist Mentor,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> onehundred thousand sesterces: but he confessed that for veryshame he never dared use them, as also that he had otherarticles of plate in his possession, for which he had paid atthe rate of six thousand sesterces per pound. It was the conquestof Asia<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> that first introduced luxury into Italy; for we<pb n="6136" />find that Lucius Scipio, in his triumphal procession, exhibitedone thousand four hundred pounds' weight of chased silver,with golden vessels, the weight of which amounted to onethousand five hundred pounds. This<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> took place in the yearfrom the foundation of the City, 565. But that which inflicteda still more severe blow upon the Roman morals, wasthe legacy of Asia,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> which King Attalus<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> left to the state athis decease, a legacy which was even more disadvantageousthan the victory of Scipio,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> in its results. For, upon thisoccasion, all scruple was entirely removed, by the eagernesswhich existed at Rome, for making purchases at the auctionof the king's effects. This took place in the year of the City,622, the people having learned, during the fifty-seven yearsthat had intervened, not only to admire, but to covet even,the opulence of foreign nations. The tastes of the Romanpeople had received, too, an immense impulse from the conquestof Achaia,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> which, during this interval, in the year ofthe City, 608, that nothing might be wanting, had introducedboth statues and pictures. The same epoch, too, that saw thebirth of luxury, witnessed the downfall of Carthage; so that,by a fatal coincidence, the Roman people, at the same moment,both acquired a taste for vice and obtained a licensefor gratifying it.</p><p>Some, too, of the ancients sought to recommend themselvesby this love of excess; for Caius Marius, after his victory overthe Cimbri, drank from a cantharus,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> it is said, in imitationof Father Liber;<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> Marius, that ploughman<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> of Arpinum, ageneral who had risen from the ranks.!<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">His age and country are uncertain.
