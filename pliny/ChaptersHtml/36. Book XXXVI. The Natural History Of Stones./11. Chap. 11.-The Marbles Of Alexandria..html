<div2 type="chapter" n="11" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 11.ÑTHE MARBLES OF ALEXANDRIA.</head><p>The marbles are too well known to make it necessary forme to enumerate their several colours and varieties; and,indeed, so numerous are they, that it would be no easy task todo so. For what place is there, in fact, that has not a marbleof its own? In addition to which, in our description of theearth and its various peoples,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> we have already made it ourcare to mention the more celebrated kinds of marble. Still,however, they are not all of them produced from quarries, butin many instances lie scattered just beneath the surface of theearth; some of them the most precious even, the green Lace-d¾monianmarble, for example, more brilliant in colour thanany other; the Augustan also; and, more recently, the Tiberian;which were first discovered, in the reigns respectively ofAugustus and Tiberius, in Egypt. These two marbles differfrom ophites<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> in the circumstance that the latter is markedwith streaks which resemble serpents<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> in appearance, whenceits name. There is also this difference between the twomarbles themselves, in the arrangement of their spots: theAugustan marble has them undulated and curling to a point;whereas in the Tiberian the streaks are white,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> not involved,but lying wide asunder.</p><p>Of ophites, there are only some very small pillars known tohave been made. There are two varieties of it, one whiteand soft, the other inclining to black, and hard. Both kinds,it is said, worn as an amulet, are a cure for head-ache, and for<pb n="6328" />wounds inflicted by serpents.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> Some, too, recommend thewhite ophites as an amulet for phrenitis and lethargy. As acounter-poison to serpents, some persons speak more particularlyin praise of the ophites that is known as "tephrias,"<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>from its ashy colour. There is also a marble known as"memphites," from the place<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> where it is found, and of anature somewhat analogous to the precious stones. For medicinalpurposes, it is triturated and applied in the form of aliniment, with vinegar, to such parts of the body as requirecauterizing or incision; the flesh becoming quite benumbed,and thereby rendered insensible to pain.</p><p>Porphyrites,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> which is another production of Egypt, is of ared colour: the kind that is mottled with white blotches isknown as "leptospsephos."<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> The quarries there are able tofurnish blocks<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> of any dimensions, however large. VitrasiusPollio, who was steward<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> in Egypt for the Emperor Claudius,brought to Rome from Egypt some statues made of this stone;a novelty which was not very highly approved of, as no onehas since followed his example. The Egyptians, too, havediscovered in ®thiopia the stone known as "basanites;"<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>which in colour and hardness resembles iron, whence thename<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> that has been given to it. A larger block of it hasnever been known than the one forming the group which hasbeen dedicated by the Emperor Vespasianus Augustus in theTemple of Peace. It represents the river Nilus with sixteenchildren sporting around it,<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> symbolical of the sixteen cubits,the extreme height<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> to which, in the most favourable seasons,that river should rise. It is stated, too, that in the Templeof Serapis at Thebes, there is a block not unlike it, whichforms the statue of Memnon<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> there; remarkable, it is said, for<pb n="6329" />emitting a sound each morning when first touched by the raysof the rising sun.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Books III.

The legs,arms, and other parts of the body are covered with inscriptions, whichattest that, in the third century of the Christian era, the priests still practisedupon the credulity of the devotees, by pretending that it emittedsounds. It may possibly have been erected for astronomical purposes, orfor the mystic worship of the sun.
