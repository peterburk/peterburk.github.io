<div2 type="chapter" n="32" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 32.—THE ASPHODEL; FIFTY-ONE REMEDIES.</head><p>The asphodel<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> is one of the most celebrated of all the plants,so much so, indeed, that by some persons it has been called"heroum."<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> Hesiod has mentioned the fact of its growing inrivers, and Dionysius distinguishes it into male and female.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>It has been observed that the bulbs of it, boiled with a ptisan,are remarkably good for consumption and phthisis,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and that<pb n="4418" />bread in which they have been kneaded up with the meal, isextremely wholesome. Nicander<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> recommends also, for thestings of serpents and scorpions, either the stalk, which wehave already<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> spoken of under the name of "anthericus," orelse the seed or bulbs, to be taken in wine, in doses of threedrachmæ; and he says that these should be strewed beneaththe bed, if there is any apprehension of their presence. Theasphodel is prescribed also for wounds inflicted by marineanimals of a venomous nature, and the bite of the land scolopendra. It is quite wonderful how the snails, in Campania,seek the stalk of this plant, and dry it by extracting theinside. The leaves, too, are applied with wine to woundsmade by venomous animals, and the bulbs are beaten up withpolenta and similarly used for affections of the sinews andjoints. It is also a very good plan to rub lichens with themchopped up and mixed with vinegar, and to apply them inwater to putrid sores, as also to inflammations of the tests ormamillæ. Boiled in lees of wine, and applied in a linen pledged,they are used for the cure of defluxions of the eyes.</p><p>Whatever the malady may happen to be, it is generally ina boiled<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> state that the bulbs are employed; but for foululcers of the legs and for chaps upon any part of the body,they are dried and reduced to powder. The bulbs are usuallygathered in autumn,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> a period when their medicinal propertiesare most fully developed. The juice extracted from thempounded, or else a decoction of them, is good, mixed with honey,for pains in the body: it is employed also with dried iris and alittle salt by those who wish to impart an agreeable odour tothe person. The leaves are used for the cure of the variousmaladies above mentioned, as also, boiled in wine, for scrofu-lous sores, inflamed tumours, and ulcers of the face. The ashesof the root are a remedy for alopecy and chaps on the feet;and an extract of the root, boiled in oil, is good for burns andchilblains. It is injected also into the ears for deafness, and,for tooth-ache, it is poured into the ear opposite to the partaffected. A moderate dose of the root, taken in drink, acts as<pb n="4419" />a diuretic and emmenagogue; it is good also for pains in thesides, ruptures, convulsions, and coughs, in doses of one drachma,taken in wine. Chewed, the root promotes vomiting, but theseed, taken internally, disorders the bowels.</p><p>Chrysermus used to employ a decoction of the root, in wine,for imposthumes of the parotid glands; and he has prescribedit, in combination with cachrys,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> in wine, for the cure ofscrofulous sores. Some persons say that if, after applying theroot to the sores, a part of it is hung up in the smoke to dry,and not taken down till the end of four days, the soreswill gradually dry up with this portion of the root. Sophocles<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>used to employ it both ways, boiled and raw, for the cure ofgout; and he prescribes it, boiled in oil, for chilblains, and,in vinegar, for jaundice and dropsy. It has been stated,also, that, used as a friction with wine and honey, or taken indrink, it acts as an aphrodisiac. Xenocrates assures us, too,that a decoction of the root in vinegar removes lichens, itchscabs, and leprous sores; and that a decoction of it, with henbane and tar, has a similar effect, and is good also for the removal of bad odours<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> of the armpits and thighs: he states,also, that if the head is well rubbed with the root, being firstshaved, the hair will curl all the better for it. Simus prescribes a decoction of it, in wine, to be taken for calculi inthe kidneys; and Hippocrates recommends the seed for obstructions of the spleen. The root, or else a decoction of it,applied topically, restores the hair in beasts of burden, where ithas been lost by ulcerations or scab. It has the effect, too, ofdriving away rats and mice, and of exterminating them, ifplaced before their holes.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxi. c. 68.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Plant of the heroes."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Mere varieties of the plant, so called with reference, probably, to therelative energy of their properties.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Regarded in a medicinal point of view the bulb of the asphodel pos-sesses some emollient properties, and nothing more.
