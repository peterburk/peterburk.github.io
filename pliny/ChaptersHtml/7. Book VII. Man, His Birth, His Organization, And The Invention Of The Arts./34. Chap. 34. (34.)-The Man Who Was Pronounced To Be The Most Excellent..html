<div2 type="chapter" n="34" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 34. (34.)ÑTHE MAN WHO WAS PRONOUNCED TO BE THE MOST EXCELLENT.</head><p>Scipio Nasica is the only individual who, since the commencement of the Roman era, has been declared, by a vote ofthe senate, confirmed by oath, to be the most excellent ofmen.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> And yet, the same person, when he was a candidatefor office, was twice stigmatized by a repulse of the Romanpeople. He was not allowed, in fine, to die in his nativecountry,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>Ñno, by Hercules! no more than Socrates, whowas declared by Apollo to be the wisest of men, was permitted to die outside of a prison.<pb n="2180" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We have an account of this in Livy, B. xxix. c. 14, and B. xxxvi. c.40; it is also referred to by Valerius Maximus, B. viii. c. 15.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In consequence of the number of eminent men who bore the nameof Scipio, it is not easy, in all cases, to decide to which of them certaintransactions ought to be referred. In this instance, it has been doubted,whether it was the same Scipio who was twice an unsuccessful candidate forthe consulship, and who died in a foreign country. Livy, B. xxxv. c. 24,remarks, "P. Corn. Cn. F. Scipio" had been an unsuccessful candidatefor the consulship; and afterwards, B. xxxix. c. 40, that "P. and L. Scipio" were unsuccessful candidates for the office of censor. Val. Maximusexpressly states, B. v. c. 3, that it was Scipio Nasica, who, in consequenceof the little estimation in which he was held by his fellow-citizens, wentto Pergamus, and "lived there the remainder of his life, without feelingany regrets for his ungrateful country."ÑB.</p></body>
