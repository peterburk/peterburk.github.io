So it is, however, that he is representedin paintings detaching the rust with his sword.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> The rust ofiron is usually obtained for these purposes by scraping old nailswith a piece of moistened iron. It has the effect of unitingwounds, and is possessed of certain desiccative and astringentproperties. Applied in the form of a liniment, it is curative ofalopecy. Mixed with wax and myrtle-oil, it is applied to granulationsof the eyelids, and pustules in all parts of the body,with vinegar it is used for the cure of erysipelas; and, appliedwith lint, it is curative of itch, whitlows on the fingers, andhang-nails. Used as a pessary with wool, it arrests femaledischarges. Diluted in wine, and kneaded with myrrh, it isapplied to recent wounds, and, with vinegar, to condylomatous6swellings. Employed in the form of a liniment, it alleviatesgout.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There are two versions of this story. In B. xxv. c. 19, Pliny saysthat Achilles cured Telephus by the application of a plant, which fromhim received its name. According to the other account, the oracle haddeclared, that the wound of Telephus, which had been inflicted byAchilles, could only be cured by means of the same weapon which hadcaused it.—B.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">All the statements in this Chapter are to be found in Dioscorides,B. v. c. 93.—B.</p></body>
