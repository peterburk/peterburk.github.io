(29.)—SIX REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE ANTHYLLIUM OR ANTHYLLUM.</head><p>The people of Egypt eat the anthalium,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> but I cannot findthat they make any other use of it; but there is another plantcalled the "anthyllium,"<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> or, by some persons, the "anthyllum," of which there are two kinds: one, similar in its leavesand branches to the lentil, a palm in height, growing in sandysoils exposed to the sun, and of a somewhat saltish taste; theother, bearing a strong resemblance to the chamæpitys,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> butsmaller and more downy, with a purple flower, a strong smell,and growing in stony spots.</p><p>The first kind, mixed with rose-oil and applied with milk,is extremely good for affections of the uterus and all kinds ofsores: it is taken as a potion for strangury and gravel in thekidneys, in doses of three drachmæ. The other kind is takenin drink, with oxymel, in doses of four drachmæ, for indurations of the uterus, gripings of the bowels, and epilepsy.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Cyperus esculentus of Linnæus, the esculent souchet.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The two varieties are identified with the Cressa Cretica and theTeucrium iva of Linnæus.
