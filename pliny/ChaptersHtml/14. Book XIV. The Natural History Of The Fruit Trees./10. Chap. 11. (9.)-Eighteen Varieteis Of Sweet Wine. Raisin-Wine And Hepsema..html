RAISIN-WINE AND HEPSEMA.</head><p>All the luscious wines have but little<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> aroma: the thinnerthe wine the more aroma it has. The colours of wines arefour, white,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> brown,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> blood-coloured,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and black.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> Psythium<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>and melampsythium<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> are varieties of raisin-wine which havethe peculiar flavour of the grape, and not that of wine. Seybelites<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> is a wine grown in Galatia, and Aluntium<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> is awine of Sicily, both of which have the flavour of mulsum.<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span><pb n="3249" />As to sir¾um, by some known as "hepsema," and which inour language is called "sapa,"<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> it is a product of art and notof Nature, being prepared from must boiled down to one-third:when must is boiled down to one-half only, we give it thename of " defrutum." All these mixtures have been devised for the adulteration of honey.<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> As to those varietieswhich we have previously mentioned, their merits dependupon the grape, and the soil in which it is grown. Nextafter the raisin-wine of Crete,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> those of Cilicia and Africa areheld in the highest esteem, both in Italy as well as the adjoining provinces. It is well known that it is made of a grapeto which the Greeks have given the name of "stica," and whichby us is called "apiana:"<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> it is also made of the scirpula.<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>The grapes are left on the vine to dry in the sun, or else areboiled in the dolium.<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> Some persons make this wine of thesweet and early white<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> grape: they leave the grapes todry in the sun, until they have lost pretty nearly half theirweight, after which they crush them and subject them to agentle pressure. They then draw off the juice, and add tothe pulp that is left an equal quantity of well-water, the product of which is raisin-wine of second quality.<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> The morecareful makers not only do this, but take care also after dryingthe grapes to remove the stalks, and then steep the raisins inwine of good quality until they swell, after which they pressthem. This kind of raisin-wine is preferred to all others:with the addition of water, they follow the same plan inmaking the wine of second quality.</p><p>The liquor to which the Greeks give the name of" aigleucos,"<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> is of middle quality, between the sirops and what isproperly called wine; with us it is called "semper mustum."<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span>It is only made by using great precaution, and taking carethat the must does not ferment;<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> such being the state of the<pb n="3250" />must in its transformation into wine. To attain this object, themust is taken from the vat and put into casks, which are immediately plunged into water, and there left to remain untilthe winter solstice is past, and frosty weather has made itsappearance. There is another kind, again, of natural aigleucos,which is known in the province of Narbonensis by the nameof "dulce,"<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> and more particularly in the district of theVocontii. In order to make it, they keep the grape hangingon the tree for a considerable time, taking care to twist thestalk. Some, again, make an incision in the bearing shoot, asdeep as the pith, while others leave the grapes to dry on tiles.The only grape, however, that is used in these various processes is that of the vine known as the "helvennaca."<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span></p><p>Some persons add to the list of these sweet wines thatknown as "diachyton."<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span> It is made by drying grapes in thesun, and then placing them for seven days in a closed placeupon hurdles, some seven Feet from the ground, care beingtaken to protect them at night from the dews: on the eighthday they are trodden out: this method, it is said, produces aliquor of exquisite bouquet and flavour. The liquor known asmelitites<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span> is also one of the sweet wines: it differs frommulsum, in being made of must; to five congii of rough-fla-voured must they put one congius of honey, and one cyathusof salt, and they are then brought to a gentle boil: this mixture is of a rough flavour. Among these varieties, I ought toplace what is known as "protropum;"<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span> such being the namegiven by some to the must that runs spontaneously from thegrapes before they are trodden out. Directly it flows it isput into flaggons, and allowed to ferment; after which it isleft to ripen for forty days in a summer sun, about the risingof the Dog-star.<pb n="3251" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The sweet wines, in modern times, have the most bouquet or aroma.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Albus," pale straw-colour.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Fulvus," amber-colour.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Bright and glowing, like Tent and Burgundy.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Niger," the colour of our port.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Supposed to be a species of Pramnian wine, mentioned in c. 6.
