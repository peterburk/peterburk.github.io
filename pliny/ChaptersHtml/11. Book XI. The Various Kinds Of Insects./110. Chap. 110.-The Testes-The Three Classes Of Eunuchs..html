In the dolphinthey are very long, and are concealed in the lower part of thebelly. In the elephant, also, they are quite concealed. Inoviparous animals they adhere to the interior of the loins:these animals are the most speedy in the venereal congress.Fishes and serpents have no testes, but in place of them theyhave two veins, which run from the renal region to the genitals.The bird known as the "buteo,"<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> has three testes. Man isthe only creature in which the testes are ever broken, eitheraccidentally or by some natural malady; those who are thusafflicted form a third class of half men, in addition to hermaphrodites and eunuchs. In all species of animals the maleis more courageous than the female, with the exception of thepanther and the bear.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably the buzzard; from this story also called the "triorchis."</p></body>
