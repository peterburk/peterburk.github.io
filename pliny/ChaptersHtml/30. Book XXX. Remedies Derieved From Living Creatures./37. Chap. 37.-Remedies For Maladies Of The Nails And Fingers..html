The gall-bladder, too, ofany animal is very useful for this purpose. Malformed nailsare healed with an application of canthlarides and pitch, whichis removed at the end of two days; or else with locusts frielwith he-goat suet; or with an application of mutton suet. Somemix mistletoe and purslain with these ingredients; whileothers, again, use verligrease and mistletoe, removing the application at the end of two days.</p></div2></body>
