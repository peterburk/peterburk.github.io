Inthe case of the kidney-bean<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> it is usual to eat the pod togetherwith the seed. This last may be sown in all kinds of soilsindifferently, between the ides of October<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and the calends ofNovember.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> As soon as ever the leguminous plants begin toripen, they ought to be plucked, for the pods will very soonopen and the seed fall out, in which case it is very difficult tofind: the same is the case, too, with the lupine. But beforewe pass on to the lupine, it will be as well to make some mention of the rape.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A variety of the Phaseolus vulgaris of Linn¾us: the "haricot" ofthe French.
