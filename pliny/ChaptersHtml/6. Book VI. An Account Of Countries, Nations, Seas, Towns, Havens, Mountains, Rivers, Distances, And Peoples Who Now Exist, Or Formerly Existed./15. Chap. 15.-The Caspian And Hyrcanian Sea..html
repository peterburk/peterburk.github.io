<div2 type="chapter" n="15" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 15.—THE CASPIAN AND HYRCANIAN SEA.</head><p>Bursting through, this sea makes a passage from the ScythianOcean into the back of Asia,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> receiving various names from the<pb n="2025" />nations which dwell upon its banks, the two most famous of whichare the Caspian and the Hyrcanian races. Clitarchus is ofopinion that the Caspian Sea is not less in area than the Euxine. Eratosthenes gives the measure of it on the south-east,along the coast of Cadusia<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and Albania, as five thousand fourhundred stadia; thence, through the territories of the Anariaci,the Amardi, and the Hyrcani, to the mouth of the river Zonushe makes four thousand eight hundred stadia, and thence to themouth of the Jaxartes<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> two thousand four hundred; which makesin all a distance of one thousand five hundred and seventy-fivemiles. Artemidorus, however, makes this sum smaller by twenty-five miles. Agrippa bounds the Caspian Sea and the nationsaround it, including Armenia, on the east by the Ocean of theSeres,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> on the west by the chain of the Caucasus, on the southby that of Taurus, and on the north by the Scythian Ocean; andhe states it, so far as its extent is known, to be four hundredand eighty miles in length, and two hundred and ninety inbreadth. There are not wanting, however, some authors whostate that its whole circumference, from the Straits,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> is twothousand five hundred miles.</p><p>Its waters make their way into this sea by a very narrowmouth,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> but of considerable length; and where it begins toenlarge, it curves obliquely with horns in the form of a crescent, just as though it would make a descent from its mouthinto Lake Mæotis, resembling a sickle in shape, as M. Varrosays. The first<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> of its gulfs is called the Scythian Gulf;it is inhabited on both sides, by the Scythians, who hold communication with each other across the Straits,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> the Nomadesbeing on one side, together with the Sauromatæ, divided into<pb n="2026" />tribes with numerous names, and on the other, the Abzoæ, whoare also divided into an equal number. At the entrance, onthe right hand side,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> dwell the Udini, a Scythian tribe, at thevery angle of the mouth. Then along<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> the coast there are theAlbani, the descendants of Jason, it is said; that part of the seawhich lies in front of them, bears the name of ' Albanian.' Thisnation, which lies along the Caucasian chain, comes down, aswe have previously stated,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> as far as the river Cyrus, whichforms the boundary of Armenia and Iberia. Above the maritime coast of Albania and the nation of the Udini, the Sarmatæ,the Utidorsi, and the Aroteres stretch along its shores, and intheir rear the Sauromatian Amazons, already spoken of<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span></p><p>The rivers which run through Albania in their course to thesea are the Casius<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> and the Albanus,<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> and then the Cambyses,<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>which rises in the Caucasian mountains, and next to it theCyrus, rising in those of the Coraxici, as already mentioned.<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> Agrippa states that the whole of this coast, inaccessible from rocks of an immense height, is four hundred andtwenty-five miles in length, beginning from the river Casius.After we pass the mouth of the Cyrus, it begins to be calledthe 'Caspian Sea;' the Caspii being a people who dwell uponits shores.</p><p>In this place it may be as well to correct an error into whichmany persons have fallen, and even those who lately took partwith Corbulo in the Armenian war. The Gates of Iberia,which we have mentioned<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> as the Caucasian, they havespoken of as being called the 'Caspian,' and the colouredplans which have been sent from those parts to Rome havethat name written upon them. The menaced expedition,too, that was contemplated by the Emperor Nero, was saidto be designed to extend as far as the Caspian Gates, where-<pb n="2027" />as it was really intended for those which lead throughIberia into the territory of the Sarmatæ; there being hardlyany possibility of approach to the Caspian Sea, by reason of theclose juxtaposition of the mountains there. There are, however, other Caspian Gates, which join up to the Caspian tribes;but these can only be distinguished from a perusal of the narrative of those who took part in the expedition of Alexander theGreat.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">His meaning is, that the Scythian ocean communicates on the northernshores of Asia with the Caspian Sea.
