<div2 type="chapter" n="14" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 14.—OBELISKS.</head><p>Monarchs, too, have entered into a sort of rivalry with oneanother in forming elongated blocks of this stone, known as"obelisks,"<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and consecrated to the divinity of the Sun.The blocks had this form given to them in resemblance tothe rays of that luminary, which are so called<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> in the Egyptianlanguage.</p><p>Mesphres,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> who reigned in the City of the Sun,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> was thefirst who erected one of these obelisks, being warned to do soin a dream: indeed, there is an inscription upon the obelisk tothis effect; for the sculptures and figures which we still seeengraved thereon are no other than Egyptian letters.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span></p><p>At a later period other kings had these obelisks hewn.Sesosthes<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> erected four of them in the above-named city,forty-eight cubits in height. Rhamsesis,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> too, who was<pb n="6332" />reigning at the time of the capture of Troy, erected one, ahundred and forty cubits high. Having quitted the spotwhere the palace of Mnevis<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> stood, this monarch erectedanother obelisk,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> one hundred and twenty cubits in height,but of prodigious thickness, the sides being no less thaneleven cubits in breadth. (9.) It is said that one hundredand twenty thousand men were employed upon this work;<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>and that the king, when it was on the point of being elevated,being apprehensive that the machinery employed might notprove strong enough for the weight, with the view of increasingthe peril that might be entailed by due want of precautionon the part of the workmen, had his own son fastened to thesummit; in order that the safety of the prince might at thesame time ensure the safety of the mass of stone. It was in hisadmiration of this work, that, when King Cambyses took thecity by storm, and the conflagration had already reached thevery foot of the obelisk, he ordered the fire to be extinguished;he entertaining a respect for this stupendous erection whichhe had not entertained for the city itself.</p><p>There are also two other obelisks, one of them erected byZmarres,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> and the other by Phius;<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> both of them withoutinscriptions, and forty-eight cubits in height. PtolemæusPhiladelphus had one erected at Alexandria, eighty cubitshigh, which had been prepared by order of King Necthebis:<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>it was without any inscription, and cost far more trouble inits carriage and elevation, than had been originally expendedin quarrying it. Some writers inform us that it was conveyedon a raft, under the inspection of the architect Satyrus;but Callixenus<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> gives the name of Phœnix. For this pur-<pb n="6333" />pose, a canal was dug from the river Nilus to the spot wherethe obelisk lay; and two broad vessels, laden with blocks ofsimilar stone a foot square, the cargo of each amounting todouble the size, and consequently double the weight, of theobelisk, were brought beneath it; the extremities of theobelisk remaining supported by the opposite sides of the canal.The blocks of stone were then removed, and the vessels, beingthus gradually lightened, received their burden. It waserected upon a basis of six square blocks, quarried from thesame mountain, and the artist was rewarded with the sum offifty talents.<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> This obelisk was placed by the king abovementionedin the Arsinoœum,<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> in testimony of his affection forhis wife and sister Arsinoë. At a later period, as it was foundto be an inconvenience to the docks, Maximus, the then præfectof Egypt, had it transferred to the Forum there, after removingthe summit for the purpose of substituting a gilded point; anintention which was ultimately abandoned.</p><p>There are two other obelisks, which were in Cæsar's Templeat Alexandria, near the harbour there, forty-two cubits inheight, and originally hewn by order of King Mesphres. Butthe most difficult enterprise of all, was the carriage of theseobelisks by sea to Rome, in vessels which excited the greatestadmiration. Indeed, the late Emperor Augustus consecratedthe one which brought over the first obelisk, as a lastingmemorial of this marvellous undertaking, in the docks atPuteoli; but it was destroyed by fire. As to the one in which,by order of the Emperor Caius,<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> the other obelisk had beentransported to Rome, after having been preserved for someyears and looked upon as the most wonderful construction everbeheld upon the seas, it was brought to Ostia, by order of thelate Emperor Claudius; and towers of Puteolan<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> earth beingfirst erected upon it, it was sunk for the construction of theharbour which he was making there. And then, besides, therewas the necessity of constructing other vessels to carry theseobelisks up the Tiber; by which it became practically ascer-<pb n="6334" />tained, that the depth of water in that river is not less thanthat of the river Nilus.</p><p>The obelisk that was erected by the late Emperor Augustusin the Great Circus,<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> was originally quarried by order of KingSemenpserteus,<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> in whose reign it was that Pythagoras<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> visitedEgypt. It is eighty-five feet<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> and three quarters in height,exclusive of the base, which is a part of the same stone. Theone that he erected in the Campus Martius, is nine feet less inheight, and was originally made by order of Sesothis. Theyare both of them covered with inscriptions, which interpretthe operations of Nature according to the philosophy of theEgyptians.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Obelisci."
