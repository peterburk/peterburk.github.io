(20.)ÑTHREE VARIETIES OF THE MEDLAR.</head><p>The medlar and the sorb<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> ought in propriety to be rankedunder the head of the apple and the pear. Of the medlar<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>there are three varieties, the anthedon,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> the setania,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and athird of inferior quality, which bears a stronger resemblanceto the anthedon, and is known as the Gallic<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> kind. The setania is the largest fruit, and the palest in colour; the woody seedin the inside of it is softer, too, than in the others, which are ofsmaller size than the setania, but superior to it in the fragranceof their smell, and in being better keepers. The tree itself isone of very ample<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> dimensions: the leaves turn red before theyfall: the roots are numerous, and penetrate remarkably deep,which renders it almost impossible to grub it up. This tree<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>did not exist in Italy in Cato's time.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The sorb belongs to the genus pirus of the naturalists.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Mespilus germanica of the botanists.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The azarolier, a tree of the south of Europe, the Mespilus apii foliolaciniato of C.
