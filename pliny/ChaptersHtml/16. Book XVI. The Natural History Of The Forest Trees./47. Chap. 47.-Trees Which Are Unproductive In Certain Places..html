This distinction may arise also from the sex; andwhen such is the case, it is the male<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> tree that never produces.Some authors, however, making a transposition, assert that itis the male trees only that are prolific. Barrenness may alsoarise from a tree being too thickly covered with leaves.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xv. c 13. It is not impossible that Pliny may have mistakenhere the Persea, or Balanites Ægyptiaca, for the Persica, or peach. See p. 296.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Fée remarks, that this expression is remarkable as giving a just notionof the relative functions of the male and female in plants. He says thatone might almost be tempted to believe that they suspected somethingof the nature and functions of the pistils and stamens.</p></body>
