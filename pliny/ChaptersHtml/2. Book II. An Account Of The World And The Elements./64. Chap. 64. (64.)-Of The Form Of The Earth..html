<div2 type="chapter" n="64" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 64. (64.)—OF THE FORM OF THE EARTH.</head><p>Every one agrees that it has the most perfect figure<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>.We always speak of the ball of the earth, and we admit itto be a globe bounded by the poles. It has not indeed theform of an absolute sphere, from the number of lofty mountains and flat plains; but if the termination of the lines bebounded by a curve<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>, this would compose a perfect sphere.And this we learn from arguments drawn from the nature ofthings, although not from the same considerations which wemade use of with respect to the heavens. For in these thehollow convexity everywhere bends on itself, and leans uponthe earth as its centre. Whereas the earth rises up solidand dense, like something that swells up and is protrudedoutwards. The heavens bend towards the centre, while theearth goes from the centre, the continual rolling of theheavens about it forcing its immense globe into the form ofa sphere<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"figura prima." I may refer to the second chapter of this book,where the author remarked upon the form of the earth as perfect in allits parts, and especially adapted for its supposed position in the centre ofthe universe.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"....si capita linearum comprehendantur ambitu;" the meaningof this passage would appear to be: if the extremities of the lines drawnfrom the centre of the earth to the different parts of the surface were connected together, the result of the whole would be a sphere. I must, however, remark, that Hardouin interprets it in a somewhat different manner;"Si per extremitates linearum ductarum a centro ad <hi rend="ital">summos</hi> quosquevertices montium circulus exigatur." Lemaire, i. 370.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"....immensum ejus globum in formam orbis assidua circa eammundi volubilitate cogente." As Hardouin remarks, the word <hi rend="ital">mundus</hi>is here used in the sense of <hi rend="ital">cœlum.</hi> Lemaire, i. 371.</p></body>
