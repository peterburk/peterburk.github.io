(11.)—THE CONCEPTION AND GENERATION OF MAN.</head><p>Few animals, except the female of the human species, receive the male when pregnant. In only one or two species, andno more, does superfœtation ever take place.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> Cases are tobe found stated in the journals of physicians, and of others whohave paid particular attention to the subject, in which twelveembryos<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> have been removed at a single abortion. When,however, but a very short time has intervened between twoconceptions, the embryos both of them proceed to maturity;as was seen to be the case with Hercules and his brotherIphicles.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> This was the case also with the woman who broughtforth two children at a birth, one of whom bore a resemblanceto her husband, and the other to her paramour. So too, witha female slave in Proconnesus,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> who was delivered of twochildren at one birth, one of whom bore a strong resemblanceto her master, and the other to her master's steward, withboth of whom she had had connection on the same day; withanother woman who was delivered of two children at a birth,the one after the usual period of gestation, the other an em-<pb n="2145" />bryo only five months old: and again, with another female,who, having been delivered of one child at the end of sevenmonths, in due course, two months afterwards, brought forthtwins.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hardouin says, that this is the case with the hare and the dasypus,which is a species of hare; but there is probably no foundation for thestatement. Pliny repeats it in a subsequent passage, B. viii. c. 81.—B.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny evidently considers this a case of superfœtation, and looks uponit as not uncommon in the human species: whereas it is now consideredimpossible.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This refers to the mythological tale of Jupiter and Amphitryon.—B.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. v. c. 41.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Most of these statements appear to be taken from Aristotle, Hist.Anim.—B.</p></body>
