The most highly esteemedof all is deer's marrow, the next best being that of the calf, andthen that of the goat, both male and female. These substancesare prepared before autumn, by washing them in a fresh state,and drying them in the shade; after which they are passedthrough a sieve, and then strained through linen, and put byin earthen pots for keeping, in a cool spot.</p></div2></body>
