<div2 type="chapter" n="85" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 85. (59.)ÑHOW THE FISH CALLED THE ANTHIASIS TAKEN.</head><p>Nor would it be right to omit what is said about the fish calledanthias, and which I find is looked upon as true by mostwriters. I have already mentioned<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> the Chelidoni¾, certainislands off the coast of Asia; they are situate off a promontorythere, in the midst of a sea full of crags and reefs. These partsare much frequented by this fish, which is very speedily takenby the employment of a single method of catching it. A fisherman pushes out in a little boat, dressed in a colour resemblingthat of his boat; and every day, for several days together, atthe same hour, he sails over the same space, while doing whichhe throws a quantity of bait into the sea. Whatever is thrownfrom the boat is an object of suspicion to the fish, who keepat a distance from what causes them so much alarm; but afterthis has been repeated a considerable number of times, one ofthe fish, reassured by becoming habituated to the scene, at lastsnaps at the bait. The movements of this one are watchedwith the greatest care and attention, for in it are centred allthe hopes of the fishermen, as it is to be the means of securingthem their prey; nor, indeed, is it difficult to recognize it,seeing that for some days it is the only one that ventures tocome near the bait. At last, however, it finds some others tofollow its example, and by degrees it is better and betterattended, till at last it brings with it shoals innumerable.The older ones, at length becoming quite accustomed to thefisherman, easily recognize him, and will even take food fromhis hands. Upon this, the man throws out, a little way beyondthe tips of his fingers, a hook concealed in a bait, and smuggles them out one by one, rather than catches them, standingin the shadow of the boat and whipping them out of the waterwith a slight jerk, that the others may not perceive it;while another fisherman is ready inside to receive them uponpieces of cloth, in order that no floundering about or othernoise may scare the others away. It is of importance to know<pb n="2474" />which has been the betrayer of the others, and not to take it,otherwise the shoal will take to flight, and appear no more forthe future.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> There is a story that a fisherman, having quarrelled once with his mate, threw out a hook to one of theseleading fishes, which he easily recognized, and so captured itwith a malicious intent. The fish, however, was recognizedin the market by the other fisherman, against whom he hadconceived this malice; who accordingly brought an actionagainst him for damages;<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and, as Mucianus adds, he wascondemned to pay them on the hearing of the case. Theseanthi¾, it is said, when they see one of their number takenwith a hook, cut the line with the serrated spines which theyhave on the back, the one that is held fast stretching it outas much as it can, to enable them to cut it. But among thesargi, the fish itself, that is held fast, rubs the line asunderagainst the rocks.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">B. v. c, 35.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Oppian, Halieut.
