But the main difference between it and the cro-codile is in the arrangement of the scales, which run from thetail towards the head. The largest of these animals is the Indianscincus, and next to it that of Arabia; they are brought heresalted. The muzzle and fat of the scincus, taken in whitewine, act as an aphrodisiac; when used with satyrion<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> androcket-seed more particularly, in the proportion of one drachmaof each, mixed with two drachm¾ of pepper; the whole beingmade up into lozenges of one drachma each, and so taken indrink. The flesh from the flanks, taken internally in a similarmanner, in doses of two oboli, with myrrh and pepper, isgenerally thought to be productive of a similar effect, and tobe even more efficacious for the purpose. According to Apelles,the flesh of the scincus is good for wounds inflicted by poisonedarrows, whether taken before or after the wound is inflicted:it is used as an ingredient, also, in the most celebrated anti-dotes. Sextius tells us, that, taken in doses of more than onedrachma, in one semisextarius of wine, the flesh is productive ofdeadly results: he adds, too, that a broth prepared from it.taken with honey, acts as an antaphrodisiac.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. viii. c. 33.
