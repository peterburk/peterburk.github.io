The bestkinds grow in the vicinity of Cnidos, or in Caria, in spots thatare destitute of water, or else in dry and rugged localities. A<pb n="3155" />bryon of second-rate quality is produced from the cedar ofLycia.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> Înanthe, too, bears an affinity to these substances,being the clusters of the wild vine: it is gathered when it isin flower, or, in other words, when it has the finest smell:after which it is dried in the shade upon a linen sheet spreadbeneath it, and then stored away in casks. The best sort isthat which comes from Parapotamia;<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> the next best kinds arethose made at Antiochia and Laodicea in Syria; and that ofthird-rate quality, comes from the mountainous parts of Media;this last, however, is preferable for medicinal purposes. Somepersons give the preference over all to that grown in theisland of Cyprus. As to that which comes from Africa, itis solely used for medicinal purposes, being known by thename of massaris.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> Whatever country it may happen to be,the white wild vine produces an Ïnanthe of superior qualityto the black.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From the Greek <foreign lang="greek">bo|u/on,</foreign> "moss."

FŽe is of opinion, that theblossoms or buds of the tree are meant, which have a fragrant smell. Thisis the more probable, as we find Pliny here speaking of the ¾nanthe, or vine-flower, by which FŽe supposes that he means the blossom of the Vitisvinifera of Linn¾us, which exhales a delightful perfume.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The bud, probably, of the Juniperus Lycia.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. vi. c. 31.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Said to have been a surname given by some nations to the god Bacchus.</p></body>
