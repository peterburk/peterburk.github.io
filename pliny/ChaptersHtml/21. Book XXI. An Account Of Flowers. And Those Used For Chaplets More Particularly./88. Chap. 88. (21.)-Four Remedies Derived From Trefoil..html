<div2 type="chapter" n="88" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 88. (21.)—FOUR REMEDIES DERIVED FROM TREFOIL.</head><p>The trefoil,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> I know, is generally looked upon as being par-<pb n="4375" />ticularly good for the stings of serpents and scorpions, the seedbeing taken in doses of twenty grains, with either wine oroxycrate; or else the leaves and the plant itself are boiled together, and a decoction made of them; indeed, it is stated, thata serpent is never to be seen among trefoil. Celebrated authors,too, I find, have asserted that twenty-five grains of the seed ofthe kind of trefoil which we have<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> spoken of as the "minyanthes," are a sufficient antidote for all kinds of poisons: in addition to which, there are numerous other remedial virtuesascribed to it.</p><p>But these notions, in my opinion, are counterbalanced bythe authority of a writer of the very highest repute: for wefind the poet Sophocles asserting that the trefoil is a venomousplant. Simus, too, the physician, maintains that a decoctionof it, or the juice, poured upon the human body, is productiveof burning sensations similar to those experienced by personswhen they have been stung by a serpent and have trefoil applied to the wound. It is my opinion, then, that trefoil shouldnever be used in any other capacity than as a counter-poison;for it is not improbable that the venom of this plant has anatural antipathy to all other kinds of poisons, a phænomenonwhich has been observed in many other cases as well. I findit stated, also, that the seed of the trefoil with an extremelydiminutive leaf, applied in washes to the face, is extremelybeneficial for preserving the freshness of the skin in females.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See c. 30 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In c. 30 of this Book.</p></body>
