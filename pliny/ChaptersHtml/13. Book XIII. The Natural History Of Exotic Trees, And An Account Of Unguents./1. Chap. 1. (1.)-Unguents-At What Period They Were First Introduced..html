(1.)—UNGUENTS—AT WHAT PERIOD THEY WERE FIRSTINTRODUCED.</head><p>THUS far we have been speaking of the trees which arevaluable for the odours they produce, and each of which is asubject for our wonder in itself. Luxury, however, hasthought fit to mingle all of these, and to make a single odourof the whole; hence it is that unguents have been invented.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>Who was the first to make unguents is a fact not recorded.In the times of the Trojan war<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> they did not exist, nor didthey use incense when sacrificing to the gods; indeed, peopleknew of no other smell, or rather stench,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> I may say, than thatof the cedar and the citrus,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> shrubs of their own growth, as itarose in volumes of smoke from the sacrifices; still, however,even then, the extract of roses was known, for we find it mentioned as conferring additional value on olive-oil.</p><p>We ought, by good rights, to ascribe the first use of unguents to the Persians, for they quite soak themselves in it,and so, by an adventitious recommendation, counteract thebad odours which are produced by dirt. The first instance ofthe use of unguents that I have been able to meet with is that ofthe chest<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> of perfumes which fell into the hands of Alexander,with the rest of the property of King Darius, at the taking of his<pb n="3160" />camp.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> Since those times this luxury has been adopted byour own countrymen as well, among the most prized and, indeed, the most elegant of all the enjoyments of life, and hasbegun even to be admitted in the list of honours paid to thedead; for which reason we shall have to enlarge further onthat subject. Those perfumes which are not the produce ofshrubs<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> will only be mentioned for the present by name: thenature of them will, however, be stated in their appropriateplaces.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Fée remarks, that most of the unguents and perfumes of which Plinyhere speaks would find but little favour at the present day.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This does not appear to be exactly the case, for in the twenty-thirdBook of the Iliad, 1. 186, we find "rose-scented" oil mentioned, indeed,Pliny himself alludes to it a little further on.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Nidorem." This term was used in reference to the smell of burnt orroasted animal substances. It is not improbable that he alludes to thestench arising from the burnt sacrifices.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The "Thuya articulata."

See B. vii. c. 30.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The use of perfumes more probably originated in India, than amongthe Persians.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">But of seeds or plants</p></body>
