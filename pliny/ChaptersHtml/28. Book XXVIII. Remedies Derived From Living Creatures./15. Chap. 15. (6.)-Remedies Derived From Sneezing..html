(6.)ÑREMEDIES DERIVED FROM SNEEZING.</head><p>Sneezing, provoked by a feather, relieves heaviness in thehead; it is said too, that to touch the nostrils of a mule withthe lips, will arrest sneezing and hiccup. For this last purpose, Varro recommends us to scratch the palm, first of onehand and then of the other; while many say that it is a goodplan to shift the ring from off the left hand to the longest fingerof the right, and then to plunge the hands into hot water.Theophrastus says, that aged persons sneeze with greater difficulty than others.</p></div2></body>
