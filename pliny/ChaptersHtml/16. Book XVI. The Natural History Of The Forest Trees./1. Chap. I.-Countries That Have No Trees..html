<div2 type="chapter" n="1" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. I.—COUNTRIES THAT HAVE NO TREES.</head><p>WE have given the precedence in this account to the fruit-trees and others which, by their delicious juices, first taughtman to give a relish to his food and the various alimentsrequisite for his sustenance, whether it is that they spontaneously produce these delightful flavours, or whether we haveimparted them by the methods of adoption and intermarriage,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>thus bestowing a favour, as it were, upon the very beasts andbirds. The next thing, then, would be to speak of the glandi-ferous trees, the trees which proffered the earliest nutrimentto the appetite of man, and proved themselves his foster-mothers in his forlorn and savage state—did I not feel myselfconstrained on this occasion to make some mention of the surprise which I have felt on finding by actual experience whatis the life of mortals when they inhabit a country that is without either tree or shrub.</p><p>(1.) I have already stated<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> that in the East many nationsthat dwell on the shores of the ocean are placed in this necessitous state; and I myself have personally witnessed the condition of the Chauci,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> both the Greater and the Lesser, situatein the regions of the far North. In those climates a vast tractof land, invaded twice each day and night by the overflowingwaves of the ocean, opens a question that is eternally proposedto us by Nature, whether these regions are to be looked uponas belonging to the land, or whether as forming a portion ofthe sea?</p><p>Here a wretched race is found, inhabiting either the moreelevated spots of land, or else eminences artificially constructed,and of a height to which they know by experience that thehighest tides will never reach. Here they pitch their cabins;<pb n="3340" />and when the waves cover the surrounding country far andwide, like so many mariners on board ship are they: when,again, the tide recedes, their condition is that of so manyshipwrecked men, and around their cottages they pursue thefishes as they make their escape with the receding tide. It isnot their lot, like the adjoining nations, to keep any flocks forsustenance by their milk, nor even to maintain a warfare withwild beasts, every shrub, even, being banished afar. With thesedge<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and the rushes of the marsh they make cords, andwith these they weave the nets employed in the capture of thefish; they fashion the mud,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> too, with their hands, and dryingit by the help of the winds more than of the sun, cook theirfood by its aid, and so warm their entrails, frozen as theyare by the northern blasts; their only<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> drink, too, is rainwater, which they collect in holes dug at the entrance of theirabodes: and yet these nations, if this very day they were vanquished by the Roman people, would exclaim against beingreduced<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> to slavery! Be it so, then—Fortune is most kind tomany, just when she means to punish them.<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The methods of grafting and inoculation.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">B. xiii. c. 50.
