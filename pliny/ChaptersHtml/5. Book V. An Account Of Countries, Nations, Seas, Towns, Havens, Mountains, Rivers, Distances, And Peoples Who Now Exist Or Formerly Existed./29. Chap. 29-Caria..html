<div2 type="chapter" n="29" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 29—CARIA.</head><p>Upon the adjoining coast is Caria<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>, then Ionia, and beyondit Æolis. Caria surrounds Doris, which lies in the middle,and runs down on both sides of it to the sea. In it<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> is thePromontory of Pedalium<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>, the river Glaucus<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, into whichthe Telmedium<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> discharges itself, the towns of Dædala<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>,Crya<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>, peopled by fugitives, the river Axon<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>, and the townof Calynda<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>.<pb n="1459" /></p><p>(28.) The river Indus<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>, which rises in the mountains ofthe Cibyratæ<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>, receives sixty-five rivers which are constantlyflowing, besides upwards of 100 mountain torrents. Hereis the free town of Caunos<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>, then the town of Pyrnos<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>, theport of Cressa<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>, from which the island of Rhodes is distanttwenty miles; the place where Loryma formerly stood, thetowns of Tisanusa<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>, Paridion<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span>, and Larymna<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span>, the Gulf ofThymnias<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span>, the Promontory of Aphrodisias<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span>, the town ofHyda, the Gulf of Schœnus, and the district of Bubasus<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span>.There was formerly the town of Acanthus here, another<pb n="1460" />name of which was Dulopolis. We then come to Cnidos<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span>,a free town, situate on a promontory, Triopia<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span>, and afterthat the towns of Pegusa and Stadia.</p><p>At this last town Doris begins; but, first, it may be aswell to describe the districts that lie to the back of Cariaand the several jurisdictions in the interior. The first ofthese<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span> is called Cibyratica; Cibyra being a town of Phrygia.Twenty-five states resort to it for legal purposes, togetherwith the most famous city of Laodicea<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span>.</p><p>(29.) This place at first bore the name of Diospolis, andafter that of Rhoas, and is situate on the river Lycus, theAsopus and the Caprus<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span> washing its sides. The other peoplebelonging to the same jurisdiction, whom it may be notamiss to mention, are the Hydrelitæ<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span>, the Themisones<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span>, andthe Hierapolitæ<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span>. The second jurisdiction receives its title<pb n="1461" />from Synnas<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span>; to it resort the Lycaones<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span>, the Appiani<span id="ref_31"><a href="#note_31">[31]</a></span>,the Eucarpeni<span id="ref_32"><a href="#note_32">[32]</a></span>, the Dorylæi<span id="ref_33"><a href="#note_33">[33]</a></span>, the Midæi, the Julienses<span id="ref_34"><a href="#note_34">[34]</a></span>, andfifteen other peoples of no note. The third jurisdiction hasits seat at Apamea<span id="ref_35"><a href="#note_35">[35]</a></span>, formerly called Celænæ<span id="ref_36"><a href="#note_36">[36]</a></span>, and after thatCibotos. This place is situate at the foot of Mount Signia,the Marsyas, the Obrima, and the Orga, rivers which fallinto the Mæander, flowing past it. Here the Marsyas,rising from the earth, again makes its appearance, but soonafter buries itself once more at Aulocreneæ<span id="ref_37"><a href="#note_37">[37]</a></span>, the spot where<pb n="1462" />Marsyas had the musical contest with Apollo as to superiority of skill in playing on the flute. Aulocrenæ is thename given to a valley which lies ten miles on the roadtowards Phrygia from Apamea. As belonging to this jurisdiction, it may be as well to mention the Metropolitæ<span id="ref_38"><a href="#note_38">[38]</a></span>, theDionysopolitæ<span id="ref_39"><a href="#note_39">[39]</a></span>, th&gt;e Euphorbeni<span id="ref_40"><a href="#note_40">[40]</a></span>, the Aemonenses<span id="ref_41"><a href="#note_41">[41]</a></span>, the Pelteni<span id="ref_42"><a href="#note_42">[42]</a></span>, and the Silbiani<span id="ref_43"><a href="#note_43">[43]</a></span>, besides nine other nations of no note.</p><p>Upon the Gulf of Doris<span id="ref_44"><a href="#note_44">[44]</a></span> we have Leucopolis, Hamaxitos,Eleus, and Euthene<span id="ref_45"><a href="#note_45">[45]</a></span>. We then come to Pitaium, Eutane<span id="ref_46"><a href="#note_46">[46]</a></span>,and Halicarnassus<span id="ref_47"><a href="#note_47">[47]</a></span>, towns of Caria. To the jurisdiction ofthis last place six towns were appended by Alexander theGreat, Theangela<span id="ref_48"><a href="#note_48">[48]</a></span>, Sibde, Medmasa, Euralium, Pedasus,and Telmissus<span id="ref_49"><a href="#note_49">[49]</a></span>. Halicarnassus lies between two gulfs,those of Ceramus<span id="ref_50"><a href="#note_50">[50]</a></span> and Iasus<span id="ref_51"><a href="#note_51">[51]</a></span>. We then come to Myn-<pb n="1463" />dos<span id="ref_52"><a href="#note_52">[52]</a></span>, and the former site of Palæomyndos; also Nariandos,Neapolis<span id="ref_53"><a href="#note_53">[53]</a></span>, Caryanda<span id="ref_54"><a href="#note_54">[54]</a></span>, the free town of Termera<span id="ref_55"><a href="#note_55">[55]</a></span>, Bargyla<span id="ref_56"><a href="#note_56">[56]</a></span>,and the town of Iasus<span id="ref_57"><a href="#note_57">[57]</a></span>, from which the Iasian Gulf takesits name.</p><p>Caria is especially distinguished for the fame of its placesin the interior; for here are Mylasa<span id="ref_58"><a href="#note_58">[58]</a></span>, a free town, and thatof Antiochia<span id="ref_59"><a href="#note_59">[59]</a></span>, on the site of the former towns of Symmæthos and Cranaos: it is now surrounded by the riversMæander<span id="ref_60"><a href="#note_60">[60]</a></span> and Orsinus<span id="ref_61"><a href="#note_61">[61]</a></span>. In this district also was formerlyMæandropolis<span id="ref_62"><a href="#note_62">[62]</a></span>; we find also Eumenia<span id="ref_63"><a href="#note_63">[63]</a></span>, situate on the riverCludros, the river Glaucus<span id="ref_64"><a href="#note_64">[64]</a></span>, the town of Lysias and Orthosa<span id="ref_65"><a href="#note_65">[65]</a></span>,<pb n="1464" />the district of Berecynthus<span id="ref_66"><a href="#note_66">[66]</a></span>, Nysa<span id="ref_67"><a href="#note_67">[67]</a></span>, and Tralles<span id="ref_68"><a href="#note_68">[68]</a></span>, also calledEuanthia<span id="ref_69"><a href="#note_69">[69]</a></span>, Seleucia, and Antiochia: it is washed by theriver Eudon, while the Thebais runs through it. Someauthors say that a nation of Pygmies formerly dwelt here.Besides the preceding towns, there are Thydonos, Pyrrha<span id="ref_70"><a href="#note_70">[70]</a></span>,Eurome<span id="ref_71"><a href="#note_71">[71]</a></span>, Heraclea<span id="ref_72"><a href="#note_72">[72]</a></span>, Amyzon<span id="ref_73"><a href="#note_73">[73]</a></span>, the free town of Alabanda<span id="ref_74"><a href="#note_74">[74]</a></span>,which has given name to that jurisdiction, the free town ofStratonicea<span id="ref_75"><a href="#note_75">[75]</a></span>, Hynidos, Ceramus<span id="ref_76"><a href="#note_76">[76]</a></span>, Trœzene<span id="ref_77"><a href="#note_77">[77]</a></span>, and Phorontis.<pb n="1465" />At a greater distance<span id="ref_78"><a href="#note_78">[78]</a></span>, but resorting to the same place ofjurisdiction, are the Orthronienses, the Alindienses<span id="ref_79"><a href="#note_79">[79]</a></span> or Hippini, the Xystiani<span id="ref_80"><a href="#note_80">[80]</a></span>, the Hydissenses, the Apolloniataæ<span id="ref_81"><a href="#note_81">[81]</a></span>, theTrapezopolitæ<span id="ref_82"><a href="#note_82">[82]</a></span>, and the Aphrodisienses<span id="ref_83"><a href="#note_83">[83]</a></span>, a free people. Besides the above, there are the towns of Coscinus<span id="ref_84"><a href="#note_84">[84]</a></span>, and Harpasa<span id="ref_85"><a href="#note_85">[85]</a></span>, situate on the river Harpasus<span id="ref_86"><a href="#note_86">[86]</a></span>, which also passed thetown of Trallicon when it was in existence.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In the south-west corner of Asia Minor, bounded on the north andnorth-east by the mountains Messagis and Cadmus, dividing it fromLydia and Phrygia, and adjoining to Phrygia and Lycia on the south-east.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Caria.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Cape Ghinazi. It was also called Artemisium, from the templeof Artemis or Diana situate upon it.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Discharging itself into the bay of Telmissus, now Makri.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Telmissus" is the reading here in some editions.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Situate in the district of Caria called Peræa. It was also the namegiven to a mountainous district. In Hoskyn's map the ruins of Dædalaare placed near the head of the Gulf of Glaucus, on the west of a smallriver called Inegi Chai, probably the ancient Ninus, where Dædalus wasbitten by a water-snake, in consequence of which he died.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">On the Gulf of Glaucus: Stephanus however places it in Lycia.Mela speaks only of a promontory of this name.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Leake places this river immediately west of the Gulf of Glaucus.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Placed by Strabo sixty stadia from the sea, west of the Gulf ofGlaucus, and east of Carinus. Its site is uncertain, but it may possiblybe the place discovered by Fellows, which is proved by inscriptions tohave been called Cadyanda, a name otherwise unknown to us. This lies N.N.E. of Makri, on the Gulf of Glaucus or Makri, at a place calledHoozoomlee, situate on an elevated plain.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The same as the river Calbis of Strabo and Mela, at present the Dalamon Tchy, Quingi or Taas, having its sources in Mount Cadmus above Cibyra. It was said to have derived its name from an Indian, who had been thrown into it from an elephant.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Their district was Cibyratis, of which the chief city was Cibyra. This place, uniting with the towns of Balbura, Bubon, and Œnianda, had the name of Tetrapolis; of which league Cibyra was the head, mustering 30,000 infantry and 2000 cavalry. The iron found in this district was easily cut with a chisel or other sharp tool. The site of this powerful city has been ascertained to be at Horzoom, on the Horzoom Tchy, a branch of the Dalamon Tchy or Indus. The ruins are very extensive, and the theatre in fine preservation.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Placed by Strabo west of Calynda. The ancient descriptions of its locality vary, but the place now known as Kaiguez is said to denote its site. The Caunii are frequently mentioned in the Persian, Grecian, and Roman histories. It was noted for its dried figs, mentioned by Pliny in B. xv. c. 19.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Supposed by Mannert to be the Physcus of Strabo and the Phuscæ of Ptolemy.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Leake says that this harbour is now called Aplothíka by the Greeks, and Porto Cavaliere by the Italians. He also says that on its western shore are the ruins of an Hellenic fortress and town, which are undoubtedly those of Loryma.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It had a port of the same name.</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Called Pandion by Mela, according to Parisot.</p><p><span id="note_17"><a href="#ref_17">17. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Parisot suggests that it is the same as Loryma previously mentioned.</p><p><span id="note_18"><a href="#ref_18">18. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Like the Gulf of Schœnus, a portion probably of the Dorian Gulf, now the Gulf of Syme.</p><p><span id="note_19"><a href="#ref_19">19. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The modern name of this promontory is not given by Hamilton, who sailed round it. It has been confounded with the Cynos Sema of Strabo, now Cape Velo. The site of Hyda or Hyde is unknown.</p><p><span id="note_20"><a href="#ref_20">20. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There was a town of this name as well. Stephen of Byzantium tells us that it received its name from a shepherd who saved the life of Podalirius, when shipwrecked on the coast of Caria.</p><p><span id="note_21"><a href="#ref_21">21. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Part of it was situate on an island now called Cape Krio, connected by a causeway with the mainland. Its site is covered with ruins of a most interesting character in every direction. The Triopian promontory, evidently alluded to by Pliny, is the modern Cape Krio.</p><p><span id="note_22"><a href="#ref_22">22. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It has been remarked that in his description here Pliny is very brief and confused, and that he may intend to give the name of Triopia either to the small peninsula or island, or may include in this term the western part of the whole of the larger peninsula.</p><p><span id="note_23"><a href="#ref_23">23. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Of these <hi rend="ital">conventus.</hi> For an account of Cibyra see last page.</p><p><span id="note_24"><a href="#ref_24">24. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">On the Lycus, now known as the Choruk-Su. By different writers it has been assigned to Lydia, Caria, and Phrygia, but in the ultimate division of the Roman provinces it was assigned to the Greater Phrygia. It was founded by Antiochus II. on the site of a previous town, and named in honour of his wife Laodice. Its site is occupied by ruins of great magnificence. In the Apostolic age it was the seat of a flourishing Christian Church, which however very soon gave signs of degeneracy, as we learn from St. John's Epistle to it, Revel. ii. 14–22. St. Paul also addresses it in common with the neighbouring church of Colossæ. Its site is now called Eski-Hissar, or the Old Castle.</p><p><span id="note_25"><a href="#ref_25">25. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A tributary of the Phrygian Mæander.</p><p><span id="note_26"><a href="#ref_26">26. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The people of Hydrela, a town of Caria, said to have been founded by one of three brothers who emigrated from Sparta.</p><p><span id="note_27"><a href="#ref_27">27. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The people of Themisonium, now called Tseni.</p><p><span id="note_28"><a href="#ref_28">28. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The people of Hierapolis, a town of Phrygia, situate on a height between the rivers Lycus and Mæander, about five miles north of Laodicea, on the road from Apamea to Sardis. It was celebrated for its warm springs, and its Plutonium, or cave of Pluto, from which issued a mephitic vapour of a poisonous nature; see B. ii. c. 95. The Christian Church here is alluded to by St. Paul in his Epistle to the Colossians, iv. 13. Its ruins are situate at an uninhabited place called Pambuk-Kalessi.</p><p><span id="note_29"><a href="#ref_29">29. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Situate in the north of Phrygia Salutaris; its ruins being probably those to be seen at Afiour-Kara-Hisar. From the time of Constantine this place became the capital of Phrygia Salutaris. It stood in a fiuitful plain, near a mountain quarry of the celebrated Synnadic marble, which was white with red veins and spots. This marble was also called "Docimiticus," from Docimia, a nearer place.</p><p><span id="note_30"><a href="#ref_30">30. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">As already mentioned in C. 25 of the present Book.</p><p><span id="note_31"><a href="#ref_31">31. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The site of Appia does not appear to be known. Cicero speaks of an application made to him by the Appiani, when he was governor of Cilicia, respecting the taxes with which they were burdened, and the buildings of their town.</p><p><span id="note_32"><a href="#ref_32">32. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Eucarpia was a town of Phrygia, not far from the sources of the Mæander, on the road from Dorylæum to Apamea Cibotus. The vine grew there in great luxuriance, and to its fruitfulness the town probably owed its name. Kiepert places it in the vicinity of Segielar, but its exact site is unknown.</p><p><span id="note_33"><a href="#ref_33">33. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The site of Dorylæum is now called Eski-Shehr. The hot-baths here are mentioned by Athenæus, and its waters were pleasant to the taste. Sheep-feeding appears to have been carried on here to a great extent, and under the Greek empire it was a flourishing place. The site of Midæum does not seem to be known.</p><p><span id="note_34"><a href="#ref_34">34. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The people of Julia, Juliopolis, or Julianopolis, a town of Lydia, probably to the south of Mount Tmolus.</p><p><span id="note_35"><a href="#ref_35">35. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This place was built near Celænæ by Antiochus Soter, and named after his mother Apama. Strabo says that it lay at the mouth of the river Marsyas. Its site has been fixed at the modern Denair. Some ancient ruins are to be seen.</p><p><span id="note_36"><a href="#ref_36">36. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny commits an error here; Celænæ was a different place from Apamea, though close to it.</p><p><span id="note_37"><a href="#ref_37">37. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Meaning the "Fountains of the Pipe," and probably deriving its name from the legend here mentioned by Pliny, and in B. xvi. c. 44. Strabo describes the Marsyas and Mæander as rising, according to report, in one lake above Celænæ, which produced reeds adapted for making the mouth-pieces of musical instruments, but he gives no name to the lake. Hamilton found near Denair or Apamea, a lake nearly two miles in circumference, full of reeds and rushes, which he looks upon as the lake on the mountain Aulocrene, described by Pliny in the 31st Chapter of the present Book. His account however is very confused, as he mentions on different occasions a <hi rend="ital">region</hi> of Aulocrene, a <hi rend="ital">valley</hi> of Aulocrene, and a <hi rend="ital">mountain</hi> of Aulocrene.</p><p><span id="note_38"><a href="#ref_38">38. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">People of "the Mother City," said by Stephen of Byzantium to have received that name from Cybele, the <hi rend="ital">Mother</hi> of the Gods.</p><p><span id="note_39"><a href="#ref_39">39. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Nothing is known of the site of Dionysopolis. It is mentioned in a letter of Cicero's to his brother Quintus, in which he speaks of the people of this place as being very hostile to the latter.</p><p><span id="note_40"><a href="#ref_40">40. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The site of Euphorbium is denoted, according to Leake, by the modern Sandukli. It lay between Synnas and Apamea, and not improbably, like Eucarpia, received its name from the fertility of its territory.</p><p><span id="note_41"><a href="#ref_41">41. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The site of Acmona has been fixed at Ahatkoi, but it seems doubtful.</p><p><span id="note_42"><a href="#ref_42">42. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The site of Pelta is by D'Anville called Ris-Chak or Hou-Chak.</p><p><span id="note_43"><a href="#ref_43">43. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The people of Silbium or Silbia, near Metropolis.</p><p><span id="note_44"><a href="#ref_44">44. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Dorian settlements on the coast of Caria were so called.

The site of this famous city is occupied by the modern Boodroum, and its ruins are very extensive. It was famous as being the birth-place of the two historians Herodotus and Dionysius. It was the largest and best fortified city of Caria.</p><p><span id="note_48"><a href="#ref_48">48. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">According to Parisot the site of this place is now called Angeli and Karabaglas.</p><p><span id="note_49"><a href="#ref_49">49. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This place must not be confounded with Tehnessus or Telmissus in Lycia, which has been previously mentioned.
