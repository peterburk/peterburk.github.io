Cato<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> recommends that it should beplanted in a damp situation, the soil being first turned up witha double mattock, and a distance of three feet left between theyoung<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> layers; he says, too, that the wild asparagus<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> fromwhich the cultivated species is produced, may be planted together with it, as they agree particularly well together.</p><p>(37.) He says also that the willow may be planted in itsvicinity, than which there is no aquatic plant of more generalutility, although the poplar may be preferred for the trainingof the vine, and the support of the Cæcuban grape; although,too, the alder affords a more efficient protection by the hedgesit forms, and, planted in the very water, makes a rampartalong the banks in defence of the adjoining country againstthe violence of the rivers when they overflow; when cut down,too, this last tree is useful for the innumerable suckers whichit throws out.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">De Re Rust. c. 6.
