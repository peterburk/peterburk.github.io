ADULTERATIONS USED IN ALL SPICES AND AROMATICS; THE VARIOUSTESTS OF THEM AND THEIR RESPECTIVE VALUES.</head><p>In the vicinity, too, of India, is Bactriana, in which regionwe find bdellium,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> that is so highly esteemed. This tree is of ablack colour, and about the size of the olive; it has leaves likethose of the robur, and bears a fruit similar to that of the wildfig, and in nature resembling a kind of gum. This fruit isby some persons called brochon, by others malacha, and byothers, again, maldacon. When of a black colour, and rolledup in cakes, it bears the name of hadrobolon. This substanceought to be transparent and the colour of wax, odoriferous,unctuous when subjected to friction, and bitter to the taste,though without the slightest acidity. When used for sacredpurposes, it is steeped in wine, upon which it emits a stillmore powerful odour. The tree is a native of both India andArabia, as well as Media and Babylon; some persons give tothe bdellium that is imported by way of Media, the name ofperaticum.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> This last is remarkable for its brittleness, while,at the same time, it is harder and more bitter than the otherkinds; that of India, on the other hand, is moister, and gummy.This last sort is adulterated by means of almonds, while thevarious other kinds are falsified with the bark of scordastum,that being the name of a tree<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> the gum of which strongly resembles bdellium. These aduiterations, however, are to bedetected—and let it suffice to mention it here, in relation to allother perfumes as well—by the smell, the colour, the weight,the taste, and the action of fire. The bdellium of Bactrianais shining and dry, and covered with numerous white spotsresembling the finger-nails; besides which, it should be of acertain weight, heavier or lighter than which it ought not tobe. The price of bdellium, in its pure state, is three denariiper pound.<pb n="3117" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Fée remarks, that it is singular that a resinous gum, such as bdellium, should have been used in commerce for now two thousand years,and yet its origin remain unknown. Kæmpfer and Rumphus are ofopinion, that the tree which produces it is the one known to naturalists asthe Borassus flabelliformis of Linnæus, or the Lontarus of others. It isimported into Europe from Arabia and India, and is often found mixedwith gum Arabic.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot"><foreign lang="greek">Peratiko\n;</foreign> from <foreign lang="greek">per|ata\ gh=s</foreign> "the remotest parts of the earth,"from which it was brought.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The modern name of this tree is unknown.</p></body>
