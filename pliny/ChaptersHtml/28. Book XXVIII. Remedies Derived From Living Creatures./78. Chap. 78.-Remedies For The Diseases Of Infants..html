<div2 type="chapter" n="78" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 78.—REMEDIES FOR THE DISEASES OF INFANTS.</head><p>For infants there is nothing more useful than butter,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> eitherby itself or in combination with honey; for dentition moreparticularly, for soreness of the gums, and for ulcerations ofthe mouth. A wolf's tooth, attached to the body, preventsinfants from being startled, and acts as a preservative againstthe maladies attendant upon dentition; an effect equallyproduced by making use of a wolf's skin. The larger teeth,also, of a wolf, attached to a horse's neck, will render himproof against all weariness, it is said. A hare's rennet, appliedto the breasts of the nurse, effectually prevents diarrhœa inthe infant suckled by her. An ass's liver, mixed with a littlepanax, and dropped into the mouth of an infant, will preserveit from epilepsy and other diseases to which infants are liable;this, however, must be done for forty days, they say. An ass'sskin, too, thrown over infants, renders them insensible to fear.The first teeth shed by a horse, attached as an amulet to infants,facilitate dentition, and are better still, when not allowed totouch the ground. For pains in the spleen, an ox's milt is administered in honey, and applied topically; and for runningulcers it is used as an application, with honey. A calf's milt,boiled in wine, is beaten up, and applied to incipient ulcersof the mouth.</p><p>The magicians take the brains of a she-goat, and, after passingthem through a gold ring, drop them into the mouth of the infant before it takes the breast, as a preservative against epilepsyand other infantile diseases. Goats' dung, attached to infants in a piece of cloth, prevents them from being restless, female infants in particular. By rubbing the gums of<pb n="5365" />infants with goats' milk or hare's brains, dentition is greatlyfacilitated.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There is probably some truth in these statements as to the utility ofbutter and honey for infants.</p></body>
