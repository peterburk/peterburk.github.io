<div2 type="chapter" n="6" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 6. (8.)ÑMONSTROUS BIRTHS.</head><p>It is contrary to nature for children to come into the worldwith the feet first, for which reason such children are calledAgripp¾, meaning that they are born with difficulty.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> Inthis manner, M. Agrippa<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> is said to have been born; the<pb n="2143" />only instance, almost, of good fortune, out of the number ofall those who have come into the world under these circumstances. And yet, even he may be considered to have paidthe penalty of the unfavourable omen produced by the unnatural mode of his birth, in the unfortunate weakness of hislegs, the misfortunes of his youth, a life spent in the very midstof arms and slaughter, and ever exposed to the approaches ofdeath; in his children, too, who have all proved a very curse tothe earth, and more especially, the two Agrippinas, who were themothers respectively of Caius and of Domitius Nero,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> so manyfirebrands hurled among the human race. In addition to allthis, we may add the shortness of his life, he being cut offin his fifty-first year, the distress which he experienced fromthe adulteries of his wife,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and the grievous tyranny to whichhe was subjected by his father-in-law. Agrippina, too, themother of Nero, who was lately Emperor, and who provedhimself, throughout the whole of his reign, the enemy of thehuman race, has left it recorded in writing, that he was bornwith his feet first. It is in the due order of nature that manshould enter the world with the head first, and be carried tothe tomb in a contrary fashion.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This explanation of the name is given by Aulus Gellius, B. xvi. c. 6.ÑB. It is very doubtful what are the roots from which it is formed;though Pliny evidently thinks that the word is only a corruption of theLatin "¾gre partus," "born with difficulty;" a notion savouring of absurdity.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">M. Vipsanius Agrippa, the son-in-law of Augustus, having marriedhis dissolute daughter, Julia. He was the son of Lucius Agrippa, and wasdescended from a very obscure family. He divorced his wife Marcella, tomarry Julia, the widow of Marcellus, and the daughter of Augustus, byhis third wife, Scribonia.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Agrippina, the daughter of Agrippa and Julia, was the mother ofthe Emperor Caligula; and of a second Agrippina, who became themother of Nero, by whose order she was put to death.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Julia, the daughter of Augustus, so notorious for her depravity, who,as already stated, was the wife of Agrippa.ÑB.
