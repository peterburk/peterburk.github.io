(36.)—AN ANIMAL FOUND IN FIRE—-THE PYRALLISOR PYRAUSTA.</head><p>That element, also, which is so destructive to matter, produces certain animals; for in the copper-smelting furnaces ofCyprus, in the very midst of the fire, there is to be seen flyingabout a four-footed animal with wings, the size of a large fly:this creature is called the " pyrallis," and by some the " pyrausta." So long as it remains in the fire it will live, but if itcomes out and flies a little distance from it, it will instantlydie.</p></div2></body>
