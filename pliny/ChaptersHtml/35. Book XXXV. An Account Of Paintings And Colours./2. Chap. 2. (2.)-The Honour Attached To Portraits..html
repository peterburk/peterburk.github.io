<div2 type="chapter" n="2" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 2. (2.)—THE HONOUR ATTACHED TO PORTRAITS.</head><p>Correct portraits of individuals were formerly transmitted tofuture ages by painting; but this has now completely fallen intodesuetude. Brazen shields are now set up, and silver faces, withonly some obscure traces of the countenance:<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> the very heads,too, of statues are changed,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> a thing that has given rise beforenow to many a current sarcastic line; so true it is that peopleprefer showing off the valuable material, to having a faithfullikeness. And yet, at the same time, we tapestry the walls ofour galleries with old pictures, and we prize the portraits ofstrangers; while as to those made in honour of ourselves, weesteem them only for the value of the material, for some heir tobreak up and melt, and so forestall the noose and slip-knot ofthe thief.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> Thus it is that we possess the portraits of noliving individuals, and leave behind us the pictures of ourwealth, not of our persons.</p><p>And yet the very same persons adorn the palæstra and theanointing-room<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> with portraits of athletes, and both hangup in their chamber and carry about them a likeness ofEpicurus.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> On the twentieth day of each moon they celebratehis birthday<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> by a sacrifice, and keep his festival.known as the "Icas,"<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> every month: and these too, people who<pb n="6225" />wish to live without being known!<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> So it is, most assuredly,our indolence has lost sight of the arts, and since our mindsare destitute of any characteristic features, those of our bodiesare neglected also.</p><p>But on the contrary, in the days of our ancestors, it wasthese that were to be seen in their halls, and not statues madeby foreign artists, or works in bronze or marble: portraitsmodelled in wax<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> were arranged, each in its separate niche,to be always in readiness to accompany the funeral processionsof the family;<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> occasions on which every member of thefamily that had ever existed was always present. The pedigree,too, of the individual was traced in lines upon each ofthese coloured portraits. Their muniment-rooms,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> too, werefilled with archives and memoirs, stating what each had donewhen holding the magistracy. On the outside, again, of theirhouses, and around the thresholds of their doors, were placedother statues of those mighty spirits, in the spoils of the enemythere affixed, memorials which a purchaser even was notallowed to displace; so that the very house continued totriumph even after it had changed its master. A powerfulstimulus to emulation this, when the walls each day reproachedan unwarlike owner for having thus intruded uponthe triumphs of another! There is still extant an address bythe orator Messala, full of indignation, in which he forbidsthat there should be inserted among the images of his familyany of those of the stranger race of the Lævini.<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> It was thesame feeling, too, that extorted from old Messala those compilationsof his "On the Families of Rome;" when, uponpassing through the hall of Scipio Pomponianus,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> he observedthat, in consequence of a testamentary adoption, the Salvittos<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span><pb n="6226" />—for that had been their surname—to the disgrace of theAfricani, had surreptitiously contrived to assume the name ofthe Scipios. But the Messalas must pardon me if I remark,that to lay a claim, though an untruthful one, to the statuesof illustrious men, shows some love for their virtues, and ismuch more honourable than to have such a character as tomerit that no one should wish to claim them.</p><p>There is a new invention too, which we must not omit tonotice. Not only do we consecrate in our libraries, in goldor silver, or at all events, in bronze, those whose immortalspirits hold converse with us in those places, but we even goso far as to reproduce the ideal of features, all remembrance ofwhich has ceased to exist; and our regrets give existence tolikenesses that have not been transmitted to us, as in the caseof Homer, for example.<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> And indeed, it is my opinion, thatnothing can be a greater proof of having achieved success inlife, than a lasting desire on the part of one's fellow-men, toknow what one's features were. This practice of groupingportraits was first introduced at Rome by Asinius Pollio,who was also the first to establish a public library, and somake the works of genius the property of the public.Whether the kings of Alexandria and of Pergamus, who hadso energetically rivalled each other in forming libraries, hadpreviously introduced this practice, I cannot so easily say.</p><p>That a strong passion for portraits formerly existed, isattested both by Atticus, the friend of Cicero, who wrote awork on this subject,<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> and by M. Varro, who conceived thevery liberal idea of inserting, by some means<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> or other, in hisnumerous volumes, the portraits of seven hundred individuals;as he could not bear the idea that all traces of their featuresshould be lost, or that the lapse of centuries should get the<pb n="6227" />better of mankind. Thus was he the inventor of a benefit tohis fellow-men, that might have been envied by the godsthemselves; for not only did he confer upon them immortality,but he transmitted them, too, to all parts of the earth; so thateverywhere it might be possible for them to be present, andfor each to occupy his niche. This service, too, Varro conferred upon persons who were no members of his own family.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Surdo figurarum discrimine."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We are informed by Suetonius, that this practice existed in the timeof Tiberius.—B.
