The various kinds of tapewormn<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> areexpelled by taking the ashes of deer's horns in drink. The bones<pb n="5349" />which we have spoken<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> of as being found in the excrementsof the wolf, worn attached to the arm, are curative of diseasesof the colon, provided they have not been allowed to touch theground. Polea, too, a substance already mentioned,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> is remarkably useful for this purpose, boiled in grape juice:<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> thesame too with swine's dung, powdered and mixed with cummin, in a decoction of rue. The antler of a young stag,reduced to ashes and taken in wine, mixed with African snails,crushed with the shells on, is considered a very, useful remedy.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He uses "t¾nia" probably, as a general name for intestinal worms.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In c. 49 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In c. 57 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Sapa."
