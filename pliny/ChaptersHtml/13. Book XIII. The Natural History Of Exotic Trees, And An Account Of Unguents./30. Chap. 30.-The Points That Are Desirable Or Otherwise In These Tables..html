<div2 type="chapter" n="30" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 30.—THE POINTS THAT ARE DESIRABLE OR OTHERWISE INTHESE TABLES.</head><p>The principal merit of these tables is to have veins<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> arranged<pb n="3196" />in waving lines, or else forming spirals like so many littlewhirlpools. In the former arrangement the lines run in anoblong direction, for which reason these are called "tiger"<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>tables; while in the latter the marks are circling and spiral,and hence they are styled "panther"<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> tables. There aresome tables also with wavy, undulating marks, and which aremore particularly esteemed if these resemble the eyes on apeacock's tail. Next in esteem to these last, as well as thosepreviously mentioned, is the veined wood,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> covered, as it were,with dense masses of grain, for which reason these tables havereceived the name of "apiatæ."<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> But the colour of the woodis the quality that is held in the highest esteem of all: thatof wine mixed with honey<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> being the most prized, the veins beingpeculiarly refulgent. Next to the colour, it is the size that isprized; at the present day whole trunks are greatly admired,and sometimes several are united in a single table.</p><p>The peculiar defects in these kinds of tables are woodiness,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>such being the name given to the table when the wood is dull,common-looking, indistinct, or else has mere simple marksupon it, resembling the leaves of the plane-tree; also, whenit resembles the veins of the holm-oak or the colour of thattree; and, a fault to which it is peculiarly liable from theeffect of heat or wind, when it has flaws in it or hair-like linesresembling flaws; when it has a black mark, too, runningthrough it resembling a murena in appearance, various streaksthat look like crow scratches, or knots like poppy heads, with acolour all over nearly approaching to black, or blotches of asickly hue. The barbarous tribes bury this wood in theground while green, first giving it a coating of wax. Whenit comes into the workmen's hands, they put it for seven daysbeneath a heap of corn, and then take it out for as many<pb n="3197" />more: it is quite surprising how greatly it loses in weight bythis process. Shipwrecks have recently taught us also that thiswood is dried by the action of sea-water, and that it therebyacquires a hardness<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> and a degree of density which render itproof against corruption no other method is equally sure toproduce these results. These tables are kept best, and shinewith the greatest lustre, when rubbed with the dry hand,more particularly just after bathing. As if this wood hadbeen created for the behoof of wine, it receives no injuryfrom it.</p><p>(16.) As this tree is one among the elements of more civilized life, I think that it is as well on the present occasion todwell a little further upon it. It was known to Homer even,and in the Greek it is known by the name of "thyon,"<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> orsometimes "thya." He says that the wood of this tree wasamong the unguents that were burnt for their pleasant odourby Circe,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> whom he would represent as being a goddess; acircumstance which shows the great mistake committed bythose who suppose that perfumes are meant under that name,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>seeing that in the very same line he says that cedar and larchwere burnt along with this wood, a thing that clearly provesthat it is only of different trees that he is speaking. Theophrastus, an author who wrote in the age succeeding that ofAlexander the Great, and about the year of the City of Rome440, has awarded a very high rank to this tree, stating that itis related that the raftering of the ancient temples used to bemade of this wood, and that the timber, when employed inroofs, will last for ever, so to say, being proof against all decay,—quite incorruptible, in fact. He also says that there isnothing more full of wavy veins<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> than the root of this tree, andthat there is no workmanship in existence more precious thanthat made of this material. The finest kind of citrus grows,he says, in the vicinity of the Temple of Jupiter Hammon;he states also that it is produced in the lower part of Cyre-naica. He has made no mention, however, of the tables thatare made of it; indeed, we have no more ancient accounts of<pb n="3198" />them than those of the time of Cicero, from which it wouldappear that they are a comparatively recent invention.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">These veins were nothing in reality but the lines of the layers orstrata lignea, running perpendicularly in the trunk, and the number ofwhich denotes the age of the tree.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Tigrinæ."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Pantherinæ."
