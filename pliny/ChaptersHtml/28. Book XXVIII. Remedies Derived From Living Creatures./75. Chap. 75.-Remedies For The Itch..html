Butter, too, is verygood; as also in the case of beasts of burden, if applied withwarmed resin: bull glue is also used, melted in vinegar, andincorporated with lime; or goat's gall, mixed with calcinedalum. The eruption called "boa,"<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> is treated with cow-dung,a fact to which it is indebted for its name. The itch in dogsis cured by an application of fresh cows' blood, which, whenquite dry, is renewed a second time, and is rubbed off the nextday with strong lie-ashes.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxiv. c. 35.</p></body>
