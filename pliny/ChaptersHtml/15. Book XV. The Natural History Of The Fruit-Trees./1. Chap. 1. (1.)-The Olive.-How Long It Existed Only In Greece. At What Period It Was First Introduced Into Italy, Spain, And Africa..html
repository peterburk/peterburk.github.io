(1.)—THE OLIVE.—HOW LONG IT EXISTED ONLY IN GREECE.AT WHAT PERIOD IT WAS FIRST INTRODUCED INTO ITALY, SPAIN,AND AFRICA.</head><p>THEOPHRASTUS,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> one of the most famous among the Greekwriters, who flourished about the year 440 of the City ofRome, has asserted that the olive<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> does not grow at a distanceof more than forty<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> miles from the sea. Fenestella tells usthat in the year of Rome 173, being the reign of TarquiniusPriscus, it did not exist in Italy, Spain, or Africa;<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> whereasat the present day it has crossed the Alps even, and has beenintroduced into the two provinces of Gaul and the middle ofSpain. In the year of Rome 505, Appius Claudius, grandsonof Appius Claudius Cæcus, and L. Junius being consuls, twelvepounds of oil sold for an as; and at a later period, in the year680, M. Seius, son of Lucius, the curule ædile, regulated theprice of olive oil at Rome, at the rate of ten pounds for the as,for the whole year. A person will be the less surprised atthis, when he learns that twenty-two years after, in the thirdconsulship of Cn. Pompeius, Italy was able to export olive oilto the provinces.</p><p>Hesiod,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> who looked upon an acquaintance with agriculture<pb n="3278" />as conducive in the very highest degree to the comforts of life,has declared that there was no one who had ever gathered fruitfrom the olive-tree that had been sown by his own hands, soslow was it in reaching maturity in those times; whereas, nowat the present day, it is sown in nurseries even, and if transplanted will bear fruit the following year.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hist.

There is little doubt that longbefore the period mentioned by Pliny, it was grown in Africa by the Car-thaginians, and in the South of Gaul, at the colony of Massilia.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This work of Hesiod is no longer in existence; but the assertion isexaggerated, even if he alludes to the growth of the tree from seed. Feeremarks that a man who has sown the olive at twenty, may gather excellent fruit before he arrives at old age. It is more generally propagatedby slips or sets. If the trunk is destroyed by accident, the roots will throwout fresh suckers.</p></body>
