The Greeks call thisred earth "miltos," and give to minium the name of "cinnabaris,"and hence the error<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> caused by the two meanings of<pb n="6121" />the same word; this being properly the name given to thethick matter which issues from the dragon when crushed beneaththe weight of the dying elephant, mixed with the bloodof either animal, as already described.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> Indeed this last is theonly colour that in painting gives a proper representation ofblood. This cinnabaris, too, is extremely useful as an ingredientin antidotes and various medicaments. But, by Hercules !our physicians, because minium also has the name of"cinnabaris," use it as a substitute for the other, and so employa poison, as we shall shortly<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> show it to be.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The same as the miltos mentioned below, "miltos" being the wordused by Homer, II. II. 637. This substance is totally different from theminium of the preceding Chapters, and from that mentioned in c. 40. Itis our red ochre, peroxide of iron, mixed in a greater or less degree withargillaceous earth.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxix. c. 8; where he speaks of the mistake made by the physiciansin giving mineral vermilion or minium to their patients instead of Indian cinnabar. The latter substance is probably identical with thatwhich is now used for varnishes, being imported from India, and stillknown as " dragons' blood," the resin of the Ptero-carpus draco, or Calamuspalm.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. viii. c. 12.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In Chapter 41.</p></body>
