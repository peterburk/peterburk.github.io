Although I am quite convinced of the utter futility of these remarks, and am of opinion that they ought not to be publishedwithout hesitation, for fear lest each person might be anxiouslylooking out for these prognostics in his own person, I shall stillmake some slight mention of the subject, seeing that so learneda man as Aristotle did not treat it with contempt. He has setdown the following as indications of a short life—few teeth,very long fingers, a leaden colour, and numerous broken linesin the palm of the hand. On the other hand, he looks upon thefollowing as prognostics of a long life—stooping in the shoulders, one or two long unbroken lines in the hand, a greater num-ber than two-and-thirty teeth, and large ears. He does not, Iimagine, require that all these symptoms should unite in oneperson, but looks upon them as individually significant: in myopinion, however, they are utterly frivolous, all of them, although they obtain currency among the vulgar. Our own writer,Trogus, has in a similar manner set down the physiognomy asindicative of the moral disposition; one of the very gravest ofthe Roman authors, whose own<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> words I will here subjoin:—</p><p>"Where the forehead is broad, it is significant of a dull andsluggish understanding beneath; and where it is small, it in-dicates an unsteady disposition. A rounded forehead denotesan irascible temper, it seeming as though the swelling angerhad left its traces there. Where the eye-brows are extendedin one straight line, they denote effeminacy in the owner, andwhen they are bent downwards towards the nose, an austeredisposition. On the other hand, when the eye-brows are benttowards the temples, they are indicative of a sarcastic disposition; but when they lie very low, they denote malice andenvy. Long eyes are significant of a spiteful, malicious natureand where the corners of the eyes next the nose are fleshy, itis a sign also of a wicked disposition. If the white of the eyeis large, it bears tokens of impudence, while those who areincessantly closing the eyelids are inconstant.
