(3.)ÑHOW THE CITRON IS PLANTED.</head><p>The cherry and the peach, and all those trees which haveeither Greek or foreign names, are exotics: those, however, of<pb n="3107" />this number, which have begun to be naturalized among us,will be treated of when I come to speak of the fruit-trees ingeneral. For the present, I shall only make mention of thereally exotic trees, beginning with the one that is applied tothe most salutary uses. The citron tree, called the Assyrian,and by some the Median apple, is an antidote against poisons.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>The leaf is similar to that of the arbute, except that it hassmall prickles<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> running across it. As to the fruit, it is nevereaten,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> but it is remarkable for its extremely powerful smell,which is the case, also, with the leaves; indeed, the odour isso strong, that it will penetrate clothes, when they are onceimpregnated with it, and hence it is very useful in repellingthe attacks of noxious insects. The tree bears fruit at allseasons of the year; while some is falling off, other fruit isripening, and other, again, just bursting into birth. Variousnations have attempted to naturalize this tree among them, forthe sake of its medical properties, by planting it in pots ofclay, with holes drilled in them, for the purpose of introducingthe air to the roots; and I would here remark, once for all,that it is as well to remember that the best plan is to pack allslips of trees that have to be carried to any distance, as closetogether as they can possibly be placed. It has been found,however, that this tree will grow nowhere<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> except inMedia or Persia. It is this fruit, the pips of which, as wehave already mentioned,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> the Parthian grandees employ inseasoning their ragouts, as being peculiarly conducive to thesweetening of the breath. We find no other tree very highlycommended that is produced in Media.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxiii. c. <hi rend="ital">55.</hi> FŽe remarks, that the ancients confounded thecitron with the orange-tree.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">FŽe remarks, that this is not the case.
