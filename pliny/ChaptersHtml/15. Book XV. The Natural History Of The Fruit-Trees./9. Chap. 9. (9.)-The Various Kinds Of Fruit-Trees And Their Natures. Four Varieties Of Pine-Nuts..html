<div2 type="chapter" n="9" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 9. (9.)ÑTHE VARIOUS KINDS OF FRUIT-TREES AND THEIRNATURES. FOUR VARIETIES OF PINE-NUTS.</head><p>The other fruits found on trees can hardly be enumerated,from their diversity in shape and figure, without reference totheir different flavours and juices, which have again beenmodified by repeated combinations and graftings.</p><p>(10.) The largest fruit, and, indeed, the one that hangs atthe greatest height, is the pine-nut. It contains within anumber of small kernels, enclosed in arched beds, and coveredwith a coat of their own of rusty iron-colour; Nature thus manifesting a marvellous degree of care in providing its seeds witha soft receptacle. Another variety of this nut is the terentina,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> the shell of which may be broken with the fingers; andhence it becomes a prey to the birds while still on the tree. Athird, again, is known as the "sappinia,"<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> being the produceof the cultivated pitch-tree: the kernels are enclosed in askin more than a shell, which is so remarkably soft that it iseaten together with the fruit. A fourth variety is that knownas the "pityis;" it is the produce of the pinaster,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and isremarkable as a good specific for coughs. The kernels aresometimes boiled in honey<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> among the Taurini, who then callthem "aquiceli." The conquerors at the Isthmian games arecrowned with a wreath of pine-leaves.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Pinus cembro, probably, of Linn¾us.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xvi. c. 23.
