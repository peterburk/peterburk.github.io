<div2 type="chapter" n="15" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 15.—COUGH.</head><p>Of all diseases of the chest, cough is the one that is themost oppressive. For the cure of this malady, root of panaces<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> in sweet wine is used, and in cases where it is attendedwith spitting of blood, juice of henbane. Henbane, too, used asa fumigation, is good for cough; and the same with scordotis,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>mixed with nasturtium and dry resin, beaten up with honey:employed by itself also, scordotis facilitates expectoration, aproperty which is equally possessed by the greater centaury,even where the patient is troubled with spitting of blood; forwhich last juice of plantago is very beneficial. Betony, takenin doses of three oboli in water, is useful for purulent orbloody expectorations: root also of persolata,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> in doses ofone drachma, taken with eleven pine-nuts; and juice of peu-cedanum.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span></p><p>For pains in the chest, acoron<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> is remarkably useful; henceit is that it is so much used an ingredient in antidotes. Forcough, daucus<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> and the plant scythice <span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> are much employed,this last being good, in fact, for all affections of the chest,coughs, and purulent expectorations, taken in doses of threeoboli, with the same proportion of raisin wine. The verbascum<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> too, with a flower like gold, is similarly employed.</p><p>(6.) This last-named plant is so remarkably energetic, thatan infusion of it, administered in their drink, will relievebeasts of burden, not only when troubled with cough, but whenbroken-winded even—a property which I find attributed togentian also. Root of cacalia<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> chewed, or steeped in wine, isgood for cough as well as all affections of the throat. Fivesprigs of hyssop, with two of rue and three figs, act detergentlyupon the thoracic organs and allay cough,<pb n="5164" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxv. c. 11.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxv. c. 27.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxv. c. 66.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxv. c. 70.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxv. c. 100.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxv. c. 64.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxii. c. 11, and B. xxv. c. 43.
