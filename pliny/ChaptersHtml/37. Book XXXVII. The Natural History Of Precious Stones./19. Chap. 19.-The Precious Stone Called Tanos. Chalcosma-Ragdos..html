CHALCOSMA-RAGDOS.</head><p>Among the smaragdi is also included the precious stoneknown as "tanos."<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> It comes from Persia, and is of anunsightly green, and of a soiled colour within. There is thechalcosmaragdos<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> also, a native of Cyprus, the face of which ismottled with coppery veins. Theophrastus relates that hehad found it stated in the Egyptian histories, that a king ofBabylon once sent to the king of Egypt a smaragdus<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> four<pb n="6414" />cubits in length by three in breadth. He informs us, also, thatin a temple of Jupiter in Egypt there was an obelisk made offour smaragdi, forty cubits in length, and four in breadth atone extremity, and two at the other. He says, too, that atthe period at which he wrote, there was in the Temple of Herculesat Tyrus a large column made of a single smaragdus;<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>though very possibly it might only be pseudo-smaragdus, akind of stone not uncommonly found in Cyprus, where a blockhad been discovered, composed, one half of smaragdus, andone half of jasper,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> and the liquid in which had not as yetbeen entirely transformed. Apion, surnamed "Plistonices,"<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>has left a very recent statement, that there was still in existence,in his time, in the Labyrinth of Egypt, a colossal statueof Serapis made of a single smaragdus, nine cubits in height.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Supposed by Ajasson to be the Euclase, a brittle green stone, composedof silica, alumina, and glucina. Haüy gave it this name from theGreek words <foreign lang="greek">eu</foreign>, "easily," and <foreign lang="greek">kla/w</foreign>, "to break." According to Dana,however, Euclase was first brought from Peru: if such is the fact, we must,perhaps, look for its identification in Epidote, a green silicate of alumina.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Brazen smaragdus." It was probably Dioptase, combined with copperPyrites.
