<div2 type="chapter" n="43" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 43.—THE NIGHTINGALE.</head><p>The song of the nightingale is to be heard, without intermission, for fifteen days and nights, continuously,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> when thefoliage is thickening, as it bursts from the bud; a bird whichdeserves our admiration in no slight degree. First of all,what a powerful voice in so small a body! its note, how long,and how well sustained! And then, too, it is the only birdthe notes of which are modulated in accordance with the strictrules of musical science.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> At one moment, as it sustains its<pb n="2510" />breath, it will prolong its note, and then at another, will varyit with different inflexions; then, again, it will break intodistinct chirrups, or pour forth an endless series of roulades.Then it will warble to itself, while taking breath, or else disguise its voice in an instant; while sometimes, again, it willtwitter to itself, now with a full note, now with a grave, nowagain sharp, now with a broken note, and now with a prolongedone. Sometimes, again, when it thinks fit, it will breakout into quavers, and will run through, in succession, alto,tenor, and bass: in a word, in so tiny a throat is to be foundall the melody that the ingenuity of man has ever discoveredthrough the medium of the invention of the most exquisiteflute: so much so, that there can be no doubt it was an infallible presage of his future sweetness as a poet, when one ofthese creatures perched and sang on the infant lips of thepoet Stesichorus.</p><p>That there may remain no doubt that there is a certaindegree of art in its performances, we may here remark thatevery bird has a number of notes peculiar to itself; for theydo not, all of them, have the same, but each, certain melodiesof its own. They vie with one another, and the spiritwith which they contend is evident to all. The one thatis vanquished, often dies in the contest, and will rather yieldits life than its song. The younger birds are listening in themeantime, and receive the lesson in song from which theyare to profit. The learner hearkens with the greatest attention,and repeats what it has heard, and then they are silent byturns; this is understood to be the correction of an error on thepart of the scholar, and a sort of reproof, as it were, on thepart of the teacher. Hence it is that nightingales fetch ashigh a price as slaves, and, indeed, sometimes more than usedformerly to be paid for a man in a suit of armour.</p><p>I know that on one occasion six thousand sesterces<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> werepaid for a nightingale, a white one it is true, a thing that ishardly ever to be seen, to be made a present of to Agrippina, thewife of the Emperor Claudius. A nightingale has been oftenseen that will sing at command, and take alternate parts withthe music that accompanies it; men, too, have been found whocould imitate its note with such exactness, that it would beimpossible to tell the difference, by merely putting water in a<pb n="2511" />reed held crosswise, and then blowing into it, a languette beingfirst inserted, for the purpose of breaking the sound and rendering it more shrill.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> But these modulations, so clever and soartistic, begin gradually to cease at the end of the fifteen days;not that you can say, however, that the bird is either fatiguedor tired of singing; but, as the heat increases, its voice becomesaltogether changed, and possesses no longer either modulation or variety of note. Its colour, too, becomes changed, andat last, throughout the winter, it totally disappears. The tongueof the nightingale is not pointed at the tip, as in other birds.It lays at the beginning of the spring, six eggs at the most.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It was the nightingale that was said to be "Vox et præterea nihil;""A voice, and nothing else."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">As there may be different opinions on the meaning of the variousparts of this passage, it is as well to transcribe it for the benefit of thereader, the more especially as, contrary to his usual practice, Pliny ishere in a particularly discursive mood. "Nunc continuo spiritu trahitur inlongum, nunc variatur inflexo, nunc distinguitur conciso, copulatur intorto,promittitur revocato, infuscatur ex inopinato, interdum et secum ipsemurmurat, plenus, gravis, acutus, creber, extentus; ubi visum est, vibrans,summus, medius, imus."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">1227 francs, Ajasson says.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Something very similar to this, we often see practised by the waterwarblers in our streets.</p></body>
