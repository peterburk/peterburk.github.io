(51.)—OF THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF LIGHTNING<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>AND THEIR WONDERFUL EFFECTS.</head><p>We have accounts of many different kinds of thunder-storms.Those which are dry do not burn objects, but dissipate them;while those which are moist do not burn, but blacken them.There is a third kind, which is called bright lightning<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>, of avery wonderful nature, by which casks are emptied, withoutthe vessels themselves being injured, or there being any othertrace left of their operation<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>. Gold, copper, and silver aremelted, while the bags which contain them are not in theleast burned, nor even the wax seal much defaced. Marcia,a lady of high rank at Rome, was struck while pregnant;the fœtus was destroyed, while she herself survived without<pb n="1082" />suffering any injury<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>. Among the prognostics which tookplace at the time of Catiline's conspiracy, M. Herennius, amagistrate of the borough of Pompeii, was struck by lightning when the sky was without clouds<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"fulgur." The account of the different kinds of thunder seems tobe principally taken from Aristotle; Meteor. iii. 1. Some of thephænomena mentioned below, which would naturally appear to theancientsthe most remarkable, are easily explained by a reference to their electricalorigin.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"quod clarum vocant."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This account seems to be taken from Aristotle, Meteor. iii 1. p. 574;see also Seneca, Nat.

The title of "princeps Romanarum,"which is applied to Marcia, has given rise to some discussion among thecommentators, for which see the remarks of Hardouin and Alexandre, inLemaire, i. 348.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Sometimes a partial thunder-cloud is formed, while the atmospheregenerally is perfectly clear, or, as Hardouin suggests, the effect mighthave been produced by a volcanic eruption.
