<div2 type="chapter" n="6" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 6.ÑMANURE.</head><p>There are various kinds of manure, the use of which is ofvery ancient date. In the times of Homer<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> even, the agedking is represented as thus enriching the land by the labour ofhis own hands. Tradition reports that King Augeas was thefirst in Greece to make use of it, and that Hercules introducedthe practice into Italy; which country has, however, immortalized the name of its king, Stercutus,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> the son of Faunus,as claiming the honour of this invention. M. Varro<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> assignsthe first rank for excellence to the dung of thrushes kept inaviaries, and lauds it as being not only good for land, butexcellent food for oxen and swine as well; indeed, he goes sofar as to assert that there is no food that they will grow fat uponmore speedily. We really have some reason to augur well ofthe manners of the present day, if it is true that in the daysof our ancestors there were aviaries of such vast extent as tobe able to furnish manure for the fields.<pb n="3457" /></p><p>Columella<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> gives the second rank to pigeon manure,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> andthe next to that of the poultry-yard; but he condemns thatof the aquatic birds. Some authors, again, are agreed in regarding the residue of the human food<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> as the very best ofall manures; while others would only employ the superfluousportion of our drink,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> mixing with it the hair that is to befound in the curriers' workshops. Some, however, are foremploying this liquid by itself, though they would mix waterwith it once more, and in larger quantities even than whenoriginally mixed with the wine at our repasts; there being adouble share of noxious qualities to correct, not only thoseoriginally belonging to the wine,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> but those imparted to itby the human body as well. Such are the various methodsby which we vie with each other in imparting nutriment tothe earth even.</p><p>Next to the manures above mentioned, the dung of swine ishighly esteemed, Columella being the only writer that condemns it. Some, again, speak highly of the dung of allquadrupeds that have been fed on cytisus, while there areothers who prefer that of pigeons. Next to these is thedung of goats, and then of sheep; after which comes that ofoxen, and, last of all, of the beasts of burden. Such werethe distinctions that were established between the various manures among the ancients, such the precepts that they have leftus, and these I have here set forth as being not the mere subtleinventions of genius, but because their utility has been provedin the course of a long series of years. In some of the provinces, too, which abound more particularly in cattle, by rea-<pb n="3458" />son of their prolific soil, we have seen the manure passedthrough a sieve like so much flour, and perfectly devoid,through lapse of time,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> of all bad smell or repulsive look,being changed in its appearance to something rather agreeablethan otherwise. In more recent times it has been found thatthe olive thrives more particularly in soil that has been manured with the ashes<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> of the lime-kiln. To the ancient rulesVarro<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> has added, that corn land should be manured with horsedung, that being the lightest manure of all, while meadowland, he says, thrives better with a manure of a more heavynature, and supplied by beasts that have been fed upon barley;this last tending more particularly to the better growth ofgrass.<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> Some persons, indeed, prefer the dung of the beastsof burden to that of oxen even, the manure of the sheep tothat of the goat, and the manure of the ass to all others, thereason being that that animal masticates the most slowly ofthem all. Experience, however, has pronounced against thesedicta of Varro and Columella; but it is universally agreed byall writers that there is nothing more beneficial than to turn<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>up a crop of lupines, before they have podded, with either theplough or the fork, or else to cut them and bury them inheaps at the roots of trees and vines. It is thought, also,that in places where no cattle are kept, it is advantageous tomanure the earth with stubble or even fern. " You can makemanure," Cato<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> says, "of litter, or else of lupines, straw,beanstalks, or the leaves of the holm-oak and quercus. Pullup the wallwort from among the crops of corn, as also thehemlock that grows there, together with the thick grass andsedge that you find growing about the willow-plots; of all this,mixed with rotten leaves,<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> you may make a litter for sheep and<pb n="3459" />oxen. If a vine should happen to be but poor and meagre,prune<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> the shoots of it, and plough them in round about it."The same author says, also,<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> "When you are going to sow cornin a field, fold your sheep<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> there first."</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Odyssey xxiv. 225.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From "stercus," "dang."

It is difficult to say whatcould have been the noxious qualities imparted by wine to urine as a ma-nure, and Pliny probably would have been somewhat at a loss to explainhis meaning.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In lapse of time, if exposed to the air, it is reduced to the state ofhumus or mould.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Consisting of lime mixed with vegetable ashes.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">De Re Rust. i. 38.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Herbas."
