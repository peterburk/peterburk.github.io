<div2 type="chapter" n="18" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 18.ÑTHE MOST CELEBRATED COLOSSAL STATUES IN THECITY.</head><p>As to boldness of design, the examples are innumerable;for we see designed, statues of enormous bulk, known ascolossal statues and equal to towers in size. Such, forinstance, is the Apollo in the Capitol, which was brought byM. Lucullus from Apollonia, a city of Pontus,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> thirty cubitsin height, and which cost five hundred talents: such, too, isthe statue of Jupiter, in the Campus Martius, dedicated bythe late Emperor Claudius, but which appears small in comparisonfrom its vicinity to the Theatre of Pompeius: and suchis that at Tarentum, forty cubits in height, and the work ofLysippus.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> It is a remarkable circumstance in this statue,that though, as it is stated, it is so nicely balanced as to bemoveable by the hand, it has never been thrown down by atempest. This indeed, the artist, it is said, has guardedagainst, by a column erected at a short distance from it,upon the side on which the violence of the wind requiredto be broken. On account, therefore, of its magnitude, andthe great difficulty of moving it, Fabius Verrucosus<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> did not<pb n="6165" />touch it, when he transferred the Hercules from that place tothe Capitol, where it now stands.</p><p>But that which is by far the most worthy of our admiration,is the colossal statue of the Sun, which stood formerly atRhodes, and was the work of Chares the Lindian, a pupilof the above-named Lysippus;<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> no less than seventy cubits inheight. This statue fifty-six years after it was erected, wasthrown down by an earthquake; but even as it lies, it excitesour wonder and admiration.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> Few men can clasp the thumbin their arms, and its fingers are larger than most statues.Where the limbs are broken asunder, vast caverns are seenyawning in the interior. Within it, too, are to be seen largemasses of rock, by the weight of which the artist steadied itwhile erecting it. It is said that it was twelve years beforethis statue was completed, and that three hundred talents wereexpended upon it; a sum raised from the engines of warfarewhich had been abandoned by King Demetrius,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> when tiredof the long-protracted siege of Rhodes. In the same citythere are other colossal statues, one hundred in number; butthough smaller than the one already mentioned, wherevererected, they would, any one of them, have ennobled the place.In addition to these, there are five colossal statues of the gods,which were made by Bryaxis.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span></p><p>Colossal statues used also to be made in Italy. At all events,we see the Tuscan Apollo, in the library of the Temple ofAugustus,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> fifty feet in height from the toe; and it is a questionwhether it is more remarkable for the quality of the metal, orfor the beauty of the workmanship. Spurius Carvilius alsoerected the statue of Jupiter which is seen in the Capitol, after he<pb n="6166" />had conquered the Samnites,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> who fought in obedience to a mostsolemn oath; it being formed out of their breast-plates, greaves,and helmets, and of such large dimensions that it may beseen from the statue of Jupiter Latiaris.<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> He made hisown statue, which is at the feet of the other one, out of thefilings of the metal. There are also, in the Capitol, two headswhich are very much admired, and which were dedicated bythe Consul P. Lentulus, one of them executed by the above-mentionedChares,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> the other by Decius;<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> but this last is sogreatly excelled by the former, as to have all the appearance ofbeing the work of one of the poorest of artists.</p><p>But all these gigantic statues of this kind have been surpassedin our own age by that of Mercury, made by Zenodotus<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>for the city of the Arverni in Gaul,<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> which was ten years inbeing completed, and the making of which cost four hundredthousand sesterces. Having given sufficient proof thereof his artistic skill, he was sent for by Nero to Rome, wherehe made a colossal statue intended to represent that prince,one hundred and ten feet in height. In consequence, however,of the public detestation of Nero's crimes, this statue was consecratedto the Sun.<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> We used to admire in his studio, notonly the accurate likeness in the model of clay, but in thesmall sketches<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> also, which served as the first foundationof the work. This statue proves that the art of fusing[precious] brass was then lost, for Nero was prepared to furnish<pb n="6167" />the requisite gold and silver, and Zenodotus was inferior tonone of the ancients, either as a designer or as an engraver.<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span>At the time that he was working at the statue for the Arverni,he copied for Dubius Avitus, the then governor of the province,two drinking-cups, chased by the hand of Calamis,<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> whichhad been highly prized by Germanicus C¾sar, and had beengiven by him to his preceptor Cassius Silanus, the uncle ofAvitus; and this with such exactness, that they could scarcelybe distinguished from the originals. The greater, then, the superiorityof Zenodotus, the more certainly it may be concludedthat the secret of fusing [precious] brass is lost.</p><p>(8.) Persons who possess what are called Corinthian bronzes,<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span>are generally so much enamoured of them, as to carry themabout with them from place to place; Hortensius, the orator,for instance, who possessed a Sphinx, which he had madeVerres give him, when accused. It was to this figure thatCicero alluded, in an altercation which took place at the trial:when, upon Hortensius saying that he could not understandenigmas, Cicero made answer that he ought to understandthem, as he had got a Sphinx<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> at home. The Emperor Nero,also, used to carry about with him the figure of an Amazon, ofwhich I shall speak further hereafter;<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> and, shortly before this,C. Cestius, a person of consular<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> rank, had possessed a figure,which he carried with him even in battle. The tent, too, ofAlexander the Great was usually supported, it is said, by statues,two of which are consecrated before the Temple of MarsUltor,<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span> and a similar number before the Palace.<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span><pb n="6168" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. iv. c. 27.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It was a statue of Jupiter.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Better known by the name of Q.
