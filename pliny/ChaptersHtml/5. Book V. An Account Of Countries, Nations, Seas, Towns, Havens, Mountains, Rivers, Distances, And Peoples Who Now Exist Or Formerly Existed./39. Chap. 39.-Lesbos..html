It was formerly called Himerte,Lasia, Pelasgia, Ægira, Æthiope, and Macaria, and isfamous for its nine cities. Of these, however, that of Pyrrhahas been swallowed up by the sea, Arisbe<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> has perished byan earthquake, and Methymna is now united to Antissa<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>;these lie in the vicinity of nine cities of Asia, along acoast of thirty-seven miles. The towns of Agamede and<pb n="1488" />Hiera have also perished. Eresos<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, Pyrrha, and the freecity of Mitylene<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>, still survive, the last of which was apowerful city for a space of <date value="1500" authname="1500">1500</date> years. The circumferenceof the whole island is, according to Isidorus, 168 miles<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>,but the older writers say 195. Its mountains are, Lepethymnus, Ordymnus, Maicistus, Creon, and Olympus. It isdistant seven miles and a half from the nearest point of themainland. The islands in its vicinity are, Sandaleon, andthe five called Leucæ<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>; Cydonea<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>, which is one of them,contains a warm spring. The Arginussæ<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> are four milesdistant from Æge<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>; after them come Phellusa<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> and Pedna.Beyond the Hellespont, and opposite the shore of Sigeum,lies Tenedos<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>, also known by the names of Leucophrys<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>,Phœnice, and Lyrnesos. It is distant from Lesbos fifty-sixmiles, and twelve and a half from Sigeum.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Mitylene, or Metelin.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We find it also stated by Herodotus, that this island was destroyedby the Methymnæans.
