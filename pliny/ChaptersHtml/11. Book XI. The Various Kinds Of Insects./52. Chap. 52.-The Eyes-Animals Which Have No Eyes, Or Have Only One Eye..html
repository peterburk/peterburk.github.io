Eyes,however, have not been granted to all animals; oysters havenone, but, with reference to some of the shell-fish, the questionis still doubtful; for if we move the fingers before a scallophalf open, it will immediately close its shell, apparently fromseeing them, while the solen<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> will start away from an ironinstrument when placed near it. Among quadrupeds themole<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> has no sight, though it has something that bears a resemblance to eyes, if we remove the membrane that is extended in front of them. Among birds also, it is said thata species of heron, which is known as the "leucus,"<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> iswanting of one eye: a bird of most excellent augury, whenit flies towards the south or north, for it is said that itportends thereby that there is about to be an end of perils andalarms. Nigidius says also, that neither locusts nor grasshoppers have eyes. In snails,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> the two small horns with whichthey feel their way, perform the duties of eyes. Neither themawworm<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> nor any other kind of worm has eyes.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or razor-sheath.
