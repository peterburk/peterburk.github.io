This substance is preparedfrom three different sources. It is prepared, they say,from a mineral pyrites, which is heated in the furnace untilit is converted by calcination into a red earth. It is alsomade in Cyprus, from a slimy substance extracted from a certaincavern there, which is first dried and then gradually heated,by a fire made of twigs. A third way of making it, is fromthe residue in the copper-furnaces that falls to the bottom.The difference between the component parts of the ore is this;the copper itself runs into the receivers, the scoriæ make theirescape from the furnace, the flower becomes sublimated, andthe diphryx remains behind.</p><p>Some say that there are certain globules in the ore, whilebeing smelted, which become soldered together; and that therest of the metal is fused around it, the mass itself not becomingliquefied, unless it is transferred to another furnace, and forminga sort of knot, as it were, in the metal. That which remainsafter the fusion, they say, is called "diphryx." Its use in medicineis similar to that of the substances mentioned above;<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> it<pb n="6205" />is desiccative, removes morbid excrescenses, and acts as a detergent.It is tested by placing it on the tongue, which ought tobe instantly parched by it, a coppery flavour being perceptible.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From <foreign lang="greek">Di\s fruge/sqai</foreign>.—" being twice calcined."—B.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Scoriæ, Cadmia, and Flos, which are described in Chapters 22,23 and 24.—B.</p></body>
