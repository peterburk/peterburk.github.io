<div2 type="chapter" n="7" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 7. (7.)—THE COMBATS OF ELEPHANTS.</head><p>There is a famous combat mentioned of a Roman with anelephant, when Hannibal compelled our prisoners to fightagainst each other. The one who had survived all the othershe placed before an elephant, and promised him his life if heshould slay it; upon which the man advanced alone into thearena, and, to the great regret of the Carthaginians, succeededin doing so.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> Hannibal, however, thinking that the news ofthis victory might cause a feeling of contempt for these animals, sent some horsemen to kill the man on his way home.In our battles with Pyrrhus it was found, on making trial,that it was extremely easy to cut off the trunks of these animals.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> Fenestella informs us, that they fought at Rome inthe Circus for the first time during the curule ædileshipof Claudius Pulcher, in the consulship of M. Antonius and A.Postumius, in the year of the City 655; and that twenty yearsafterwards, during the curule ædileship of the Luculli, theywere set to fight against bulls. In the second consulship<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> of<pb n="2253" />Pompeius, at the dedication of the temple of Venus Victrix,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>twenty elephants, or, as some say, seventeen, fought in theCircus against a number of Gætulians, who attacked them withjavelins. One of these animals fought in a most astonishingmanner; being pierced through the feet, it dragged itself onits knees towards the troop, and seizing their bucklers, tossedthem aloft into the air: and as they came to the ground theygreatly amused the spectators, for they whirled round andround in the air, just as if they had been thrown up with acertain degree of skill,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> and not by the frantic fury of a wildbeast. Another very wonderful circumstauce happened; anelephant was killed by a single blow. The weapon piercedthe animal below the eye, and entered the vital part of thehead. The elephants attempted, too, by their united efforts, tobreak down the enclosure, not without great confusion amongthe people who surrounded the iron gratings.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> It was in consequence of this circumstance, that Cæsar, the Dictator, whenhe was afterwards about to exhibit a similar spectacle, had thearena surrounded with trenches<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> of water, which were latelyfilled up by the Emperor Nero,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> when he added the seats for<pb n="2254" />the equestrian order.<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> When, however, the elephants in theexhibition given by Pompeius had lost all hopes of escaping,they implored the compassion of the multitude by attitudeswhich surpass all description, and with a kind of lamentationbewailed their unhappy fate. So greatly were the peopleaffected by the scene, that, forgetting the general altogether,and the munificence which had been at such pains to do themhonour, the whole assembly rose up in tears, and showeredcurses on Pompeius, of which he soon afterwards became thevictim. They fought also in the third consulship of the Dic-tator Cæsar, twenty of them against five hundred foot soldiers.<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>On another occasion twenty elephants, carrying towers,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> andeach defended by sixty men, were opposed to the same numberof foot soldiers as before, and an equal number of horsemen.Afterwards, under the Emperors Claudius and Nero, the lastexploit<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> that the gladiators performed was fighting singlehanded<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> with elephants.</p><p>The elephant is said to display such a merciful dispositiontowards animals that are weaker than itself, that, when itfinds itself in a flock of sheep, it will remove with its trunk<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>those that are in the way, lest it should unintentionally<pb n="2255" />trample upon them.<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> They will never do any mischief exceptwhen provoked, and they are of a disposition so sociable, thatthey always move about in herds, no animal being less fond ofa solitary life. When surrounded by a troop of horsemen,they place in the centre of the herd those that are weak,weary, or wounded, and then take the front rank each in itsturn, just as though they acted under command and in accordance with discipline. When taken captive, they are veryspeedily tamed, by being fed on the juices of barley.<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Val. Maximus, B. ix. c. 2, gives an account of the brutality of Hannibal on this occasion, in forcing the Roman captives to fight against eachother, until only one was left; but he does not make mention of the combat with the elephant.—B.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Florus, B. i. c. 18, states, that this was practised in the later engagements with Pyrrhus, and that by these means the elephants were eitherdestroyed or rendered useless. Cuvier remarks, that the trunk is composedof small muscles and fatty matter, enveloped by a tendinous membrane, andcovered with skin.—B.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A.U.C. 678.—B.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Venus the Conqueror." This temple was dedicated by Pompey,after his conquests in the East, in his second consulship, B.C. <date value="-55" authname="-55">55</date>.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny here refers to an art, practised among the Romans, of throwingup a shield into the air, in such a manner that, after performing a circuit,it would fall down on a certain spot; this trick is also alluded to by Martial, B. ix. Ep. 39.—B. The exercise with the boomerang, which was knownto the ancient Assyrians, and has been borrowed in modern times fromthe people of Australasia, seems to have been somewhat similar to this.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Clathri." These were gratings of iron trellis-work, placed in frontof the lowest row of the spectators, to protect them from the wild beasts.This exhibition took place in Pompey's Amphitheatre, in the Campus Mar-tius. The arena of the amphitheatre was mostly surrounded by a wall,distinguished by the name of "podium," which was generally about eighteenfeet in height, and the top of which was protected by this trellis-work. Inthe present instance, however, the "podium" can hardly have been so muchas eighteen feet in height.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Euripis." Julius Cæsar caused a canal, ten feet wide, to be formedin the Circus Maximus, around the bottom of the "podium," to protect thespectators from the wild beasts. These "euripi" probably took theirname from the narrow channel so called, which lay between Bœotia andthe island of Eubœa.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We learn, however, from Lampridius, in his Life of Heliogabalus,that this euripus was afterwards restored to the Circus.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Tacitus and Suetonius mention this separation of the equites fromthe rest of the spectators: it took place A.U.C. 816.—B. Up to the timeof Augustus, A.U.C. 758, the senators, equites, and people sat indiscriminatelyin the Circus; but that emperor, and after him Claudius, Nero, and Domitian, separated the senators and the equites from the commons.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There are coins which bear the figure of an elephant and the wordCæsar, probably struck in commemoration of these games.—B.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The practice of placing towers filled with soldiers on the backs of theelephants is alluded to by Lucretius, B. v. 1. <date value="1301" authname="1301">1301</date>, and by Juvenal, Sat.xii. 1. 110.—B. It still prevails in India.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Consummatione gladiatorum." There is some doubt about the exactmeaning of this. It may mean, "at the conclusion of the gladiatorialgames," as exhibited; or, what is more probable, "as the crowning exploitof the gladiators," who wished thereby to secure their manumission, whichwas granted after remarkable feats of valour. Cælius Rhodiginus, B. xi.c. 11, prefers this last meaning: Dalechamps, with whom Ajasson coincides,the first.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Postea singulis." Those who coincide with Dalechamps and Ajasson, as to the meaning, would read it, that at the end of the gladiatorialgames, the elephants fought singly one against another, the gladiatorshaving retired from the arena.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny here uses the word "manu," "hand," which although, as heafterwards remarks, it may not be an inappropriate metaphor, could scarcelybe admitted in our language.—B.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This trait has been observed in all ages; the elephant has been knownto remove with its trunk a child lying in its way, and in danger of beinginjured. It appears to have an instinctive dread of trampling on a livinganimal; the same has also been observed in the horse.—B.</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Hordeo succo;" the exact meaning has been the subject of muchdiscussion; it probably refers to some preparation of barley used by theancients, perhaps a maceration of the corn in water; it is scarcely to besupposed, however, that the words are to be taken literally.—B.</p></body>
