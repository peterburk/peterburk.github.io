Heinforms us that the owlet, the horned owl, the woodpecker,which makes holes in trees, the trygon, and the crow, are produced from the egg with the tail<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> first; for the egg, beingturned upside down through the weight of the head of thechick, presents the wrong end to be warmed by the motheras she sits upon it.<pb n="2494" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier ridicules the excessive ignorance of the augurs.
