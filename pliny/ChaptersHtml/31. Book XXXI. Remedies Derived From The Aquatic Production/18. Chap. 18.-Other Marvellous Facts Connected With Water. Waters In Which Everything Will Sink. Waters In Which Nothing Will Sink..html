<div2 type="chapter" n="18" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 18.ÑOTHER MARVELLOUS FACTS CONNECTED WITH WATER.WATERS IN WHICH EVERYTHING WILL SINK. WATERS IN WHICHNOTHING WILL SINK.</head><p>If any of the above-mentioned facts have the appearanceof being incredible to a person, I would have him know thatthere is no department of Nature which presents greater marvels than this, independently of the numerous peculiaritieswhich have been already mentioned<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> in an earlier part of thiswork. Ctesias informs us that, in India, there is a lake ofstanding water, upon which nothing<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> will float, every objectinstantly sinking to the bottom. C¾lius says that in thewaters of Lake Avernus,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> in our own part of the world, thevery leaves of the trees even will sink; and, according toVarro, these waters are fatal to such birds as fly towards them.</p><p>On the other hand, again, in the waters of Lake Apuscidamus,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> in Africa, nothing will sink; the same, too, Apion tells<pb n="5480" />us, with the fountain of Plinthia in Sicily, as also a certainlake in Media, and the well of Saturn. The spring of Limyra<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> not unfrequently makes its way through the neighbouring localities, and when it does so, is always portentous ofsome coming event. It is a singular thing too, that the fishalways accompany its waters on these occasions; the inhabitants of the adjoining districts being in the habit of consulting them by offering them food. When the fishes seize it withavidity, the answer is supposed to be favourable; but if, on theother hand, they reject the food, by flapping it with their tails,the response is considered to be unfavourable. The riverHolcas, in Bithynia, runs close to Bryazus,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> the name of atemple and of a divinity there worshipped; persons guilty ofperjury, it is said, cannot endure contact with its waters,which burn like flame.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span></p><p>The sources, too, of the Tamaricus,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> a river of Cantabria,are considered to possess certain powers of presaging futureevents: they are three in number, and, separated solely by aninterval of eight feet, unite in one channel, and so form a mightystream. These springs are often dry a dozen times in the day,sometimes as many as twenty, without there being the slightest trace of water there: while, on the other hand, a springclose at hand is flowing abundantly and without intermission.It is considered an evil presage when persons who wish to seethese springs find them dry: a circumstance which happenedvery recently, for example, to Lartius Licinius,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> who held theoffice of legatus after his pr¾torship; for at the end of sevendays after his visit he died.</p><p>In Jud¾a there is a river<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> that is dry every Sabbath day.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. ii. c. 106.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Sotion, professing to quote from Ctesias, says that it rejected everythingplaced on its waters, and hurled it back upon dry land.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Whence, as it was said, its name, <foreign lang="greek">a)/ornos,</foreign> "Without birds." Straboridicules this story.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">M. Douville says that in the interior of Africa there is a lake calledKalouga Kouffona, or the Dead Lake, the surface of which is covered withbitumen and naphtha, which contains no fish, has oleaginous waters, andpresents all the ph¾nomena of the Dead Sea.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In Lycia.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hardouin is of opinion that a river also was so called.

Josephus saysthat it flowed on the Sabbath day, and was dry the other six.</p></body>
