<div2 type="chapter" n="39" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 39. (25.)â€”THE NATURAL ORDER OF THE PRODUCTION OFPLANTS.</head><p>The following is the order in which the operations of Nature take place throughout the year. The first is fecundation,which takes place when the west wind begins to prevail, generally about the sixth day before the ides of February.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> Bythe agency of this wind all the productions of the earth areimpregnated; to such an extent, indeed, that the mares evenin Spain are impregnated by it, as we have already stated.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>This is the generating principle of the universe, and it receives its name of Favonius, as some think, from our word"fovere," which means "to warm and cherish:" it blowsfrom due west at the opening of the spring. The peasantrycall this period of the year the "time of heat,"<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> because Nature is then longing to receive the seeds of her various productions, and is imparting life to everything that is planted.The vegetables conceive<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> on various days, each according to<pb n="3380" />its respective nature: some immediately, as with animals,others, again, more slowly, carrying with them for a longerperiod the produce of their conception, a state which has fromthat circumstance obtained the name of "germination." Whenthe plant flowers, it may be said to bring forth, and the flowermakes its appearance by bursting its little capsule, which hasacted to it as an uterus. The period of training and educationis the growth of the fruit. This, as well as that of germination, is a laborious process.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Eighth of February.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. viii. c. 67.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Catlitio.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He alludes to the period of the rising of the sap; an entirely distinct process from germination.</p></body>
