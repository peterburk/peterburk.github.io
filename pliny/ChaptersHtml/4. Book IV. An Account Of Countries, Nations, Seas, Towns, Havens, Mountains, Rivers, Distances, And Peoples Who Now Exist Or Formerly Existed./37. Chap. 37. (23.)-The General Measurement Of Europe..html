<div2 type="chapter" n="37" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 37. (23.)—THE GENERAL MEASUREMENT OF EUROPE.</head><p>Having thus made the circuit of Europe, we must nowgive the complete measurement of it, in order that thosewho wish to be acquainted with this subject may not feelthemselves at a loss. Artemidorus and Isidorus have givenits length, from the Tanais to Gades, as 8214 miles. Polybius in his writings has stated the breadth of Europe, in aline from Italy to the ocean, to be 1150 miles. But, evenin his day, its magnitude was but little known. The distanceof Italy, as we have previously<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> stated, as far as the Alps, is1120 miles, from which, through Lugdunum to the Britishport of the Morini<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>, the direction which Polybius seems to<pb n="1370" />follow, is 1168 miles. But the better ascertained, thoughgreater length, is that taken from the Alps through theCamp of the Legions<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> in Germany, in a north-westerlydirection, to the mouth of the Rhine, being 1543 miles.We shall now have to speak of Africa and Asia.</p><p>Summary.—Towns and nations mentioned * * * *.

He was originally a freedman of the jurist Ateius Capito, by whom he was described as "a rhetorician among grammarians, and a grammarian among rhetoricians." He was on terms of intimacy with Sallust the historian, and Asinius Pollio. It is supposed that he assisted Sallust in the compilation of his history; but to what extent is not known. But few of his numerous commentaries were extant even in the time of Suetonius.</p><p><span id="note_17"><a href="#ref_17">17. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A native of Megalopolis in Arcadia, born about B.C. <date value="-204" authname="-204">204</date>. He was trained probably in political knowledge and the military art under Philopœmen, and was sent as a prisoner to Rome, with others, to answer the charge of not aiding the Romans in their war against Perseus. Here, by great good fortune, he secured the friendship of Scipio Africanus, with whom he was present at the destruction of Carthage. His history is one of the most valuable works that has come down to us from antiquity.</p><p><span id="note_18"><a href="#ref_18">18. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Of Miletus, one of the earliest and most distinguished Greek historians and geographers. He lived about the 65th Olympiad, or B.C. <date value="-520" authname="-520">520</date>. A few fragments, quoted, are all that are left of his historical and geographical works. There is little doubt that Herodotus extensively availed himself of this writer's works, though it is equally untrue that he has transcribed whole passages from him, as Porphyrius has ventured to assert.</p><p><span id="note_19"><a href="#ref_19">19. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Of Mitylene, supposed to have flourished about B.C. <date value="-450" authname="-450">450</date>.

He wrote a work "On Harbours," in ten books, which was copied by Eratosthenes, and is frequently quoted by ancient writers.

Though anxious to disclose the truth, he has been accused of sometimes forcing his authorities to suit his own views. Of his history of Greece, and his essays on various subjects, a few fragments only survive.</p><p><span id="note_26"><a href="#ref_26">26. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A grammarian of Mallus, in Cilicia. He lived in the time of Ptolemy Philopater, and resided at Pergamus, under the patronage of Eumenes II. and Attalus II. In his grammatical system he made a strong distinction between <hi rend="ital">criticism</hi> and <hi rend="ital">grammar,</hi> the latter of which sciences he regarded as quite subordinate to the former.

He was banished from Sicily by Agathocles, and passed his exile at Athens. He composed a History of Sicily, from the earliest times to the year B.C. <date value="-264" authname="-264">264</date>. The value of his history has been gravely attacked by Polybius; but there is little doubt that it possessed very considerable merit.

When he lived is unknown. Dionysius, of Halicarnassus, has borrowed from him a portion of his account of the Pelasgians. He is said to have been the author of the notion that the Tyrrhenians, in consequence of their wanderings after they left their original settlement, got the name of <foreign lang="greek">pelargoi\,</foreign> or "storks."

One of the earliest philosophers of the Ionian school, and said to be a pupil of Thales. Unless Pherecydes of Scyros be an exception, he was the first author of a philosophical treatise in Greek prose. Other writings are ascribed to him by Suidas; but, no doubt, on insufficient grounds. Of his treatise, which seems to have contained summary statements of his opinions, no remains exist.</p><p><span id="note_39"><a href="#ref_39">39. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Of this writer nothing whatever is known, beyond the fact that, from his name, he seems to have been a native of Mallus, in Cilicia.</p><p><span id="note_40"><a href="#ref_40">40. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It seems impossible to say which, out of the vast number of the authors who bore this name, is the one here referred to. It is not improbable that Dionysius of Chalcis, a Greek historian who lived before the Christian era, is meant. He wrote a work on the Foundation of Towns, in five books, which is frequently referred to by the ancients. It is not probable that the author of the Periegesis, or "Description of the World," is referred to, as that book bears internal marks of having been compiled in the third or fourth century of the Christian era.</p><p><span id="note_41"><a href="#ref_41">41. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Of Miletus. He was the author of the "Milesiaca," a romance of licentious character, which was translated into Latin by L. Cornelius Sisenna.
