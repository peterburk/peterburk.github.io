In the land animals, it is quite evident thatall that have eyelids sleep. With reference to aquatic animals,it is admitted that they also sleep, though only for shortperiods, even by those writers who entertain doubts as to theother animals; and they come to this conclusion, not from anyappearance of the eyes, for they have no eyelids, indeed, to close,<pb n="2553" />but because they are to be seen buried in deep repose, and to allappearance fast asleep, betraying no motion in any part ofthe body except the tail, and by starting when they happento hear a noise. With regard to the thunny, it is stated withstill greater confidence that it sleeps; indeed, it is often foundin that state near the shore, or among the rocks. Flat fish arealso found fast asleep in shallow water, and are often taken inthat state with the hand: and, as to the dolphin and thebalæna, they are even heard to snore.</p><p>It is quite evident, also, that insects sleep, from the silentstillness which they preserve; and even if a light is put closeto them, they will not be awoke thereby.</p></div2></body>
