<div2 type="chapter" n="51" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 51.ÑWHICH TREES BECOME OLD WITH THE GREATESTRAPIDITY, AND WHICH MOST SLOWLY.</head><p>There are great differences also in trees in respect to age.The almond and the pear<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> are the most fruitful when old, whichis the case also with the glandiferous trees and a certain species of fig. Others, again, are most prolific when young,though the fruit is later in coming to maturity, a thing particularly to be observed in the vine; for in those that are oldthe wine is of better quality, while the produce of the youngertrees is given in greater abundance. The apple-tree becomesold very early, and the fruit which it produces when old is ofinferior quality, being of smaller size and very liable to beattacked by maggots: indeed, these insects will breed in thetree itself. The fig is the only one of all the fruit-trees that issubmitted to any process with the view of expediting theripening of the fruit,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> a marvellous thing, indeed, that a greatervalue should be set upon produce that comes out of its properseason! All trees which bear their fruit before the propertime become prematurely<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> old; indeed, some of them wither<pb n="3390" />and die all of a sudden, being utterly exhausted by the toofavourable influence of the weather, a thing that happens tothe vine more particularly.</p><p>(28.) On the other hand, the mulberry becomes aged<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> butvery slowly, and is never exhausted by its crops. Those trees,too, the wood of which is variegated, arrive at old age butslowly,Ñthe palm, the maple, and the poplar, for instance.</p><p>(29.) Trees grow old more rapidly when the earth isploughed and loosened about the<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> roots; forest trees at a laterperiod. Speaking in general terms, we may say that careemployed in the culture of trees seems to promote their fertility, while increased fertility accelerates old age. Hence itis that the carefully tended trees are the first to blossom, andthe first to bud; in a word, are the most precocious in everyrespect: but all natural productions which are in any wayweakened are more susceptible of atmospheric influences.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He speaks here in too general terms: the pear, for instance, is notmore fruitful when old than when young.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He speaks of the process of caprification.
