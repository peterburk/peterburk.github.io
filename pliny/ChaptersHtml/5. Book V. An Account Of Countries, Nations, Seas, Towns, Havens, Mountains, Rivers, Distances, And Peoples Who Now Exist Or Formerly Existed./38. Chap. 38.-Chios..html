<div2 type="chapter" n="38" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 38.—CHIOS.</head><p>At a distance of ninety-four miles from Samos is the freeisland of Chios<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>, its equal in fame, with a town of the samename. Ephorus says, that the ancient name of this islandwas Æthalia: Metrodorus and Cleobulus tell us, that it hadthe name of Chia from the nymph Chione; others again say,that it was so called from the word signifying snow<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>; it wasalso called Macris and Pityusa<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>. It has a mountain calledPelennæus; and the Chian Marble is well known. It is 125<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>miles in circumference, according to the ancient writers; Isidorus however makes it nine more. It is situate betweenSamos and Lesbos, and, for the most part, lies opposite toErythræ<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>.</p><p>The adjacent islands are Thallusa<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>, by some writers calledDaphnusa<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>, Œnussa, Elaphitis, Euryanassa, and Arginusa,with a town of that name. All these islands are in the vicinity of Ephesus, as also those called the Islands of Pisistratus,Anthinæ, Myonnesos, Diarreusa,—in both of these lastthere were cities, now no longer in existence,—Poroselene<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>,<pb n="1487" />with a city of that name, Cerciæ, Halone<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>, Commone,Illetia, Lepria and Rhesperia, Procusæ, Bolbulæ, Phanæ,Priapos, Syce, Melane, Ænare, Sidusa, Pele, Drymusa<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>,Anhydros, Scopelos<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>, Sycussa, Marathussa, Psile, Perirreusa,and many others of no note. In the main sea lies thecelebrated island of Teos, with a city<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> of that name, seventy-one miles and a half distant from Chios, and the same fromthe Erythræ.</p><p>In the vicinity of Smyrna are the Peristerides<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>, Carteria,Alopece, Elæussa, Bachina, Pystira, Crommyonnesos, andMegale<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>. Facing Troas there are the Ascaniæ, and thethree islands called Plateæ. We find also the Lamiæ, thetwo islands called Plitaniæ, Plate, Scopelos, Getone, Arthedon,Cœlæ, Lagussæ, and Didymæ.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now known as Khio, Scio, Saka Adassi, or Saksadasi.
