<div2 type="chapter" n="79" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 79. (53.)—ANIMALS IN A HALF-WILD STATE.</head><p>In no species is the union with the wild animal so easy asin that of the swine; the produce of such unions was calledby the ancients hybrid,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> or half savage; which appellationhas also been transferred to the human race, as it was to C.Antonius, the colleague of Cicero in his consulship. Notonly, however, with respect to the hog, but all other animalsas well, wherever there is a tame species, there is a corresponding wild one as well; a fact which is equally true with reference to man himself, as is proved by the many races of wildmen of which we have already spoken.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> There is no kind ofanimal, however, that is divided into a greater number of varieties than the goat. There are the capræa,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> the rupicapraor rock-goat, and the ibex, an animal of wonderful swiftness,although its head is loaded with immense horns, which bear astrong resemblance to the sheath of a sword.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> By means ofthese horns the animal balances itself, when it darts alongthe rocks, as though it had been hurled from a sling;<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> moreespecially when it wishes to leap from one eminence to another. There are the oryges also,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> which are said to be the<pb n="2347" />only animals that have the hair the contrary way, the pointsbeing turned towards the head. There are the dama also,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>the pygargus,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> and the strepsiceros,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> besides many otherswhich strongly resemble them. The first mentioned of theseanimals,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> however, dwell in the Alps; all the others are sentto us from the parts beyond sea.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There has been some difference of opinion respecting the derivationof this word, but it is generally used to express a "mongrel," <hi rend="ital">i. e.</hi> an ani-mal whose parents are of different natures, or, when applied to the humanspecies, of different countries.—B.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. vii. c. 2.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is not easy to determine what animals Pliny intended to designate.Cuvier employs the terms "chlevreuils, chamois, and bouquetins," as thecorresponding words in the French. In English we have no names toexpress these varieties; we may, however, regard them generally, as different species of wild goats. Cuvier conceives that the Linnæan names ofthe animals mentioned were, probably, Cervus capreolus, Antelope rupicapra,and Capra ibex.—B.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The resemblance may be supposed to consist in the horns being hollow, and tapering to a point.—B.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There is considerable difficulty in ascertaining the correct reading,or the exact meaning which the writer intended to convey by the wordsemployed.—B.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There is some difficulty in determining the nature of the varietywhich Pliny terms "oryges;" Hardouin has collected the opinions of naturalists, and we have some remarks by Cuvier; he refers to Buffon'saccount of the Antelope oryx, as agreeing, in the essential points, with thedescription given by pliny; Lemaire, vol. iii. p. 554. See B. xi. c. 106.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier remarks, that there is some doubt respecting the dama ofPliny; he is, however, disposed to regard it as a species of antelope.Ajasson, vol. vi. p. 464, 465; Lemaire, vol. iii. p. 554.—B.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The term pygargus is derived from the words <foreign lang="greek">pugh\ a\rgo\s,</foreign> denoting"white buttocks." Probably a kind of gazelle.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"With twisted horns." It is probable that Pliny intended to designate a species of antelope,—B. See B. xi. c. 45.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In this division Pliny, probably, included what he has termed the"capræa," the rupicapra, and the ibex.—B.</p></body>
