(1.)â€”THE FIRST USE OF PRECIOUS STONES.</head><p>THAT nothing may be wanting to the work which I haveundertaken, it still remains for me to speak of precious stones:a subject in which the majestic might of Nature presents itselfto us, contracted within a very limited space, though, in theopinion of many, nowhere displayed in a more admirable form.So great is the value that men attach to the multiplied varietiesof these gems, their numerous colours, their constituent parts,and their singular beauty, that, in the case of some of them, itis looked upon as no less than sacrilege to engrave them, forsignets even, the very purpose for which, in reality, they weremade. Others, again, are regarded as beyond all price, and couldnot be valued at any known amount of human wealth; so muchso that, in the case of many, it is quite sufficient to have somesingle gem or other before the eyes, there to behold the supremeand absolute perfection of Nature's work.</p><p>We have already<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> stated, to some extent, when speaking onthe subject of gold and rings, how the use of precious stonesfirst originated, and from what beginnings this admiration ofthem has now increased to such an universal passion. Accordingto fabulous lore, the first use of them was suggestedby the rocks of Caucasus, in consequence of an unhappy interpretationwhich was given to the story of the chains of Prometheus:for we are told by tradition, that he enclosed a fragmentof this stone in iron, and wore it upon his finger;<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> suchbeing the first ring and the first jewel known.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. xxxiii. c. 4.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This being imposed as a punishment on him, in remembrance of hissacrilegious crimes, when released by Jupiter from the rock.
