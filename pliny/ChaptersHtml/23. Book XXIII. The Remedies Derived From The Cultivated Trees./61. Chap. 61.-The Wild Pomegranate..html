The roots of it have a red bark, which taken inwine in doses of one denarius, promotes sleep. The seed of<pb n="4502" />it taken in drink is curative of dropsy. Gnats are kept at adistance by the smoke of burnt pomegranate rind.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">FŽe thinks that there is no doubt that this was really the pomegranate,left to grow wild. Dalechamps and FŽe suggest that, misled by theresemblance of the Greek names, Pliny has here attributed to the wildpomegranate the properties attributed to the red poppy, or corn poppy.Hardouin, however, is not of that opinion, and thinks that the mention ofthe <hi rend="ital">roots</hi> of the plant proves that Pliny has not committed any error here;as in B. xx. c. 77, he has attributed the narcotic effects of the poppy tothe head only.</p></body>
