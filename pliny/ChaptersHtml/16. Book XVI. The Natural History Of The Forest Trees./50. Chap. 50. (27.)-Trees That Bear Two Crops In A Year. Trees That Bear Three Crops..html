TREESTHAT BEAR THREE CROPS.</head><p>In the island of Cea there are wild figs that bear three timesin one year. By the first crop the one that succeeds is summoned forth, and by that the third. It is by the agency ofthis last crop that caprification<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> is performed. In the wildfig, too, the fruit grows on the opposite side of the leaves.There are some pears and apples, too, that bear two crops inthe year, while there are some early varieties also. The wildapple bears twice<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> in the year, its second crop coming on afterthe rising of Arcturus,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> in sunny localities more particularly.There are vines, too, that will even bear three times in theyear, a circumstance that has procured for them the name of"frantic"<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> vines. On these we see grapes just ripening, othersbeginning to swell, and others, again, in blossom, all at thesame moment.</p><p>M. Varro<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> informs us, that there was formerly at Smyrna,near<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> the Temple of the Mother of the Gods, a vine that boretwo crops in the year, as also an apple-tree of a similar naturein the territory of Consentia. This, however, is constantly tobe witnessed in the territory of Tacapa,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> in Africa, of whichwe shall have to speak more fully on another occasion,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> soremarkable is the fertility of the soil. The cypress also bearsthree times in the year, for its berries are gathered in the<pb n="3389" />months of January, May, and September, being all three ofdifferent size.</p><p>There are also certain peculiarities observed in the differentmodes in which the trees bear their fruit, the arbutus and thequercus being most fruitful in the upper part, the walnut andthe marisca<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> fig in the lower. All trees, the older they grow,the more early they bear, and this more particularly in sunnyspots and where the soil is not over-rich. All the forest-treesare slower in bringing their fruit to maturity; and indeed, insome of them the fruit never becomes fully ripe.<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> Those trees,too, about the roots of which the earth is ploughed or brokenand loosened, bring their fruit to maturity more speedily thanthose in which this has been neglected; by this process theyare also rendered more fruitful.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xv. c. 21.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This does not happen in the northern climates; though sometimes itis the case that a fruit-tree blossoms again towards the end of summer, andit the autumn is fine and prolonged, these late fruits will ripen.
