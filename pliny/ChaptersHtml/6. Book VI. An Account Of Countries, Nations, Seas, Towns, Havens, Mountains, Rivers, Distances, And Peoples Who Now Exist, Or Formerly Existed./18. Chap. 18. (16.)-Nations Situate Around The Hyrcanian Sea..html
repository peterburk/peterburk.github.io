<div2 type="chapter" n="18" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 18. (16.)—NATIONS SITUATE AROUND THE HYRCANIAN SEA.</head><p>Lying to the east of the Caspii is the region known as Apavortene,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> in which there is a place noted for its singular fertility, called Dareium.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> We then come to the nations of theTapyri,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> the Anariaci, the Staures, and the Hyrcani, pastwhose shores and beyond the river Sideris<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> the Caspian beginsto take the name of the 'Hyrcanian' Sea: on this side ofthat stream are also the rivers Maxeras and Strato: all ofthem take their rise in the Caucasian chain. Next comes<pb n="2031" />the district of Margiane,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> so remarkable for its sunny climate.It is the only spot in all these regions that produces the vine,being shut in on every side by verdant and refreshing hills.This district is fifteen hundred stadia in circumference, but isrendered remarkably difficult of access by sandy deserts, whichextend a distance of one hundred and twenty miles: it liesopposite to the country of Parthia, and in it Alexander foundedthe city of Alexandria. This place having been destroyedby the barbarians, Antiochus,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> the son of Seleucus, rebuilt iton the same site as a Syrian city.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> For, seeing that it waswatered by the Margus,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> which passes through it, and is afterwards divided into a number of streams for the irrigation ofthe district of Zothale, he restored it, but preferred givingit the name of Antiochia.<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> The circumference of this city isseventy stadia: it was to this place that Orodes conducted suchof the Romans as had survived the defeat of Crassus. Fromthe mountain heights of this district, along the range ofCaucasus, the savage race of the Mardi, a free people, extendsas far as the Bactri.<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> Below the district inhabited by them,we find the nations of the Orciani, the Commori, the Berdrigæ,the Harmatotropi,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> the Citomaræ, the Comani, the Marucæi,and the Mandruani. The rivers here are the Mandrus and theChindrus.<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> Beyond the nations already mentioned, are the<pb n="2032" />Chorasmii,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> the Candari,<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> the Attasini, the Paricani, theSarangæ, the Marotiani, the Aorsi,<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> the Gaëli, by the Greekwriters called Cadusii,<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> the Matiani, the city of Heraclea,<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span>which was founded by Alexander, but was afterwards destroyed, and rebuilt by Antiochus, and by him called Achaïs; theDerbices also,<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> through the middle of whose territory the riverOxus<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> runs, after rising in Lake Oxus,<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> the Syrmatæ, the Oxydracæ, the Heniochi, the Bateni, the Saraparæ, and the Bactri,whose chief city is Zariaspe, which afterwards received the nameof Bactra, from the river<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> there. This last nation lies at the<pb n="2033" />back of Mount Paropanisus,<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> over against the sources of theriver Indus, and is bounded by the river Ochus.<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span> Beyond itare the Sogdiani,<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span> the town of Panda, and, at the very extremityof their territory, Alexandria,<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span> founded by Alexander theGreat. At this spot are the altars which were raised by Hercules and Father Liber, as also by Cyrus, Semiramis, andAlexander; for the expeditions of all these conquerors stoppedshort at this region, bounded as it is by the river Jaxartes,by the Scythians known as the Silis, and by Alexander andhis officers supposed to have been the Tanais. This river wascrossed by Demodamas, a general of kings Seleucus and Antiochus, and whose account more particularly we have herefollowed. He also consecrated certain altars here to ApolloDidymæus.<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">By some writers called Apavareticene, in the south-eastern part ofParthia. Ansart says that it is now known as Asterabad and Ghilan.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or Dara. A strongly fortified place, built by Arsaces I., and situateon the mountains of the Zapaorteni.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">According to Ansart, the district now known as Tabaristan, orMazanderan, derives the first of those names from the Tapyri.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">D'Anville remarks that this river still retains its "starry" name,being the modern Aster or Ester, on which Asterabad is situate.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This district occupied the southern part of modern Khiva, the southwestern part of Bokhara, and the north-eastern part of Khorassan. Thisprovince of the ancient Persian empire received its name from the riverMargus, now the Moorghab. It first became known to the Greeks bythe expeditions of Alexander and Antiochus I.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Antiochus Soter, the son of Seleucus Nicator.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The meaning of this, which has caused great diversity of opinionamong the Commentators, seems to be, that on rebuilding it, he preferredgiving it a name borne by several cities in Syria, and given to them inhonour of kings of that country. To this he appears to have beenprompted by a supposed resemblance which its site on the Margus bore tothat of Antiochia on the Orontes.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The modern Moorghab; it loses itself in the sands of Khiva.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Its remains are supposed to be those of an ancient city, still to be seenat a spot called Merv, on the river Moorghab.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The people of modern Bokhara.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This appears to mean the nations of "Chariot horse-breeders."</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In former editions, called the 'Gridinus.' It is impossible to identifymany of these nations and rivers, as the spelling varies considerably in therespective MSS.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">An extensive tribe of Sogdiana, now represented by the district ofKhawarezm, in the desert country of Khiva.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A tribe in the north-western part of Sogdiana. They appear to havebeen situate to the east of the district of Khawarezm. It has been suggested that they derived their name from the Sanscrit Gandharas, a tribebeyond the Indus.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The chief seat of the Aorsi, who appear to have been a numerousand powerful people both of Europe and Asia, was in the countrybetween the Tanais, the Euxine, the Caspian, and the Caucasus. It seemsdoubtful, however, whether it is these people who are alluded to in thepresent passage.</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">These would almost seem to be a different people from those mentioned in c. 15 of the present Book, as dwelling in Atropatene. The presentappears to have been a tribe of Sogdiana.</p><p><span id="note_17"><a href="#ref_17">17. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Strabo mentions a town of this name, which he places, together withApamea, in the direction of Rhagæ. If Pliny has observed anythinglike order in his recital of nations and places, the Heraclea here mentionedcannot be that spoken of by Strabo, but must have been distant nearly1000 miles from it.</p><p><span id="note_18"><a href="#ref_18">18. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This was a tribe, apparently of Scythian origin, settled in Margiana,on the left bank of the Oxus. Strabo says that they worshipped theearth, and forbore to sacrifice or slay any female; but that they put todeath their fellow-creatures as soon as they had passed their seventiethyear, it being the privilege of the next of kin to eat the flesh of the deceased person. The aged women, however, they used to strangle, andthen consign them to the earth.</p><p><span id="note_19"><a href="#ref_19">19. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The modern Jihoun or Amou. It now flows into the Sea of Aral,but the ancients universally speak of it as running into the Caspian; andthere are still existing distinct traces of a channel extending in a southwesterly direction from the sea of Aral to the Caspian, by which at least aportion, and probably the whole of the waters of the Oxus found their way.into the Caspian; and not improbably the Sea of Aral itself was connectedwith the Caspian by this channel.</p><p><span id="note_20"><a href="#ref_20">20. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Most probably under this name he means the Sea of Aral.</p><p><span id="note_21"><a href="#ref_21">21. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Bactrus. This river is supposed to be represented by the modernDakash. Hardouin says that Ptolemy, B. vi. c. 11, calls this river theZariaspis, or Zariaspes. See the Note at the end of c, 17, p. 30.</p><p><span id="note_22"><a href="#ref_22">22. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now known as the Hindoo-Koosh; a part of the great mountainchain which runs from west to east through the centre of the southernportion of the highlands of Central Asia, and so divides the part of thecontinent which slopes down to the Indian ocean from the great centraltable-land of Tartary and Thibet. The native term, Hindoo-Koosh, isonly a form of the ancient name "Indicus Caucasus," which was sometimes given to this chain. The ancient name was derived probably fromthe Persian word <hi rend="ital">paru,</hi>a "mountain."</p><p><span id="note_23"><a href="#ref_23">23. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Flowing from the north side of the Paropanisus. According to Plinyand Ptolemy, this river flowed through Bactria into the Oxus; but ac-cording to Strabo, through Iyrcania into the Caspian Sea. Some supposeit to have been only another name for the Oxus. Ansart suggests that itmay have been the river now known as the Bash.</p><p><span id="note_24"><a href="#ref_24">24. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">D'Anville says that there is still the valley of Al Sogd, in Tartary,beyond the Oxus. The district called Sogdiana was probably composedof parts of modern Turkistan and Bokhara. The site of Panda does notappear to be known.</p><p><span id="note_25"><a href="#ref_25">25. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It was built on the Jaxartes, to mark the furthest point reached byAlexander in his Scythian expedition. It has been suggested that themodern Kokend may possibly occupy its site.</p><p><span id="note_26"><a href="#ref_26">26. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The "twin," of the same birth with Diana.</p></body>
