THE VIPIO.</head><p>During the civil wars that took place at Bebriacum, beyondthe river Padus, the "new birds"<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> were introduced into ItalyÑfor by that name they are still known. They resemble thethrush in appearance, are a little smaller than the pigeon in<pb n="2530" />size, and of an agreeable flavour. The Balearic islands alsosend us a porphyrio,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> that is superior to the one previouslymentioned. There the buteo, a kind of hawk, is held in highesteem for the table, as also the vipio,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> the name given to asmall kind of crane.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Nov¾ aves."
