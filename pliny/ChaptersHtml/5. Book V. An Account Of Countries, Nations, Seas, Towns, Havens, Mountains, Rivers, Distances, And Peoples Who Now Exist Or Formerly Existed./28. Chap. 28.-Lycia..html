<div2 type="chapter" n="28" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 28.—LYCIA.</head><p>In Lycia, after leaving its promontory<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>, we come to thetown of Simena, Mount Chimæra<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>, which sends forth flamesby night, and the city of Hephæstium<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>, the heights abovewhich are also frequently on fire. Here too formerly stood thecity of Olympus<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>; now we find the mountain places knownas Gagæ<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>, Corydalla<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>, and Rhodiopolis<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>. Near the sea isLimyra<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> with a river of like name, into which the Arycandus<pb n="1456" />flows, Mount Masycites<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>, the state of Andriaca<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>, Myra<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>, thetowns of Aperræ<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> and Antiphellos<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>, formerly called Habessus,and in a corner Phellos<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>, after which comes Pyrra,and then the city of Xanthus<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>, fifteen miles from the sea,as also a river known by the same name. We then cometo Patara<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span>, formerly Pataros, and Sidyma, situate on a moun-<pb n="1457" />tain. Next comes the Promontory of Cragus<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span>, and beyondit a gulf<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span>, equal to the one that comes before it; upon it arePinara<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span>, and Telmessus<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span>, the frontier town of Lycia.</p><p>Lycia formerly contained seventy towns, now it has butthirty-six. Of these, the most celebrated, besides thosealready mentioned, are Canas<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span>, Candyba, so celebrated forthe Œnian Grove, Podalia, Choma, past which the riverÆdesa flows, Cyaneæ<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span>, Ascandalis, Amelas, Noscopium,Tlos<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span>, and Telandrus<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span>. It includes also in the interior thedistrict of Cabalia, the three cities of which are Œnianda,Balbura<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span>, and Bubon<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span>.<pb n="1458" /></p><p>On passing Telmessus we come to the Asiatic or CarpathianSea, and the district which is properly called Asia.Agrippa has divided this region into two parts; one of whichhe has bounded on the east by Phrygia and Lycaonia, on thewest by the Ægean Sea, on the south by the Egyptian Sea,and on the north by Paphlagonia, making its length to be473 miles and its breadth 320. The other part he hasbounded by the Lesser Armenia on the east, Phrygia, Lycaonia,and Pamphylia on the west, the province of Pontuson the north, and the Sea of Pamphylia on the south, makingit 575 miles in length and 325 in breadth.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Of Chelidonium, now Kheidonia, formed by the range of Taurus.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. ii. <hi rend="ital">c</hi>. 116. The flame which continually burned on this mountain has been examined by Beaufort, the modern traveller. The name of the mountain is now Yanar: it is formed of a mass of scaglia with serpentine. Spratt says that the flame is nothing more than a stream of inflammable gas issuing from a crevice, such as is seen in several places in the Apennines. By Homer it is represented as a fabulous monster, which is explained by Servius, the commentator of Virgil, in the following manner. He says that flames issue from the top of the mountain, and that there are lions in the vicinity; the middle part abounds in goats, and the lower part with serpents. Simena appears to be unknown.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">So called from <foreign lang="greek">(/Hfaists,</foreign> the Greek name of Vulcan. Pliny mentions this spot also in B. ii. c. 110. The flame probably proceeded from an inflammable gas, or else was ignited by a stream of naphtha.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">More generally known as Phœnicus, a flourishing city on Mount Olympus; now Yanar Dagh, a volcano on the eastern coast of Lycia, with which it often exchanged names. Having become the head-quarters of the pirates, it was destroyed by the Roman general Servilius Isauricus. Its ruins are to be seen at a spot called Deliktash.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Mentioned again in B. xxxvi. c. 34, as the spot whence the <hi rend="ital">gagates lapis</hi> or 'agate' took its name. The ruins at Aladja are regarded by Leake as marking the site of Gagæ; but Sir Charles Fellowes identifies the place with the modern village of Hascooe, the vicinity of which is covered with ruins.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">On the road from Phaselis in Lycia to Patara. Its site is a village called Hadgivella, about sixteen miles south-west of Phaselis. The remains are very considerable.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The remains of Rhodiopolis were found by Spratt and Forbes in the vicinity of Corydalla.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">On the Limyrus, probably the modern Phineka; the ruins to the north of which are supposed to be those of Limyra.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The modern Akhtar Dagh.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Andraki. This was the port of Myra, next mentioned. It stood at the mouth of the river now known as the Andraki. Cramer observes that it was here St. Paul was put on board the ship of Alexandria, Acts xxvii. 5, 6.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Still called Myra by the Greeks, but Dembre by the Turks. It was built on a rock twenty stadia from the sea. St. Paul touched here on his voyage as a prisoner to Rome, and from the mention made of it in Acts xxvii. 5, 6, it would appear to have been an important sea-port. There are magnificent ruins of this city still to be seen, in part hewn out of the solid rock.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From an inscription found by Cockerell at the head of the Hassac Bay, it is thought that <hi rend="ital">Aperlœ</hi> is the proper name of this place, though again there are coins of Gordian which give the name as <hi rend="ital">Aperrœ.</hi> It is fixed by the Stadismus as sixty stadia west of Somena, which Leake supposes to be the same as the Simena mentioned above by Pliny.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called Antephelo or Andifilo, on the south coast of Lycia, at the head of a bay. Its theatre is still complete, with the exception of the proscenium. There are also other interesting remains of antiquity.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Fellowes places the site of Phellos near a village called <hi rend="ital">Saaret,</hi> west-north-west of Antiphellos, where he found the remains of a town; but Spratt considers this to mark the site of the Pyrra of Pliny, mentioned above—judging from Pliny's words. Modern geographers deem it more consistent with his meaning to look for Phellos north of Antiphellos than in any other direction, and the ruins at Tchookoorbye, north of Antiphellos, on the spur of a mountain called Fellerdagh, are thought to be those of Phellos.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The most famous city of Lycia. It stood on the western bank of the river of that name, now called the Echen Chai. It was twice besieged, and on both occasions the inhabitants destroyed themselves with their property, first by the Persians under Harpagus, and afterwards by the Romans under Brutus. Among its most famous temples were those of Sarpedon and of the Lycian Apollo. The ruins now known by the name of Gunik, have been explored by Sir C. Fellows and other travellers, and a portion of its remains are now to be seen in the British Museun, under the name of the Xanthian marbles.</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Its ruins still bear the same name. It was a flourishing seaport, on a promontory of the same name, sixty stadia east of the mouth of the Xanthus. It was early colonized by the Dorians from Crete, and became a chief seat of the worship of Apollo, from whose son Patarus it was said to have received its name. Ptolemy Philadelphus enlarged it, and called it Arsinoë, but it still remained better known by its old name. This place was visited by St. Paul, who thence took ship for Phœnicia. See Acts xxi. 1.</p><p><span id="note_17"><a href="#ref_17">17. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This was more properly the name of a mountain district of Lycia. Strabo speaks of Cragus, a mountain with eight summits, and a city of the same name. Beaufort thinks that Yedy-Booroon, the Seven Capes, a group of high and rugged mountains, appear to have been the ancient Mount Cragus of Lycia.</p><p><span id="note_18"><a href="#ref_18">18. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably the Gulf of Macri, equal in size to the Gulf of Satalia, which is next to it.</p><p><span id="note_19"><a href="#ref_19">19. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This place lay in the interior at the base of Cragus, and its ruins are still to be seen on the east side of the range, about half-way between Telmessus and the termination of the range on the south coast.</p><p><span id="note_20"><a href="#ref_20">20. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Its ruins are to be seen at Mei, or the modern port of Macri.</p><p><span id="note_21"><a href="#ref_21">21. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Its site is unknown. That of Candyba has been ascertained to be a place called Gendevar, east of the Xanthus, and a few miles from the coast. Its rock-tombs are said to be beautifully executed. The Œnian grove or forest, it has been suggested, may still be recognized in the extensive pine forest that now covers the mountain above the city. The sites of Podalia and Choma seem to be unknown.</p><p><span id="note_22"><a href="#ref_22">22. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In some editions "Cyane." Leake says that this place was discovered to the west of Andriaca by Cockerell. It appears from Scott and Forbes's account of Lycia, that three sites have been found between port Tristorus and the inland valley of Kassabar, which from the inscriptions appeared anciently to have borne this name, Yarvoo, Ghiouristan, and Toussa. The former is the chief place and is covered with ruins of the Roman and middle-age construction. At Ghiouristan there are Lycian rock-tombs.</p><p><span id="note_23"><a href="#ref_23">23. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Its ruins are to be seen near the modern Doover, in the interior of Lycia, about two miles and a half east of the river Xanthus. Of the three places previously mentioned the sites appear to be unknown.</p><p><span id="note_24"><a href="#ref_24">24. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Mentioned by the geographer Stephanus as being in Caria.</p><p><span id="note_25"><a href="#ref_25">25. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Its site is fixed at Katara, on both sides of the Katara Su, the most northern branch of the Xanthus. The ruins are very considerable, lying on both sides of the stream. Balbura is a neuter plural.</p><p><span id="note_26"><a href="#ref_26">26. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It lay to the west of Balbura, near a place now called Ebajik, on a small stream that flows into the Horzoom Tchy. In B. xxxv. c. 17, Pliny mentions a kind of chalk found in the vicinity of this place. Its ruins are still to be seen, but they are not striking.</p></body>
