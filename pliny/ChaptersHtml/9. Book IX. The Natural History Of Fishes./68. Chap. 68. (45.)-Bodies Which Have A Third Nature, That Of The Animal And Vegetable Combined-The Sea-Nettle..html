<div2 type="chapter" n="68" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 68. (45.)ÑBODIES WHICH HAVE A THIRD NATURE, THAT OF THE ANIMAL AND VEGETABLE COMBINED-THE SEA-NETTLE.</head><p>Indeed, for my own part, I am strongly of opinion that thereis sense existing in those bodies which have the nature<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> ofneither animals nor vegetables, but a third which partakes ofthem both:Ñsea-nettles and sponges, I mean. The sea-nettle<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>wanders to and fro by night, and at night changes its locality.These creatures are by nature a sort of fleshy branch,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and arenurtured upon flesh. They have the power of producing an<pb n="2454" />itching, smarting pain,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> just like that caused by the nettle foundon land. For the purpose of seeking its prey, it contracts andstiffens itself to the utmost possible extent, and then, as asmall fish swims past, it will suddenly spread out its branches,and so seize and devour<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> it. At another time it will assumethe appearance of being quite withered away, and let itself betossed<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> to and fro by the waves like a piece of sea-weed, untilit happens to touch a fish. The moment it does so, the fishgoes to rub itself against a rock, to get rid of the itching; immediately upon which, the nettle pounces upon it. By nightalso it is on the look-out for scallops and sea-urchins. Whenit perceives a hand approaching it, it instantly changes itscolour, and contracts itself; when touched it produces aburning sensation, and if ever so short a time is afforded,makes its escape. Its mouth is situate, it is said, at the root orlower part,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> and the excrements<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> are discharged by a smallcanal situated above.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The zošphytes, or the zošdendra.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The wandering urtic¾, or sea-nettles, are the Medus¾ of Linn¾us;the stationary nettle is the Actinia of the same naturalist.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Camos¾ frondis his natura."</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Many species of the medus¾, Cuvier says, and other animals of thesame class, the physalus more especially, cause an itching sensation in theskin when they are touched. This is noticed also by ®lian, Hist. Anim.B. vii. c. 35; and by Diphilus of Siphnos, in Athen¾us, B. iii.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is true, Cuvier says, and more especially with reference to theactini¾. They have the mouth provided with numerous fleshy tentacles,by means of which they can seize very small animals which come withintheir reach, which they instantly swallow.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier says, that this is the case more especially with the medus¾and the physali.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Ora ei in radice." Aristotle, however, says, fist. Anim. B. iv. c. <hi rend="ital">5,</hi>and B. viii. c. 3, that the sea-nettle has the mouth situate <foreign lang="greek">e)n me/sw|,</foreign> "in themiddle of the body." Hardouin attempts to explain the passage on theground that Pliny has made a mistake, in an endeavour to suit his similitudeof a tree to the language of Aristotle. Cuvier says, that there exists onegenus or species of the medus¾, which appears to feed itself by the aid ofan apparatus of branches, and is divided into such a multitude of filaments,almost innumerable, that it bears a strong resemblance to the roots of atree or vegetable. It is this kind, he says, that he has called by the nameof "Rhizostomos."</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 3, says the same; though, on theother hand, in the Fourth Book, he says that the animal has no excrements,although it has a mouth, and feeds.</p></body>
