I will show you theresults of my own experience at Athens, and that, while it is agood plan to dip into their literature,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> it is not worth while tomake a thorough acquaintance with it. They are a most iniquitous and intractable race, and you may take my word as the wordof a prophet, when I tell you, that whenever that nation shallbestow its literature upon Rome it will mar everything; and thatall the sooner, if it sends its physicians among us. They haveconspired among themselves to murder all barbarians with theirmedicine; a profession which they exercise for lucre, in orderthat they may win our confidence,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and dispatch us all themore easily. They are in the common habit, too, of calling usbarbarians, and stigmatize us beyond all other nations, bygiving us the abominable appellation of Opici.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> I forbid youto have anything to do with physicians."</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Illorum literas inspicere."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">On the principle that that which costs money <hi rend="ital">must</hi> be worth having.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Opici or Osci were an ancient tribe of Italy, settled in Campania,Latium, and Samnium. From their uncivilized habits the name was longused as a reproachful epithet, equivalent to our words "bumpkin," "clodhopper," or "chawbacon."</p></body>
