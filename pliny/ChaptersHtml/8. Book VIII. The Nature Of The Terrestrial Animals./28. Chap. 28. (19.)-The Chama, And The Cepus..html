<div2 type="chapter" n="28" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 28. (19.)—THE CHAMA, AND THE CEPUS.</head><p>It was at the games of Pompeius Magnus that the chama<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span><pb n="2278" />was first exhibited; an animal called rufius by the Gauls;having the figure of a wolf, with the spots of the pard. Therewere also exhibited some animals from Æthiopia, which theycalled by the Greek name, <foreign lang="greek">xh/poi,</foreign><span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> the hinder extremities ofwhich resembled the human feet and legs, while the fore-feetwere like hands. These animals have not been seen at Romesince that time.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In the older editions, the names here given to this animal were"chaus" and "ruphius;" the alteration was made by Hardouin from aMS. in the Royal Library of Paris, which he deemed of high authority,and has been adopted by all the modern editors. There is considerabledoubt respecting the animal here designated by the name of "chama;" itappears to have been an inhabitant of Gaul, and in c. 34, is styled "lupusecrvarius;" but the account does not enable us to identify it with anyanimal known to exist in that country.—B. It is generally supposed tohave been a species of lynx.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">No doubt this description refers to some species of the monkey tribe,but it is uncertain to what one in particular. Its having been seen onlyonce at Rome, shows that it was not of the most common kind; Cuvier,however, thinks it probable, that Pliny may have been incorrect in this;he supposes that it was the "Simia sphinx" of Linnæus, Lem. vol. iii. p. 395.According to Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. ii. c. 8, <foreign lang="greek">khbos</foreign> is merely a monkeywith a tail; see also the account of Ælian, Anim. Nat. B. xvii. c. 8.—B.</p></body>
