<div2 type="chapter" n="46" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 46.—EGYPTIAN SILVER.</head><p>The people of Egypt stain their silver vessels, that theymay see represented in them their god Anubis;<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and it is thecustom with them to paint,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and not to chase, their silver.This usage has now passed to our own triumphal statues even;and, a truly marvellous fact, the value of silver has beenenhanced by deadening its brilliancy.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> The following is themethod adopted: with the silver are mixed two-thirds of thevery finest Cyprian copper, that known as "coronarium,"<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>and a proportion of live sulphur equal to that of the silver.The whole of these are then melted in an earthen vessel wellluted with potter's clay, the operation being completed whenthe cover becomes detached from the vessel. Silver admitsalso of being blackened with the yolk of a hard-boiled egg; atint, however, which is removed by the application of vinegarand chalk.</p><p>The Triumvir Antonius alloyed the silver denarius withiron: and in spurious coin there is an alloy of copper employed.Some, again, curtail<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> the proper weight of our denarii,the legitimate proportion being eighty-four denarii to apound of silver. It was in consequence of these frauds that amethod was devised of assaying the denarius: the law ordainingwhich was so much to the taste of the plebeians, that inevery quarter of the City there was a full-length statueerected<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> in honour of Marius Gratidianus. It is truly marvellous,that in this art, and in this only, the various methodsof falsification should be made a study:<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> for the sample of<pb n="6129" />the false denarius is now an object of careful examination,and people absolutely buy the counterfeit coin at the priceof many genuine ones!</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The dog-headed divinity.
