<div2 type="chapter" n="35" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 35.—LOCUSTS.</head><p>Those insects which have feet, move sideways. Some ofthem have the hind feet longer than the fore ones, and curvingoutwards, the locust, for example.</p><p>(29.) These creatures lay their eggs in large masses, in theautumn, thrusting the end of the tail into holes which theyform in the ground. These eggs remain undergroundthroughout the winter, and in the ensuing year, at the closeof spring, small locusts issue from them, of a black colour, andcrawling along without legs<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and wings. Hence it is that awet spring destroys their eggs, while, if it is dry, they multiply in great abundance. Some persons maintain that theybreed twice a year, and die the same number of times; thatthey bring forth at the rising<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> of the Vergiliæ, and die atthe rising of the Dog-star,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> after which others spring up in<pb n="3036" />their places: according to some, it is at the setting<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> ofArcturus that the second litter is produced. That the mothersdie the moment they have brought forth, is a well-known fact,for a little worm immediately grows about the throat, whichchokes them: at the same time, too, the males perish as well.This insect, which thus dies through a cause apparently sotrifling, is able to kill a serpent by itself, when it pleases, byseizing its jaws with its teeth.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> Locusts are only produced inchampaign places, that are full of chinks and crannies. InIndia, it is said that they attain the length of three<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> feet, andthat the people dry the legs and thighs, and use them for saws.There is another mode, also, in which these creatures perish;the winds carry them off in vast swarms, upon which they fallinto the sea or standing waters, and not, as the ancients supposed, because their wings have been drenched by the dampness of the night. The same authors have also stated, thatthey are unable to fly during the night, in consequence of thecold, being ignorant of the fact, that they travel over lengthenedtracts of sea for many days together, a thing the more to be wondered at, as they have to endure hunger all the time as well, forthis it is which causes them to be thus seeking pastures in otherlands. This is looked upon as a plague<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> inflicted by the angerof the gods; for as they fly they appear to be larger than theyreally are, while they make such a loud noise with their wings,that they might be readily supposed to be winged creatures ofquite another species. Their numbers, too, are so vast, that theyquite darken the sun; while the people below are anxiouslyfollowing them with the eye, to see if they are about to makea descent, and so cover their lands. After all, they havethe requisite energies for their flight; and, as though it hadbeen but a trifling matter to pass over the seas, they cross immense tracts of country, and cover them in clouds which bodedestruction to the harvests. Scorching numerous objects bytheir very contact, they eat away everything with their teeth,the very doors of the houses even.<pb n="3037" /></p><p>Those from Africa are the ones which chiefly devastateItaly; and more than once the Roman people have been obligedto have recourse to the Sibylline Books, to learn what remediesto employ under their existing apprehensions of impendingfamine. In the territory of Cyrenaica<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> there is a law, whicheven compels the people to make war, three times a year,against the locusts, first, by crushing their eggs, next by killing the young, and last of all by killing those of full growth;and he who fails to do so, incurs the penalty of being treatedas a deserter. In the island of Lemnos also, there is a certainmeasure fixed by law, which each individual is bound to fillwith locusts which he has killed, and then bring it to themagistrates. It is for this reason, too, that they pay such respectto the jack-daw, which flies to meet the locusts, and kills themin great numbers. In Syria, also, the people are placed undermartial law, and compelled to kill them: in so many countriesdoes this dreadful pest prevail. The Parthians look uponthem as a choice food,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> and the grasshopper as well. The voiceof the locust appears to proceed from the back part of the head.It is generally believed that in this place, where the shouldersjoin on to the body, they have, as it were, a kind of teeth, andthat it is by grinding these against each other that they produce the harsh noise which they make. It is more especiallyabout the two equinoxes that they are to be heard, in thesame way that we hear the chirrup of the grasshopper aboutthe summer solstice. The coupling of locusts is similar tothat of all other insects that couple, the female supportingthe male, and turning back the extremity of the tail towardshim; it is only after a considerable time that they separate.In all these kinds of insects the male is of smaller size thanthe female.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is not true that the young locusts are destitute of feet.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">7th May.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">18th July.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">11th May.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier treats this story as purely imaginary.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier says that some have been known nearly a foot long, but notmore.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He alludes to the ravages committed by the swarms of the migratorylocust, Grillus migratorius of Linuæus.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Julius Obsequens speaks of a pestilence there, created by the deadbodies of the locusts, which caused the death of 8000 persons.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See also B. vi. c. 35.</p></body>
