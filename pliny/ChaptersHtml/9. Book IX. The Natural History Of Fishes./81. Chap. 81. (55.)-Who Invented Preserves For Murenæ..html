Hirrus<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> was the first person who formed preserves forthe murena; and it was he who lent six thousand of thesefishes for the triumphal banquets of C¾sar the Dictator; onwhich occasion he had them duly weighed, as he declined toreceive the value of them in money or any other commodity.His villa, which was of a very humble character in the interior,sold for four millions<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> of sesterces, in consequence of the valuable nature of the stock-ponds there. Next after this, therearose a passion for individual fish. At Bauli,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> in the territory<pb n="2470" />of Bai¾, the orator Hortensius had some fish-preserves, inwhich there was a murena to which he became so much attached, as to be supposed to have wept on hearing of itsdeath.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> It was at the same villa that Antonia,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> the wife ofDrusus, placed earrings upon a murena which she had becomefond of; the report of which singular circumstance attractedmany visitors to the place.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably the same person as the C.
