<div2 type="chapter" n="73" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 73.—TE VEINS AND FIBRES OF TREES.</head><p>In the flesh of some trees we find both fibres<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and veins:they are easily distinguished. The veins<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> are larger, whilethe fibres are of whiter material, and are to be found in thosewoods more particularly which are easily split. Hence it is thatif the ear is applied to the extremity of a beam of wood, however long, a tap with a graver<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> even upon the other end maybe distinctly heard, the sound penetrating by the passageswhich run straight through it: by these means it is that weascertain whether timber runs awry, or is interrupted by knots.The tuberosities which we find on trees resemble the kernels<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>that are formed in flesh: they contain neither veins nor fibres,but only a kind of tough, solid flesh, rolled up in a sort ofball: it is these tuberosities that are the most esteemed parts<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>in the citrus and the maple. As to the other kinds of wood<pb n="3414" />which are employed for making tables, the trees are split intoplanks lengthwise, and the parts are then selected along whichthe fibres run, and properly rounded; for the wood would betoo brittle to use if it were cut in segments crosswise.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> inthe beech, the grain of the fibrous part runs crosswise;<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> henceit is that the ancients held in such high esteem all vessels madewith the wood of it. Manius Curius made oath, on one occasion, that he had not touched an article of all the spoil excepta single oil cruet<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> of beech, to use for sacrificing. Woodis always put lengthwise into the water to season, as that partwhich was nearest the root will sink to a greater<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> depth thanthe other. In some wood there is fibre, without veins, and merelyconsisting of filaments slightly knit together: wood of thisnature is remarkably fissile. Other wood, again, is more easilybroken across than split, such as the wood of those trees thathave no fibre, the olive and the vine, for instance: on the otherhand, in the fig-tree, the whole of the body consists of flesh.<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>The holm-oak, the cornel, the robur, the cytisus, the mulberry,the ebony, the lotus, and the other trees which we havementioned<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> as being destitute of marrow, consist entirely ofbone.<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> All these woods are of a blackish colour, with theexception of the cornel, of which glossy yellow hunting-spearsare made, marked with incisions for their further embellishment. In the cedar, the juniper, and the larch, the woodis red.</p><p>(39.) In Greece the female larch furnishes a wood<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> whichis known as ægis, and is just the colour of honey. This woodhas been found to be proof against decay, and forms the pannelsused by painters, being never known to gape or split; theportion thus employed is that which lies nearest to the pith. Inthe fir-tree this part is called "leuson" by the Greeks. In thecedar, too, the hardest part is the wood that lies nearest to the<pb n="3415" />sap: after the slimys<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> pith has been carefully removed, it hasa similar degree of hardness to the bones in the bodies ofanimals. It is said, too, that in Greece the inner part of theelder is remarkably firm: indeed, those whose business it is tomake hunting spears, prefer this material to all others, it beinga wood composed wholly of skin and bone.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Pulpæ."
