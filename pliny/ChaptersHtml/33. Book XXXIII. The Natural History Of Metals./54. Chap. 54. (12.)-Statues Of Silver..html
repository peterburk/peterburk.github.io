(12.)—STATUES OF SILVER.</head><p>It is generally believed, but erroneously, that silver was<pb n="6137" />first employed for making statues of the deified EmperorAugustus, at a period when adulation was all the fashion:for I find it stated, that in the triumph celebrated by PompeiusMagnus there was a silver statue exhibited of Pharnaces, thefirst<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> king of Pontus, as also one of Mithridates Eupator,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>besides chariots of gold and silver.</p><p>Silver, too, has in some instances even supplanted gold; forthe luxurious tastes of the female plebeians having gone so faras to adopt the use of shoe-buckles of gold,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> it is considered old-fashionedto wear them made of that metal.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> I myself, too,have seen Arellius Fuscus<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>—the person whose name was erasedfrom the equestrian order on a singularly calumnious charge,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>when his school was so thronged by our youth, attractedthither by his celebrity—wearing rings made of silver. Butof what use is it to collect all these instances, when our verysoldiers, holding ivory even in contempt, have the hilts oftheir swords made of chased silver? when, too, their scabbardsare heard to jingle with their silver chains, and their beltswith the plates of silver with which they are inlaid?</p><p>At the present day, too, the continence of our very pages issecured by the aid of silver:<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> our women, when bathing,quite despise any sitting-bath that is not made of silver:while for serving up food at table, as well as for the mostunseemly purposes, the same metal must be equally employed!Would that Fabricius could behold these instances of luxuriousness,the baths of our women—bathing as they do in<pb n="6138" />company with the men—paved with silver to such an extentthat there is not room left for the sole of the foot even!Fabricius, I say, who would allow of no general of an armyhaving any other plate than a patera and a salt-cellar of silver.—Oh that he could see how that the rewards of valour in ourday are either composed of these objects of luxury, or elseare broken up to make them!<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> Alas for the morals of ourage! Fabricius puts us to the blush.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Meaning the first king of that name.

We will, therefore,subjoin that of Holland, who adopts the other version. "As wemay see by our proud and sumptuous dames, that are but commoners andartizans' wives, who are forced to make themselves carquans and such ornamentsfor their shoes, of silver, because the rigour of the statute providedin that case will not permit them to weare the same of gold."</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A rhetorician who taught at Rome in the reign of Augustus.
