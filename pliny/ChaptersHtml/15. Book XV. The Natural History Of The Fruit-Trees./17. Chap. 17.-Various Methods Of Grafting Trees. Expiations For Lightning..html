<div2 type="chapter" n="17" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 17.â€”VARIOUS METHODS OF GRAFTING TREES. EXPIATIONS FOR LIGHTNING.</head><p>This branch of civilized life has long since been brought tothe very highest pitch of perfection, for man has left nothinguntried here. Hence it is that we find Virgil<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> speaking ofgrafting the nut-tree on the arbutus, the apple on the plane,and the cherry on the elm. Indeed, there is nothing furtherin this department that can possibly be devised, and it is along time since any new variety of fruit has been discovered.Religious scruples, too, will not allow of indiscriminate grafting; thus, for instance, it is not permitted to graft upon thethorn, for it is not easy, by any mode of expiation, to avoidthe disastrous effects of lightning; and we are told<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> that asmany as are the kinds of trees that have been engrafted on thethorn, so many are the thunderbolts that will be hurled againstthat spot in a single flash.</p><p>The form of the pear is turbinated; the later kinds remainon the parent tree till winter, when they ripen with the frost;such, for instance, as the Greek variety, the ampullaceum, andthe laureum; the same, too, with apples of the Amerinianand the Scandian kinds. Apples and pears are prepared for<pb n="3303" />keeping just like grapes, and in as many different ways; but,with the exception of plums, they are the only fruit that arestored in casks.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> Apples and pears have certain vinous<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>properties, and like wine these drinks are forbidden to invalids bythe physicians. These fruits are sometimes boiled up with wineand water, and, so make a preserve<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> that is eaten with bread;a preparation which is never made of any other fruit, with theexception of the quinces, known as the "cotoneum" and the"strutheum."</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Georgics, ii. 69. This statement of Virgil must be regarded as fabu-lous; grafting being impracticable with trees not of the same family, andnot always successful even then.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This was probably some superstition taught by the augurs for thepurpose of enveloping their profession in additional mystery and awe.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cadis.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He probably alludes here to cider and perry.
