<div2 type="chapter" n="50" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 50. (21.)—THE METHODS OF HARROWING, STUBBING, ANDHOEING, EMPLOYED FOR EACH DESCRIPTION OF GRAIN. THEUSE OF THE HARROW.</head><p>For winter wheat, spelt, wheat, zea,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and barley, harrow,hoe and stub upon the days which will be mentioned<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> in thesequel. A single hand per jugerum will be quite enough forany one of these kinds of grain. The operation of hoeingloosens the ground in spring when it has been hardened andsaddened by the rigours of the winter, and admits the earlysun to the interior. In hoeing, every care must be taken notto go beneath the roots of the corn; in the case of wheat, zea,and barley, it is best to give a couple of hoeings. Stubbing,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>when the crop is just beginning to joint, cleanses it of allnoxious weeds, disengages the roots of the corn, and liberatesthe growing blade from the clods. Among the leguminousplants, the chick-pea requires the same treatment that speltdoes. The bean requires no stubbing, being quite able of itselfto overpower all weeds; the lupine, too, is harrowed only.Millet and panic are both harrowed and hoed; but this operation isnever repeated, and they do not require stubbing.Fenugreek and the kidney-bean require harrowing only.</p><p>There are some kinds of ground, the extreme fertility ofwhich obliges the grower to comb down the crops while in theblade—this is done with a sort of harrow<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> armed with pointediron teeth—and even then he is obliged to depasture cattle uponthem. When, however, the blade has been thus eaten down,it stands in need of hoeing to restore it to its former vigour.</p><p>But in Bactria, and at Cyrenæ in Africa, all this trouble hasbeen rendered quite unnecessary by the indulgent benignity ofthe climate, and after the seed is in, the owner has no occasionto return to the field till the time has come for getting in theharvest. In those parts the natural dryness of the soil preventsnoxious weeds from springing up, and, aided by the night dewsalone, the soil supplies its nutriment to the grain. Virgil<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>recommends that the ground should be left to enjoy repose everyother year; and this, no doubt, if the extent of the farm willadmit of it, is the most advantageous plan. If, however, cir-<pb n="4067" />cumstances will not allow of it, spelt should be sown upon theground that has been first cropped with lupines, vetches, orbeans; for all these have a tendency to make the soil morefertile. We ought to remark here more particularly, that hereand there certain plants are sown for the benefit of others,although, as already stated in the preceding Book,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> not torepeat the same thing over again, they are of little valuethemselves. But it is the nature of each soil that is of the greatestimportance.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Semen," "seed-wheat," a variety only of spelt.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In c. 65 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Runcatio.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Crates.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Georg. i. 71.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. xvii. c. 7.</p></body>
