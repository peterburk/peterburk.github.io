<div2 type="chapter" n="106" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 106. (103.)ÑTHE WONDERS OF FOUNTAINS ANDRIVERS.</head><p>It is very remarkable that fresh water should burst outclose to the sea, as from pipes. But there is no end to thewonders that are connected with the nature of waters. Freshwater floats on sea water, no doubt from its being lighter;and therefore sea water, which is of a heavier nature<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>, supports better what floats uponit. And, in some places,different kinds of fresh water float upon each other; as thatof the river which falls into the Fucinus; that of the Adduainto the Larius; of the Ticinus into the Verbanus; of theMincius into the Benacus; of the Ollius into the Sevinus;and of the Rhone into the Leman lake<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> (this last beingbeyond the Alps, the others in Italy): all which rivers passingthrough the lakes for many miles, generally carry off no morewater than they bring with them. The same thing is said tooccur in the Orontes, a river of Syria, and in many others</p><p>Some rivers, from a real hatred of the sea, pass under it,as does Arethusa, a fountain of Syracuse, in which the substances are found thatare thrown into the Alpheus; which,after flowing by Olympia, is discharged into the sea, on theshore of the Peloponnesus<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>. TheLycus in Asia<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, theEra-<pb n="1132" />sinus in Argolis, and the Tigris<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> in Mesopotamia, sink into theearth and burst out again. Substances which are throwninto the fountain of ®sculapius at Athens<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> are cast up atthe fountain of Phalerum. The river which sinks into theground in the plain of Atinum<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> comes up again at thedistance of twenty miles, and the Timavus does the samein Aquileia<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>.</p><p>In the lake Asphaltites, in Jud¾a, which produces bitumen,no substance will sink, nor in the lake Arethusa<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>, in theGreater Armenia: in this lake, although it contains nitre,fish are found. In the country of the Salentini, near thetown of Manduria, there is a lake<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> full to the brim, thewaters of which are never diminished by what is taken outof it, nor increased by what is added. Wood, which isthrown into the river of the Cicones<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>, or into the lake Velinusin Picenum, becomes coated with a stony crust, while in theSurius, a river of Colchis, the whole substance becomes ashard as stone. In the same manner, in the Silarus<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>, beyond<pb n="1133" />Surrentum, not only twigs which are immersed in it, butlikewise leaves are petrified; the water at the same timebeing proper for drinking. In the stream which runs fromthe marsh of Reate<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> there is a rock, which continues toincrease in size, and in the Red Sea olive-trees and greenshrubs are produced<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>.</p><p>There are many springs which are remarkable for theirwarmth. This is the case even among the ridges of theAlps<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>, and in the sea itself, between Italy and ®naria, as inthe bay of Bai¾, and in the Liris and many other rivers<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span>.There are many places in which fresh water may be procuredfrom the sea, as at the Chelidonian Isles, and at Arados, andin the ocean at Gades. Green plants are produced in thewarm springs of Padua, frogs in those of Pisa, and fish inthose of Vetulonia in Etruria, which is not far from the sea.In Casinas there is a cold river called Scatebra, which in summer is more fullof water<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span>. In this, as in the river Stymphalis,in Arcadia, small water-mice are produced. The fountainof Jupiter in Dodona, although it is as cold as ice, andextinguishes torches that are plunged into it, yet, if they bebrought near it, it kindles them again<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span>. This spring alwaysbecomes dry at noon, from which circumstance it is called<pb n="1134" /><foreign lang="greek">Anapauo/menon</foreign><span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> it then increases and becomes full at midnight, after which it againvisibly decreases. In Illyricumthere is a cold spring, over which if garments are spreadthey take fire. The pool of Jupiter Ammon, which is coldduring the day, is warm during the night<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span>. In the countryof the Troglodyt¾<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span>, what they call the Fountain of the Sun,about noon is fresh and very cold; it then gradually growswarm, and, at midnight, becomes hot and saline<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span>.</p><p>In the middle of the day, during summer, the source ofthe Po, as if reposing itself, is always dry<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span>. In the islandof Tenedos there is a spring, which, after the summer solstice, is full ofwater, from the third hour of the night tothe sixth<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span>. The fountain Inopus, in the island of Delos,decreases and increases in the same manner as the Nile,and also at the same periods<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span>. There is a small island inthe sea, opposite to the river Timavus, containing warm<pb n="1135" />springs, which increase and decrease at the same time withthe tides of the sea<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span>. In the territory of Pitinum, on theother side of the Apennines, the river Novanus, whichduring the solstice is quite a torrent, is dry in the winter<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span>.</p><p>In Faliscum, all the water which the oxen drink turnsthem white; in BÏotia, the river Melas turns the sheepblack; the Cephissus, which flows out of a lake of the samename, turns them white<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span>; again, the Peneus turns themblack, and the Xanthus, near Ilium, makes them red, whencethe river derives its name<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span>. In Pontus, the river Astaceswaters certain plains, where the mares give black milk, whichthe people use in diet. In Reate there is a spring calledNeminia, which rises up sometimes in one place and sometimesin another, and in this way indicates a change in the produceof the earth<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span>. There is a spring in the harbour of Brundisiumthat yields water which never becomes putrid at sea. Thewater of the Lyncestis, which is said to be acidulous, intoxicates likewine<span id="ref_31"><a href="#note_31">[31]</a></span>; this is the case also in Paphlagonia<span id="ref_32"><a href="#note_32">[32]</a></span> and inthe territory of Calenum<span id="ref_33"><a href="#note_33">[33]</a></span>. In the island of Andros,at thetemple of Father Bacchus, we are assured by Mucianus,who was thrice consul, that there is a spring, which, on thenones of January, always has the flavour of wine; it is called<pb n="1136" /><foreign lang="greek">Dio\s Qeodosi/a</foreign><span id="ref_34"><a href="#note_34">[34]</a></span>. Near Nonacris, in Arcadia, the Styx<span id="ref_35"><a href="#note_35">[35]</a></span>, whichis not unlike it either in odour or in colour, instantly destroys those whodrink it. Also in Librosus, a hill in thecountry of the Tauri, there are three springs which inevitably produce death,but without pain. In the territoryof the Carrinenses in Spain<span id="ref_36"><a href="#note_36">[36]</a></span>, two springs burst out closetogether, the one of which absorbs everything, the otherthrows them out. In the same country there is anotherspring, which gives to all the fish the appearance of gold,although, when out of the water, they do not differ in anyrespect from other fish. In the territory of Como, near theLarian lake, there is a copious spring, which always swellsup and subsides again every hour<span id="ref_37"><a href="#note_37">[37]</a></span>. In the island of Cydonea<span id="ref_38"><a href="#note_38">[38]</a></span>, before Lesbos, there is a warm fountain, which flowsonly during the spring season. The lake Sinnaus<span id="ref_39"><a href="#note_39">[39]</a></span>, in Asia,is impregnated with wormwood, which grows about it. AtColophon, in the cave of the Clarian Apollo, there is a pool,by the drinking of which a power is acquired of utteringwonderful oracles; but the lives of those who drink of it areshortened<span id="ref_40"><a href="#note_40">[40]</a></span>. In our own times, during the last years ofNero's life, we have seen rivers flowing backwards, as I havestated in my history of his times<span id="ref_41"><a href="#note_41">[41]</a></span>.</p><p>And indeed who can be mistaken as to the fact, that allsprings are colder in summer than in winter<span id="ref_42"><a href="#note_42">[42]</a></span>, as well as<pb n="1137" />these other wonderful operations of nature; that copper andlead sink when in a mass, but float when spread out<span id="ref_43"><a href="#note_43">[43]</a></span>; andof things that are equally heavy, some will sink to the bottom, while otherswill remain on the surface<span id="ref_44"><a href="#note_44">[44]</a></span>; that heavybodies are more easily moved in water<span id="ref_45"><a href="#note_45">[45]</a></span>; that a stone fromScyros, although very large, will float, while the same, whenbroken into small pieces, sinks<span id="ref_46"><a href="#note_46">[46]</a></span>; that the body of an animal,newly deprived of life, sinks, but that, when it is swelledout, it floats<span id="ref_47"><a href="#note_47">[47]</a></span>; that empty vessels are drawn out of the waterwith no more ease than those that are full<span id="ref_48"><a href="#note_48">[48]</a></span>; that rain-wateris more useful for salt-pits than other kinds of water<span id="ref_49"><a href="#note_49">[49]</a></span>;that salt cannot be made, unless it is mixed with fresh water<span id="ref_50"><a href="#note_50">[50]</a></span>;that salt water freezes with more difficulty<span id="ref_51"><a href="#note_51">[51]</a></span>, and is more readilyheated<span id="ref_52"><a href="#note_52">[52]</a></span>; that the sea is warmer in winter<span id="ref_53"><a href="#note_53">[53]</a></span> and more saltin<pb n="1138" />the autumn<span id="ref_54"><a href="#note_54">[54]</a></span>; that everything is soothed by oil, and thatthis is the reason why divers send out small quantities of itfrom their mouths, because it smoothes any part which isrough<span id="ref_55"><a href="#note_55">[55]</a></span> and transmits the light to them; that snow neverfalls in the deep part of the sea<span id="ref_56"><a href="#note_56">[56]</a></span>; that although water generally has a tendency downwards, fountains riseup<span id="ref_57"><a href="#note_57">[57]</a></span>, and thatthis is the case even at the foot of ®tna<span id="ref_58"><a href="#note_58">[58]</a></span>, burning as it does,so as to force out the sand like a ball of flame to the distanceof 150 miles?</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The specific gravityof sea water varies from 1cú0269 to 1cú0285. Thesaline contents of the water of the English Channel are stated to be 27 grs.in 1000. Turner's Chem. p. 1289, 1290.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The modern names of the rivers andlakes here mentioned are theLiris, communicating with the Lago di Celano; the Adda, with the Lagodi Como; the Ticino, with the Lago Maggiore; the Mincio, with theLago di Guarda; the Oglio, with the Lago di Sero; and the Rhone withthe Lake of Geneva. There may be some foundation for the alleged fact,because the specific gravity and the temperature of the lake may differ alittle from that of the river which passes through it.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">According to Brotier, "fons ille olimnobilissimus, nunc ignobileest lavacrum, cujus aqua marino sapore inficitur." He conceives thatthere is no actual foundation for this so frequently repeated story; andconjectures that it originated from the similitude of the names, thefountain in Sicily and the river in the Peloponnesus being both namedAlpheus. He goes on to mention some examples of springs of freshwater rising up on the sea-coast; Lemaire, i. 438. The allusion to thefountain of Arethusa, by Virgil, in the commencement of the 10th eclogue,is well known to all classical scholars. The lines of Virgil have beenelegantly imitated by Voltaire, in the Henriade, ix. 269, 270.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is mentioned by Ovid, Met. xv. 273, 274.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is again referred to by our author,vi. 31; also by Strabo, andby Seneca, Nat.

We maypresume that the water contained some saline, earthy or metallic substance,either in solution, or in a state of minute division, which would producethese effects. It does not appear that anything of this kind has beenobserved by the moderns in this water.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The coral beds with which the Red Sea abounds may havegivenrise to this opinion: see the remarks of Alexandre <hi rend="ital">in loco.</hi> Hardouininforms us, that this clause respecting the Red Sea is not found in anyof the MSS.

We learn from Tournefort, that there is a well of thisname in Delos, which he found to contain considerably more water inJanuary and February than in October, and which is supposed to be connected withthe Nile or the Jordan: this, of course, he regards as an idletale.

Lemaire.</p><p><span id="note_27"><a href="#ref_27">27. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">According toHardouin this is the modern Torre di Pitino; he conceives that the river herementioned must be the Vomanus.

We can scarcely suppose that by this term ourauthor intended to express the actual burning or inflaming of the water,which is its literal and ordinary meaning. This, however, would appearto be the opinion of Hardouin and Alexandre; Lemaire, i. 449. Hollandtranslates it, "made hot and set a-seething," i. 46; Poinsinet, "s'Žhauffele plus v”te," i. 313; and Ajasson, "plus prompte ˆ s'Žchauffer," ii.217.</p><p><span id="note_53"><a href="#ref_53">53. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The temperature of the ocean, inconsequence of its great mass andthe easy diffusion and mixture of its various parts, may be conceived to belonger in becoming raised or depressed than any particular portionof the land, where contemporary observations may be made.</p><p><span id="note_54"><a href="#ref_54">54. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The evaporation that is going on during the heats of summer, andthe heavy rains which in many countries fall during the autumn, mayproduce the effects here described, in confined seas or inlets.</p><p><span id="note_55"><a href="#ref_55">55. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The statement is true to a certain extent, as is proved by thewell-known experiments of Franklin and others; but the degree of the effectis considerably exaggerated.
