<div2 type="chapter" n="4" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 4. (6.)—THE EIGHT KINDS OF EARTH BOASTED OF BY THEGAULS AND GREEKS.</head><p>There is another method, which has been invented both in<pb n="3453" />Gaul and Britain, of enriching earth by the agency of itself,being * * * * and that kind known as marl.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> Thissoil is looked upon as containing a greater amount of fecundating principles, and acts as a fat in relation to the earth, justas we find glands existing in the body, which are formed by acondensation of the fatty particles into so many kernels.(7.) This mode of proceeding, too, has not been overlooked bythe Greeks; indeed, what subject is there that they have nottouched upon? They call by the name of leucargillon<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> awhite argillaceous earth which is used in the territory ofMegara, but only where the soil is of a moist, cold nature.</p><p>It is only right that I should employ some degree of careand exactness in treating of this marl, which tends so greatlyto enrich the soil of the Gallic provinces and the British islands.There were formerly but two varieties known, but more recently, with the progress of agricultural knowledge, several<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>others have begun to be employed; there being, in fact, thewhite, the red, the columbine, the argillaceous, the tufaceous,and the sandy marls. It has also one of these two peculiarities, it is either rough or greasy to the touch; the propermode of testing it being by the hand. Its uses, too, are of atwofold nature—it is employed for the production of thecereals only, or else for the enrichment of pasture land aswell. The tufaceous<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> kind is nutrimental to grain, and sois the white; if found in the vicinity of springs, it is fertileto an immeasurable extent; but if it is rough to the touch,when laid upon the land in too large a quantity, it is apt toburn up the soil. The next kind is the red marl, known asacaunumarga,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> consisting of stones mingled with a thin sandy<pb n="3454" />earth. These stones are broken upon the land itself, and it iswith considerable difficulty during the earlier years that thestalk of the corn is cut, in consequence of the presence of thesestones; however, as it is remarkably light, it only costs forcarriage one-half of the outlay required in using the othervarieties. It is laid but very thinly on the surface, and it isgenerally thought that it is mixed with salt. Both of thesevarieties, when once laid on the land, will fertilize it forfifty<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> years, whether for grain or for hay.(8.) Of the marls that are found to be of an unctuous na-ture, the best is the white. There are several varieties of it:the most pungent and biting being the one already mentioned.Another kind is the white chalk that is used for cleaning<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>silver; it is taken from a considerable depth in the ground,the pits being sunk, in most instances, as much as one hundredfeet. These pits are narrow at the mouth, but the shafts enlarge very considerably in the interior, as is the case in mines;it is in Britain more particularly that this chalk is employed.The good effects of it are found to last full eighty years; andthere is no instance known of an agriculturist laying it twiceon the same land during his life.<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> A third variety of whitemarl is known as glisomarga;<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> it consists of fullers' chalk <span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>mixed with an unctuous earth, and is better for promoting thegrowth of hay than grain; so much so, in fact, that betweenharvest and the ensuing seed-time there is cut a most abundantcrop of grass. While the corn is growing, however, it willallow no other plant to grow there. Its effects will last solong as thirty years; but if laid too thickly on the ground, itis apt to choke up the soil, just as if it had been covered withSignine<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> cement. The Gauls give to the columbine marl in<pb n="3455" />their language the name of eglecopala;<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> it is taken up insolid blocks like stone, after which it is so loosened by theaction of the sun and frost, as to split into laminæ of extremethinness; this kind is equally beneficial for grass and grain.The sandy<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> marl is employed if there is no other at hand, andon moist slimy soils, even when other kinds can be procured.</p><p>The Ubii are the only people that we know of, who, havingan extremely fertile soil to cultivate, employ methods of enriching it; wherever the land may happen to be, they dig toa depth of three feet, and, taking up the earth, cover the soilwith it in other places a foot in thickness; this method, however, to be beneficial, requires to be renewed at the end ofevery ten years. The Ædui and the Pictones have renderedtheir lands remarkably fertile by the aid of limestone, whichis also found to be particularly beneficial to the olive and thevine.<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> Every marl, however, requires to be laid on the landimmediately after ploughing, in order that the soil may atonce imbibe its properties; while at the same time, it requiresa little manure as well, as it is apt, at first, to be of too acrida nature, at least where it is not pasture land that it is laidupon; in addition to which, by its very freshness it may possibly injure the soil, whatever the nature of it may be; somuch so, indeed, that the land is never fertile the first yearafter it has been employed. It is a matter of considerationalso for what kind of soil the marl is required; if the soil ismoist, a dry marl is best suited for it; and if dry, a richunctuous marl. If, on the other hand, the land is of a mediumquality, chalk or columbine<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> marl is the best suited for it.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A natural mixture of argilla and calcareous stones, or subcarbonate ofchalk. Fée remarks, that the ancients were not acquainted with theproper method of applying it. Marl only exercises its fertilizing influenceafter being reduced to dust by the action of the atmosphere, by absorbingthe oxygen of the air, and giving to vegetation the carbonic acid that isnecessary for their nourishment.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"White argilla." This, Fée thinks, is the calcareous marl, threevarieties of which are known, the compact, the schistoid, and the friable.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">At the present day there are only two varieties of marl recognized, theargillaceous and the calcareous; it is to the latter, Fée thinks, that thevarieties here mentioned as anciently recognized, belonged.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Marga terrea of Linnæus. It abounds in various parts ofEurope.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From the Greek, meaning "not bitter marl."</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Marl does not begin to fertilize till several years after it has been laiddown; hence, it is generally recommended to marl the land a little at atime, and often. If the ground is fully marled, it requires to be marledafresh in about eight or ten years, and not fifty, as Pliny says.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Argentaria." Used, probably, in the same way as whitening inmodem times. See B. xxxv. c. 58.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">An exaggeration, no doubt.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably meaning "smooth marl;" a variety, Fée thinks, of argillaceous marl, and, perhaps, the potter's argillaceous marl, or potter's argil.He suggests, also that it may have possibly been the Marga fullonumsaponacea lamellosa of Valerius; in other words, fullers' earth.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Creta fullonia.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxxv. c. 46.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This would rather seem to be a name borrowed from the Greek,<foreign lang="greek">a)iglh/eis,</foreign> "shining," and <foreign lang="greek">pelio\s,</foreign> "white." Notwithstanding the resemblance, however, it is just possible that it may have been derived fromthe Gallic. Fée queries whether this is the schistoid calcareous marl, orthe schistoid argillaceous marl, the laminæ of which divide with great facility, and the varieties of which display many colours.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A variety of the terreous marl.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It has the effect of augmenting their fruitfulness, and amelioratingthe quality of the fruit. Lime is still considered an excellent improver forstrong, humid soils.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From this passage, Fée thinks that the Columbine marl must havebeen of the white, slightly sparkling kind.</p></body>
