(44.)ÑRESEMBLANCE OF THE APE TO MAN.</head><p>As to the various kinds of apes, they offer a perfect resem-<pb n="3087" />blance to man in the face, the nostrils, the ears, and the eyelids; being the only quadrupeds, in fact, that have eyelashes onthe lower eyelid. They have mamm¾ also on the breast, armsand legs, which bend in opposite directions, and nails uponthe hands and fingers, the middle finger being the longest.They differ somewhat from man in the feet; which, like thehands, are of remarkable length, and have a print similar tothat of the palm of our hand. They have a thumb also, andarticulations similar to those in man. The males differ fromman in the sexual parts only, while all the internal visceraexactly resemble those of man.</p></div2></body>
