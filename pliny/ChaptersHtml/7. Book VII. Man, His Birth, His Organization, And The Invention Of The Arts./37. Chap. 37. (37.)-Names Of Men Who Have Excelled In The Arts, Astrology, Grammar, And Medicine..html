<div2 type="chapter" n="37" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 37. (37.)—NAMES OF MEN WHO HAVE EXCELLED IN THE ARTS, ASTROLOGY, GRAMMAR, AND MEDICINE.</head><p>Innumerable are the men who have excelled in the variousarts; we may, however, take a cursory survey of them, byciting the names of the principal ones. Berosus excelled inastrology; and on account of his divinations and predictions,a public statue was erected in his honour by the Athenians.Apollodorus, for his skill as a grammarian, had public honoursdecreed him by the Amphictyonic Council of Greece. Hip-pocrates excelled in medicine; before its arrival, he predicted the plague, which afterwards came from Illyria, andsent his pupils to various cities, to give their assistance.As an acknowledgment of his merit, Greece decreed him thesame honours as to Hercules.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> King Ptolemy rewarded asimilar degree of skill in the person of Cleombrotus of Ceos,by a donation of one hundred talents, at the Megalensiangames,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> he having succeeded in saving the life of King Anti-ochus.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> Critobulus also rendered himself extremely famous,by extracting an arrow<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> from the eye of King Philip with so<pb n="2183" />much skill, that, although the sight was lost, there was nodefect to be seen.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> Asclepiades of Prusa, however, acquiredthe greatest fame of all—he founded a new sect, treated withdisdain the promises of King Mithridates conveyed to himby an embassy, discovered a method of successfully treatingdiseases by wine,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> and, breaking in upon the funeral ceremony,saved the life of a man, who was actually placed<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> on the funeral pile. He rendered himself, however, more celebrated thanall, by staking his reputation as a physician against Fortuneherself, and asserting that he did not wish to be so much aslooked upon as a physician, if he should ever happen in anyway to fall sick; and he won his wager, for he met his deathat an extreme old age, by falling down stairs.<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny again speaks of the great talents of Hippocrates, B. xxvi. c. 6,and B. xxix. c. 2.—B.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We have an account of the origin of these games in Livy, B. xxix. c.14.—B.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cleombrotus is supposed to be the same person who is mentioned in B.xxix. c. 3, as Erasistratus, the grandson of Aristotle. From Suidas welearn that a near relative of his was called Cleombrotus, though, from hisperplexed language, it is impossible to say whether father or uncle. Thestory to which Pliny is supposed here to refer is a curious one. Antiochus, the son of Seleucus Nicator, fell in love with Stratonice, whom hisfather had married in his old age, but struggled to conceal his passion.The skilful physician discovered the nature of his disease; upon which hereported to Seleucus that it was incurable, for that he was in love, and itwas impossible that his passion could be gratified. The king, greatlysurprised, inquired who the lady was; to which Erasistratus replied thatit was his own wife; whereupon Seleucus began to try and persuade himto give her up to his son. The physician upon this asked him if he woulddo so himself, if it were his own wife. Seleucus declared that he would;upon which Erasistratus disclosed to him the truth. Seleucus not onlygave up Stratonice to his son, but resigned to him several provinces.Erasistratus was one of the most famous physicians and anatomists ofantiquity.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It was on this occasion that a label was said to have been fastened onthe arrow, inscribed, "To Philip's right eye." The inhabitants were permitted to depart, however, when the city was taken, with one garment toeach person.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This accident occurred to Philip, at the siege of Methone, of whichwe have a brief account in Diodorus Siculus, B. xvi. c. 7, and in Justin,B. vii. c. 6; but neither of these authors makes any mention of Critobulus.Quintus Curtius, B. ix. c. 5, informs us, that Critobulus exhibited great skillin relieving Alexander the Great from the effects of a dangerous wound,which he received in India; but he does not refer to the fact here mentioned.—B.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">At the present day, this mode of treatment would have figured as thewine-cure."</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxvi. c. 8.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny again speaks of Asclepiades, in B. xxvi. c. 7, and B. xxix. c. 5.The anecdote respecting the man who was saved from the funeral pile isreferred to by Celsus, B. ii. c. 6.—B. Pliny says, in B. xxvi. c. 7, thatAsclepiades first came to Rome as a teacher of rhetoric, and that being unsuccessful, he turned his attention to medicine. Bruce, the Abyssiniantraveller, also met his death by falling down stairs. Rabelais, in the prologue to his Fourth Book, refers to this peculiar death of Asclepiades.</p></body>
