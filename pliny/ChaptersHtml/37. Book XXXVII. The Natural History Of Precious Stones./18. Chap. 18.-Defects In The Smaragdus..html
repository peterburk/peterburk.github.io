<div2 type="chapter" n="18" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 18.—DEFECTS IN THE SMARAGDUS.</head><p>It will be only proper, too, seeing that the prices of thesestones are so exorbitant, to point out their defects. Somedefects, no doubt, are common to all of them, while others,again, like those found in the human race, are peculiar onlyto those of a certain country. Thus, for example, the stonesof Cyprus are not all green alike, and in the same smaragdussome parts are more or less so than others, the stone not alwayspreserving that uniform deep tint which characterizes the smaragdusof Scythia. In other instances, a shadow runs throughthe stone, and the colour becomes dulled thereby; the consequenceof which is, that its value is depreciated; and evenmore so, when the colour is thin and diluted.</p><p>In consequence of the defects<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> in these stones, they havebeen divided into several classes. Some of them are obscure,and are then known as "blind" stones; some have a certaindensity, which impairs their transparency; others, again, aremottled, and others covered with a cloud. This cloud, however,is altogether different from the shadow above mentioned;for it is a defect which renders the stone of a whitish hue, andnot of a transparent green throughout; presenting, as it does, inthe interior or upon the surface, a certain degree of whitenesswhich arrests the vision. Other defects, again, in these stones,are filaments, salt-like<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> grains, or traces of lead ore, faultswhich are mostly common to them all.</p><p>Next after the kinds above described, the smaragdus ofÆthiopia is held in high esteem; being found, as Juba tellsus, at a distance of twenty-five days' journey from Coptos.These are of a bright green, but are seldom to be met with perfectlyclear or of an uniform colour. Democritus includes inthis class the stones that are known as "herminei," and as"Persian" stones; the former of which are of a convex,<pb n="6412" />massive shape, while the latter are destitute of transparency,but have an agreeable, uniform colour, and satisfy the visionwithout allowing it to penetrate them; strongly resembling, inthis respect, the eyes of cats and of panthers, which are radiantwithout being diaphanous. In the sun, he says, they lose theirbrilliancy, but they are radiant in the shade, the brightness ofthem being seen at a greater distance than in the case of otherstones. One other fault, too, in all these stones is, that theyoften have a colour like that of honey or rancid oil, or elseare clear and transparent, but not green.</p><p>These defects exist in the smaragdi of Attica,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> more particularly,which are found in the silver-mines there, at a placeknown by the name of Thoricos.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> These last are never somassive as the others, and are always more pleasing to thesight when viewed from a distance: lead ore, too, is often tobe detected in them, or, in other words, they have a leadenappearance when looked at in the sun.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> One peculiarity inthem is, that some of them become impaired by age, graduallylose their green colour, and are even deteriorated by exposureto the sun. Next to the stones of Attica come those ofMedia, a variety which presents the most numerous tints of all,and sometimes approaches sapphiros<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> in colour. These stonesare wavy,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> and represent various natural objects, such aspoppy-heads, for example, birds, the young of animals, andfeathers: all of them appear naturally of a green colour, butbecome improved by the application of oil. No stones of thisspecies are of a larger size than these.</p><p>I am not aware that any of these stones<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> are still in existenceat Chalcedon, the copper mines of that locality being nowexhausted: but be this as it may, they were always the smallestin size and the most inferior in value. Brittle, and of a colour<pb n="6413" />far from distinctly pronounced, they resembled in their tintsthe feathers that are seen in the tail of the peacock or on thenecks of pigeons.<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> More or less brilliant, too, according to theangle at which they were viewed, they presented an appearancelike that of veins and scales. There was another defect, also,peculiar to these stones, known as "sarcion," from the circumstancethat a kind of flesh<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> appeared to attach itself to thestone. The mountain near Chalcedon, where these stones weregathered, is still known by the name of "Smaragdites." Jubainforms us that a kind of smaragdus, known as "cloras,"<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> isused in Arabia as an ornament for buildings, as also the stonewhich by the people of Egypt is called "alabastrites." On thesame authority, too, we learn that there are several varietiesof the smaragdus in the neighbouring mountains, and thatstones like those of Media are found in Mount Taygetus,<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> asalso in Sicily.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ajasson remarks that the greater part of the defects here describedbelong in reality to the Dioptase.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Sal."
