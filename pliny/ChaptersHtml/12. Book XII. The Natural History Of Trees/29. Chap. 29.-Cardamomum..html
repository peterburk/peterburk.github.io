It is gathered in the samemanner both in India and Arabia. There are four differentkinds of cardamomum. That which is of a very green colour,unctuous, with sharp angles, and very difficult to break, is themost highly esteemed of all. The next best is of a reddishwhite tint, while that of third-rate quality is shorter andblacker, the worst of all being mottled and friable, and emitting but little smell; which, in its genuine<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> state ought to bevery similar to costum. Cardamomum grows also in Media.The price of the best is three denarii per pound.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Still known in pharmacy as "cardamum." It is not, however, asPliny says, found in Arabia, but in India; from which it probably reachedthe Greeks and Romans by way of the Red Sea. There are three kindsknown in modern commerce, the large, the middle size, and the small.M. Bonastre, "Journal de Pharmacie," May, <date value="1828-05" authname="1828-05">1828</date>, is of opinion, that theword cardamomum signifies "amomum in pods," the Egyptian kardhmeaning "pod," or "husk." It is, however, more generally supposed,that the Greek word, <foreign lang="greek">kardi/a,</foreign> "heart," enters into its composition.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Verus" seems a preferable reading here to "vero," which has beenadopted by Sillig.</p></body>
