<div2 type="chapter" n="4" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 4.—THE SYRTES.</head><p>A third Gulf is divided into two smaller ones, those ofthe two Syrtes<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>, which are rendered perilous by the shallows<pb n="1392" />of their quicksands and the ebb and flow of the sea. Polybiusstates the distance from Carthage to the Lesser Syrtis,the one which is nearest to it, to be 300 miles. The inletto it he also states to be 100 miles across, and its circumference300. There is also a way<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> to it by land, to findwhich we must employ the guidance of the stars and crossdeserts which present nothing but sand and serpents. Afterpassing these we come to forests filled with vast multitudesof wild beasts and elephants, then desert wastes<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>, and beyondthem the Garamantes<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, distant twelve days' journey fromthe Augylæ<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>. Above the Garamantes was formerly the na-<pb n="1393" />tion of the Psylli<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>, and above them again the Lake of Lycomedes<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>,surrounded with deserts. The Augylæ themselvesare situate almost midway between Æthiopia which facesthe west<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>, and the region which lies between<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> the two Syrtes,at an equal distance from both. The distance along thecoast that lies between the two Syrtes is 250 miles. On itare found the city of Œa<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>, the river Cinyps<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>, and the countryof that name, the towns of Neapolis<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>, Graphara<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>, and Abrotonum<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>,and the second, surnamed the Greater, Leptis<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>.</p><p>We next come to the Greater Syrtis, 625 miles in circumference,and at the entrance 312 miles in width; nextafter which dwells the nation of the Cisippades. At thebottom of this gulf was the coast of the Lotophagi, whomsome writers have called the Alachroæ<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span>, extending as far asthe Altars of the Philæni<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span>; these Altars are formed of heaps<pb n="1394" />of sand. On passing these, not far from the shore there isa vast swamp<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> which receives the river Triton<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> and from ittakes its name: by Callimachus it is called Pallantias<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span>, andis said by him to be on the nearer side of the Lesser Syrtis;many other writers however place it between the two Syrtes.The promontory which bounds the Greater Syrtis has thename of Borion<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span>; beyond it is the province of Cyrene.</p><p>Africa, from the river Ampsaga to this limit, includes516 peoples, who are subject to the Roman sway, of whichsix are colonies; among them Uthina<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> and Tuburbi<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span>, besidesthose already mentioned. The towns enjoying therights of Roman citizens are fifteen in number, of whichI shall mention, as lying in the interior, those of Assuræ<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span>,Abutucum, Aborium, Canopicum<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span>, Cilma<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span>, Simithium, Thunusidium,Tuburnicum, Tynidrumum, Tibiga, the two townscalled Ucita, the Greater and the Lesser, and vaga. Thereis also one town with Latin rights, Uzalita by name, andone town of tributaries, Castra Cornelia<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span>. The free townsare thirty in number, among which we may mention, in theinterior, those of Acholla<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span>, Aggarita, Avina, Abzirita, Cano-<pb n="1395" />pita, Melizita, Matera, Salaphita, Tusdrita<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span>, Tiphica, Tunica<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span>,Theuda, Tagasta<span id="ref_31"><a href="#note_31">[31]</a></span>, Tiga<span id="ref_32"><a href="#note_32">[32]</a></span>, Ulusubrita, a second Vaga, Visa, andZama<span id="ref_33"><a href="#note_33">[33]</a></span>. Of the remaining number, most of them should becalled, in strictness, not only cities, but nations even; suchfor instance as the Natabudes, the Capsitani<span id="ref_34"><a href="#note_34">[34]</a></span>, the Musulami,the Sabarbares, the Massyli<span id="ref_35"><a href="#note_35">[35]</a></span>, the Nisives, the Vamacures,the Cinithi, the Musuni, the Marchubii<span id="ref_36"><a href="#note_36">[36]</a></span>, and the wholeof Gætulia<span id="ref_37"><a href="#note_37">[37]</a></span>, as far as the river Nigris<span id="ref_38"><a href="#note_38">[38]</a></span>, which separatesAfrica proper from Æthiopia.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Syrtes or 'Quicksands' are now called, the Lesser Syrtes the Gulf of Cabès, and the Greater the Gulf of Sydra. The country situate between the two Syrtes is called Tripoli, formerly Tripolis, a name which, according to Solinus, it owed to its three cities, Sabrata, Leptis, and Œa.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Marcus observes with reference to this passage, that both Hardouin and Poinsinet have mistaken its meaning. They evidently think that Pliny is speaking here of a route to the Syrtes leading from the interior of Africa, whereas it is pretty clear that he is speaking of the dangers which attend those who approach it by the line of the sea-coast, as Cato did, on his march to Utica, so beautifully described by Lucan in his Ninth Book. This is no doubt the same route which was taken by the caravans on their passage from Lebida, the ancient Leptis, to Berenice in Cyrenaica.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Those which we find at the middle of the coast bordering upon the Greater Syrtis, and which separate the mountains of Fezzan and Atlas from Cyrenaïca and Barca.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In its widest sense this name is applied to all the Libyan tribes inhabiting the Oases on the eastern part of the Great Desert, as the Gætulians inhabited its western part, the boundary between the two nations being drawn at the sources of the Bagrada and the mountain Usargala. In the stricter sense however, and in which the term must be here understood, the name 'Garamantes' denoted the people of Phazania, the modern Fezzan, which forms by far the largest oasis in the Grand Desert of Zahara.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Augylæ, now Aujelah, was an oasis in the desert of Barca, in the region of Cyrenaica, about 3 1/2° south of Cyrene. It has been remarked that Pliny, here and in the Eighth Chapter of the present Book, in abridging the account given by Herodotus of the tribes of Northern Africa, has transferred to the Augylæ what that author really says of the Nasamones. This oasis forms one of the chief stations on the caravan route from Cairo to Fezzan. It is placed by Rennell in 30°3? North Lat. and 22°46? East Long., 180 miles south-east of Barca, 180 west by north of Siwah, the ancient Ammonium, and 426 east by north of Mourzouk. Later authorities, however, place the village of Aujelah in 29°15? North Lat. and 21°55? East Long.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">For an account of the Psylli see B. vii. c. 2. They probably dwelt in the vicinity of the modern Cape Mesurata.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Lake Lynxama, according to Marcus.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Marcus observes that in order properly to understand this passage we must remember that the ancients considered Africa as terminating north of the Equator, and imagined that from the Straits of Hercules the western coast of Africa ran, not towards the south-west, but slanted in a southeasterly direction to the Straits of Babelmandel.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The modern Tripoli.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A flourishing city with a mixed population of Libyans and Sicilians. It was at this place that Apuleius made his eloquent and ingenious defence against the charge of sorcery brought against him by his step-sons. According to some writers the modern Tripoli is built on its site, while other accounts make it to have been situate six leagues from that city.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called the Wady-el-Quaham.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Mannert is of opinion that this was only another name for the city of Leptis Magna or the "Greater Leptis" here mentioned by Pliny. There is little doubt that his supposition is correct.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The more common reading is Taphra or Taphara. D'Anville identifies it with the town of Sfakes.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Scylax identifies it with Neapolis or Leptis, and it is generally looked upon as being the same place as Sabrata or Old Tripoli.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called Lebida. It was the birth-place of the Emperor Septimius Severus. It was almost destroyed by an attack from a Libyan tribe A.D. <date value="366" authname="366">366</date>, and its ruin was completed by the invasion of the Arabs. Its ruins are considerable.</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Men of sea complexion," is the meaning of this Greek name. According to Marcus they dwelt between the Greater Leptis and the Lake Tritonis, at the present day called Schibkah-el-Loudeah.

Sallust (Jugurthine War) is the main authority for the story. It is also related by Pomponius Mela, B. i. c. 7, and Valerius Maximus, B. v. c. 6, but from the Greek name of the brothers, meaning "lovers of praise," it is doubtful whether the story is not of spurious origin.</p><p><span id="note_18"><a href="#ref_18">18. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Lake Tritonis mentioned in note<hi rend="super">11</hi>, p. 393.</p><p><span id="note_19"><a href="#ref_19">19. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called El Hammah, according to Shaw.</p><p><span id="note_20"><a href="#ref_20">20. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">According to some accounts the goddess Pallas or Minerva was born on the banks of Lake Tritonis.</p><p><span id="note_21"><a href="#ref_21">21. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The modern Cape of Tajuni.</p><p><span id="note_22"><a href="#ref_22">22. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called Udina, according to Marcus.</p><p><span id="note_23"><a href="#ref_23">23. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called Tabersole, according to Marcus.</p><p><span id="note_24"><a href="#ref_24">24. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In the north of Byzacium, near the Bagrada and the confines of Numidia.
