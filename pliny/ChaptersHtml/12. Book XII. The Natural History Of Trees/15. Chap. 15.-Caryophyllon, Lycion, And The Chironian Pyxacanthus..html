The same country produces, also, a thorny shrub, with grains which bear a resemblance to pepper, and are of a remarkably bitter taste. Theleaves of this shrub are small, like those of the cyprus;<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> thebranches are three cubits in length, the bark pallid, and theroots wide-spreading and woody, and of a colour resemblingthat of boxwood. By boiling this root with the seed in acopper vessel, the medicament is prepared which is known bythe name of lycion.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> This thorny shrub grows, also, on<pb n="3114" />Mount Pelion;<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> this last kind is much used for the purposeof adulterating the medicament above mentioned. The rootof the asphodel, ox-gall, wormwood, sumach, and the amurcaof olive oil, are also employed for a similar purpose. The bestlycion for medicinal purposes, is that which has a froth on itssurface; the Indians send it to us in leather bottles, made ofthe skin of the camel or the rhinoceros. The shrub itself isknown by some persons in Greece under the name of theChironian pyxacanthus.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It has been suggested that under this name the clove is meant, thoughFŽe and Desfontaines express a contrary opinion. Sprengel thinks that itis the Vitex trifolia of Linn¾us, and Bauhin suggests the cubeb, the Pipercubeba of Linn¾us. FŽe thinks it may have possibly been the Myrtuscaryophyllata of Ceylon, the fruit of which corresponds to the descriptionhere given by Pliny.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See c. 52 of the present Book.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "Lycium." It is impossible to say with exactness what the medicalliquid called "Lycion" was. Catechu, an extract from the tan of theacacia, has been suggested; though the fruit of that tree does not answerthe present description.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">FŽe suggests that this may possibly be the Lycium Europ¾um ofLinn¾us, a shrub not uncommonly found in the south of Europe.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Rhamnus Lycioides of Linn¾us, known to us as buckthorn. Theberries of many varieties of the Rhamnus are violent purgatives.</p></body>
