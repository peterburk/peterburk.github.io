(18.)—REMEDIES FOR HÆMORRHAGE.</head><p>Hæmorrhage is arrested by applying deer's rennet withvinegar, hare's rennet, hare's fur reduced to ashes, or ashes ofburnt asses' dung. The dung, however, of male animals is themost efficacious for this purpose, being mixed with vinegar, andapplied with wool, in all cases of hæmorrhage. In the same way,too, the ashes of a horse's head or thigh, or of burnt calves' dung,are used with vinegar; the ashes also of a goat's horns or dung,<pb n="5359" />with vinegar. But it is the thick blood that issues from theliver of a he-goat when cut asunder, that is looked upon as themost efficacious; or else the ashes of the burnt liver of a goatof either sex, taken in wine or applied to the nostrils withvinegar. The ashes, too, of a leather wine-bottle—but onlywhen made of he-goat skin—are used very efficiently withan equal quantity of resin, for the purpose of stanching blood,and knitting together the lips of the wound. A kid's rennetin vinegar, or the thighs of that animal, reduced to ashes, aresaid to be productive of a similar result.</p></div2></body>
