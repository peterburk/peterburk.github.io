<div2 type="chapter" n="97" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 97. (42.)—VARIOUS KINDS OF CHEESE.</head><p>The kinds of cheese that are most esteemed at Rome, wherethe various good things of all nations are to be judged of bycomparison, are those which come from the provinces of Ne-mausus,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and more especially the villages there of Lesuraand Gabalis;<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> but its excellence is only very short-lived, andit must be eaten while it is fresh. The pastures of the Alpsrecommend themselves by two sorts of cheese; the DalmaticAlps send us the Docleatian<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> cheese, and the Centronian<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>Alps the Vatusican. The kinds produced in the Apennines aremore numerous; from Liguria we have the cheese of Ceba,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>which is mostly made from the milk of sheep; from Umbriawe have that of Æsina, and from the frontiers of Etruria andLiguria those of Luna, remarkable for their vast size, a singlecheese weighing as much as a thousand pounds. Nearer theCity, again, we have the cheese of Vestinum, the best of thiskind being that which comes from the territory of Ceditium.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> Goats also produce a cheese which has been of lateheld in the highest esteem, its flavour being heightened bysmoking it. The cheese of this kind which is made at Romeis considered preferable to any other; for that which is madein Gaul has a strong taste, like that of medicine. Of thecheeses that are made beyond sea, that of Bithynia<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> is usuallyconsidered the first in quality. That salt exists in pasture-lands is pretty evident, from the fact that all cheese as itgrows old contracts a saltish flavour, even where it does notappear to any great extent;<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> while at the same time it isequally well known that cheese soaked in a mixture of thymeand vinegar will regain its original fresh flavour. It is saidthat Zoroaster lived thirty years in the wilderness upon cheese,prepared in such a peculiar manner, that he was insensible tothe advances of old age.<pb n="3086" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Nismes, in France.
