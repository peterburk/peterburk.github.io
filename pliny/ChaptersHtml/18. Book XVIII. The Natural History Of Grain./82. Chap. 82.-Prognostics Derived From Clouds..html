If the clouds are dispersed by a north-east wind, itis a presage of high winds, but if by a wind from the south, ofrain. If at sunset the clouds cover the heavens on either sideof the sun, they are indicative of tempest; if they are blackand lowering in the east, they threaten rain in the night, butif in the west, on the following day. If the clouds spread in<pb n="4122" />large numbers from the east, like fleeces of wool in appearance,they indicate a continuance of rain for the next three days.When the clouds settle on the summits of the mountains,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> therewill be stormy weather; but if the clouds clear away, it willbe fine. When the clouds are white and lowering, a hailstorm,generally known as a "white"<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> tempest, is close athand. An isolated cloud, however small,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> though seen in aclear sky, announces wind and storm.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Theophrastus states to a similar effect, and it is confirmed bythe experience of those who live in mountainous countries.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We still hear of the "white squalls" of the Mediterranean.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"`Behold, there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man'shand.'ÑAnd it came to pass in the meanwhile, that the heaven wasblack with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain."Ñ1 Kings, xviii.44, 45.</p></body>
