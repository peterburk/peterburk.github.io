This is the only metalthat acquires the properties of that stone, retaining them for alength of time, and attracting other iron, so that we may sometimessee a whole chain formed of these rings. The lowerclasses, in their ignorance, call this "live iron," and the woundsthat are made by it are much more severe. This mineral isalso found in Cantabria, not in continuous strata, like thegenuine loadstone, but in scattered fragments, which they call"bullationes."<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> I do not know whether this species of ore isproper also for the fusion of glass,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> as no one has hitherto triedit; but it certainly imparts the same property as the magnetto iron. The architect Timochares<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> began to erect a vaulted roofof loadstone, in the Temple of Arsinoë,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> at Alexandria, in orderthat the iron statue of that princess might have the appearanceof hanging suspended in the air:<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> his death, however,and that of King Ptolemæus, who had ordered this monumentto be erected in honour of his sister, prevented the completionof the project.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">B. xxxvi. c. 25.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Properly "bubbles," or "beads."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxxvi. c. 66.
