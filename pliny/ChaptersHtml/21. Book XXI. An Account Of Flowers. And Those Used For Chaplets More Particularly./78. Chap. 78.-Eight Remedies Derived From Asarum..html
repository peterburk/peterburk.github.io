It purges the bowels likehellebore, and is good for dropsy and affections of the thoracicorgans and uterus, as also for jaundice. When mixed withmust, it makes a wine with strongly diuretic qualities. Itis taken up as soon as it begins to put forth its leaves, and isdried in the shade. It is apt however to turn mouldy veryspeedily.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Asarum Europæum of Linnæus; our foalfoot.
