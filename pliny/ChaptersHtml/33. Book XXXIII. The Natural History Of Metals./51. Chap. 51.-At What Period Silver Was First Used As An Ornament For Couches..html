Carvilius Pollio,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> aRoman of equestrian rank, was the first, it is said, to adornthese last with silver; not, I mean, to plate them all over, noryet to make them after the Delian pattern; the Punic<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> fashionbeing the one he adopted. It was after this last pattern too,that he had them ornamented with gold as well: and it wasnot long after his time that silver couches came into fashion,in imitation of the couches of Delos. All this extravagance,however, was fully expiated by the civil wars of Sulla.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Triclinia."
