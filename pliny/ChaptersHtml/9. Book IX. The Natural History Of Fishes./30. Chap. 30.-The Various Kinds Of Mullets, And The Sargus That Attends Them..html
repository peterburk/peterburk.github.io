<div2 type="chapter" n="30" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 30.—THE VARIOUS KINDS OF MULLETS, AND THE SARGUSTHAT ATTENDS THEM.</head><p>Of the remaining fish that are held in any degree of esteem,the mullet<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> is the most highly valued, as well as the mostabundant of all; it is of only a moderate size, rarely exceedstwo pounds in weight, and will never grow beyond that weightin preserves or fish-ponds. These fish are only to be found inthe Northern Ocean,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> exceeding two pounds in weight, andeven there in none but the more westerly parts. As for theother kinds, the various species are numerous; some<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> liveupon sea-weed, while others feed on the oyster, slime, and theflesh of other fish. The more distinctive mark is a forked<pb n="2402" />beard, that projects beneath the lower lip. The lutarius,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> ormud-mullet, is held in the lowest esteem of all. This last isalways accompanied<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> by another fish, known as the sargus,and where the mullet stirs up the mud, the other finds alimentfor its own sustenance. The mullet that is found on the coastis not<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> highly esteemed, and the most esteemed of all have astrong flavour<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> of shell-fish. Fenestella is of opinion, thatthis fish received its name of mullet [mullus] from its resemblance to the colour of the red or mullet-coloured shoes.<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> Themullet spawns three<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> times a year: at all events, the frymakes its appearance that number of times. The masters ingastronomy inform us, that the mullet, while dying, assumesa variety of colours and a succession of shades, and that thehue of the red scales, growing paler and paler, graduallychanges, more especially if it is looked at enclosed in glass.<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span><pb n="2403" />M. Apicius, a man who displayed a remarkable degree of ingenuity in everything relating to luxury, was of opinion, thatit was a most excellent plan to let the mullet die in the pickleknown as the "garum of the allies"<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>—for we find that eventhis has found a surname—and he proposed a prize for anyone who should invent a new sauce,<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> made from the liver ofthis fish. I find it much easier to relate this fact, than to statewho it was that gained the prize.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier says that this is the <foreign lang="greek">trigla</foreign>of the Greeks, the triglia of modern Italy, the rouget of Provence, and the Mullus barbatus of Linnæus.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The coasts of La Manche, Cuvier says, and the Gulf of Gascony produce a kind of mullet of larger size than usual, varied with stripes of ayellow colour. This, the Mullus surmuletus of Linnæus, is also to be foundin the Mediterranean, but much more rarely than the smaller kind, whichis red all over.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii c. 5; Ælian, Hist. Anim. B. ii. c. 41;and Oppian, Halieut. B. iii. 1. 435.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hardouin says that it is larger than the sea-mullet; and that it dwellsin muddy or slimy spots in the vicinity of the sea-shore.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 5.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably from the fact of its living in the mud. "Doctors differ"on this point. Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 16, says that shore-fishare superior to those caught out at sea; while Seneca, on the other hand,Nat. Quæst. B. iii. c. 18, says that rock-fish and those caught out at seaare the best.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He would almost seem to imply by this that they feed upon shell-fish:but Hardouin has a note to the effect, that Pliny does not mean that theylive on shell-fish, as it would be impossible for them to break the shellto devour the fish within, but only that they have the same flavour as shellfish. But query as to this explanation.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">On the other hand, Isidorus says that the mullet-coloured shoes wereso called from the colour of the fish, which, indeed, is most probable. Theseshoes were made of a kind of red Parthian leather, probably not unlike ourmorocco leather. Festus seems to say that they were worn in general byall the patricians; but the passage of Varro which he quotes, only showsthat they were worn by the curule magistrates, the consul, prætor, and curule ædile.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hence their Greek name,<foreign lang="greek">tri/gla,</foreign> according to Oppian, Halieut. B. i.1. 590.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Seneca has a passage on this subject, Quæst. Nat. B. iii. c. 18, whichstrongly bespeaks the barbarous tastes of the Romans. He says: "A mul-let even, if just caught, is thought little of, unless it is allowed to die inthe hand of your guest. They are carried about enclosed in globes ofglass, and their colour is watched as they die, which is changed by thestruggles of death into various shades and hues." And again: "There isnothing, you say, more beautiful than the colours of the dying mullet; asit struggles and breathes forth its life, it is first purple, and then a palenessgradually comes over it; and then, placed as it is between life and death,an uncertain hue comes over it."</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This anchovy, pickle, or fish-sauce, will be found more fully spokenof in B. xxxi. c. 44.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Alecem. See B. xxxi. c. 44. Seneca speaks of this cruel custom ofpickling fish alive, Quæst. Nat. B. iii. c. 17. "Other fish, again, theykill in sauces, and pickle them alive. There are some persons who lookupon it as quite incredible that a fish should be able to live under-ground.How much more so would it appear to them, if they were to hear of a fishswimming in sauce, and that the chief dish of the banquet was killed at thebanquet, feeding the eye before it does the gullet?"</p></body>
