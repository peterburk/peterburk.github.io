(6.)—THE ORDER DISPLAYED IN THE WORKS OF BEES.</head><p>Bees keep within the hive during the winter—for whenceare they to derive the strength requisite to withstand frostsand snows, and the northern blasts? The same, in fact, isdone by all insects, but not to so late a period; as those<pb n="3006" />which conceal themselves in the walls of our houses, are muchsooner sensible of the returning warmth. With reference tobees, either seasons and climates have considerably changed, orelse former writers have been greatly mistaken. They retirefor the winter at the setting of the Vergiliæ, and remain shutup till after the rising of that constellation, and not till onlythe beginning of spring, as some authors have stated; nor, indeed, does any one in Italy ever think of then opening the hives.They do not come forth to ply their labours until the beanblossoms; and then not a day do they lose in inactivity, whilethe weather is favourable for their pursuits.</p><p>First of all, they set about constructing their combs, andforming the wax, or, in other words, making their dwellingsand cells; after this they produce their young, and then makehoney and wax from flowers, and extract bee-glue<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> from thetears of those trees which distil glutinous substances, thejuices, gums, and resins, namely, of the willow, the elm, andthe reed. With these substances, as well as others of a morebitter nature, they first line the whole inside of the hive, as asort of protection against the greedy propensities of other smallinsects, as they are well aware that they are about to formthat which will prove an object of attraction to them. Havingdone this, they employ similar substances in narrowing theentrance to the hive, if otherwise too wide.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">" Melligo."
