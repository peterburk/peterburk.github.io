Noperson has yet found a vulture's nest: hence it is that thereare some who have thought, though erroneously, that thesebirds come from the opposite hemisphere.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> The fact is, thatthey build their nest upon the very highest rocks; their youngones, indeed, are often to be seen, being generally two in number.Umbricius, the most skilful among the aruspices of our time,says that the vulture lays thirteen eggs,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and that with one of<pb n="2487" />these eggs<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> it purifies the others and its nest, and then throwsit away: he states also that they hover about for three<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> days,over the spot where carcases are about to be found.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The great European vulture.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Their nests are seldom seen, in consequence of being concealed in thecrags of the highest mountains, the Pyrenees, for instance.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Three" seems a better reading.
