<div2 type="chapter" n="30" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 30. (16.)—BRITANNIA.</head><p>Opposite to this coast is the island called Britannia, socelebrated in the records of Greece<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and of our own country.It is situate to the north-west, and, with a large tract ofintervening sea, lies opposite to Germany, Gaul, and Spain,by far the greater part of Europe. Its former name wasAlbion<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>; but at a later period, all the islands, of which weshall just now briefly make mention, were included under thename of "Britanniæ." This island is distant from Gesoriacum,on the coast of the nation of the Morini<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>, at the spot wherethe passage across is the shortest, fifty miles. Pytheas andIsidorus say that its circumference is 4875 miles. It isbarely thirty years since any extensive knowledge of it wasgained by the successes of the Roman arms, and even as yetthey have not penetrated beyond the vicinity of the Caledonian<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> forest. Agrippa believes its length to be 800 miles, and<pb n="1351" />its breadth 300; he also thinks that the breadth of Hiberniais the same, but that its length is less by 200 miles. Thislast island is situate beyond Britannia, the passage acrossbeing the shortest from the territory of the Silures<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>, a distanceof thirty miles. Of the remaining islands none is said tohave a greater circumference than 125 miles. Among thesethere are the Orcades<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>, forty in number, and situate withina short distance of each other, the seven islands calledAcmodæ<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>, the Hæbudes, thirty in number, and, betweenHibernia and Britannia, the islands ofMona<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>, Monapia<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>, Ricina<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>,Vectis<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>, Limnus<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>, and Andros<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>. Below it are the islandscalled Samnis and Axantos<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>, and opposite, scattered in theGerman Sea, are those known as the Glæsariæ<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>, but which<pb n="1352" />the Greeks have more recently called the Electrides, fromthe circumstance of their producing <hi rend="ital">electrum</hi> or amber.The most remote of all that we find mentioned is Thule<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span>, inwhich, as we have previously stated<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span>, there is no night at thesummer solstice, when the sun is passing through the signof Cancer, while on the other hand at the winter solsticethere is no day. Some writers are of opinion that this stateof things lasts for six whole months together. Timæus thehistorian says that an island called Mictis<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> is within six days'sail of Britannia, in which white load<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> is found; and that theBritons sail over to it in boats of osier<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span>, covered with sewedhides. There are writers also who make mention of someother islands, Scandia<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> namely, Dumna, Bergos, and, greater<pb n="1353" />than all, Nerigos, from which persons embark for Thule.At one day's sail from Thule is the frozen ocean, which bysome is called the Cronian Sea.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Britain was spoken of by some of the Greek writers as superior toall other islands in the world. Dionysius, in his Periegesis, says, "thatno other islands whatsoever can claim equality with those of Britain."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Said to have been so called from the whiteness of its cliffs oppositethe coast of Gaul.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Afterwards called Bononia, the modern Boulogne. As D'Anvilleremarks, the distance here given by Pliny is far too great, whether wemeasure to Dover or to Hythe; our author's measurement however isprobably made to Rutupiæ (the modern Richborough), near Sandwich,where the Romans had a fortified post, which was their landing-placewhen crossing over from Gaul. This would make the distance given byPliny nearer the truth, though still too much.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably the Grampian range is here referred to.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The people of South Wales.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Orkney islands were included under this name. PomponiusMela and Ptolemy make them but thirty in number, while Solinus fixestheir number at three only.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Also called Æmodæ or Hæmodæ, most probably the islands nowknown as the Shetlands. Camden however and the older antiquariansrefer the Hæmodæ to the Baltic sea, considering them different from theAcmodæ here mentioned, while Salmasius on the other hand considers theAcmodæ or Hæmodæ and the Hebrides as identical. Parisot remarksthat off the West Cape of the Isle of Skye and the Isle of North Uist,the nearest of the Hebrides to the Shetland islands, there is a vast gulffilled with islands, which still bears the name of Mamaddy or Maddy,from which the Greeks may have easily derived the words <foreign lang="greek">Ai( Maddai\,</foreign>whence the Latin Hæmodæ.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Isle of Anglesea.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Most probably the Isle of Man.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Camden and Gosselin (<hi rend="ital">Rech. sur la Géogr. des Anciens</hi>) considerthat under this name is meant the island of Racklin, situate near thenorth-eastern extremity of Ireland. A Ricina is spoken of by Ptolemy,but that island is one of the Hebrides.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This Vectis is considered by Gosselin to be the same as the smallisland of White-Horn, situate at the entrance of the Bay of Wigtown inScotland. It must not be confounded with the more southern Vectis, orIsle of Wight.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">According to Gosselin this is the island of Dalkey, at the entrance ofDublin Bay.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Camden thinks that this is the same as Bardsey Island, at the southof the island of Anglesea, while Mannert and Gosselin think that it isthe island of Lambay.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">According to Brotier these islands belong to the coast of Britanny,being the modern isles of Sian and Ushant.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">As already mentioned, he probably speaks of the islands of Œlandand Gothland, and Ameland, called Austeravia or Actania, in which<hi rend="ital">glœsum</hi> or amber was found by the Roman soldiers. See p. 344.</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The opinions as to the identity of ancient Thule have been numerousin the extreme. We may here mention six:—1. The common, andapparently the best founded opinion, that Thule is the island ofIceland. 2. That it is either the Ferroe group, or one of thoseislands. 3. Thenotion of Ortelius, Farnaby, and Schœnning, that it is identical withThylemark in Norway. 4. The opinion of Malte Brun, that thecontinental portion of Denmark is meant thereby, a part of which isto thepresent day called Thy or Thyland. 5. The opinion of Rudbeck and ofCalstron, borrowed originally from Procopius, that this is a generalname for the whole of Scandinavia. 6. That of Gosselin, who thinksthat under this name Mainland, the principal of the Shetland Islands, ismeant. It is by no means impossible that under the name of Thuletwo or more of these localities may have been meant, by different authorswriting at distant periods and under different states of geographicalknowledge. It is also pretty generally acknowledged, as Parisot remarks, that the Thule mentioned by Ptolemy is identical with Thylemarkin Norway.</p><p><span id="note_17"><a href="#ref_17">17. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">B. ii. c. 77.</p><p><span id="note_18"><a href="#ref_18">18. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Brotier thinks that under this name a part of Cornwall is meant, andthat it was erroneously supposed to be an island. Parisot is of opinionthat the copyists, or more probably Pliny himself, has made an error intranscribing Mictis for Vectis, the name of the Isle of Wight. It is notimprobable however that the island of Mictis had only an imaginaryexistence.</p><p><span id="note_19"><a href="#ref_19">19. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"White lead": not, however, the metallic substance which weunderstand by that name, but tin.</p><p><span id="note_20"><a href="#ref_20">20. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Commonly known as "coracles," and used by the Welch in moderntimes. See B. vii. c. 57 of this work, and the Note.</p><p><span id="note_21"><a href="#ref_21">21. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Brotier, with many other writers, takes these names to refer tovarious parts of the coast of Norway. Scandia he considers to be thesameas Scania, Bergos the modern Bergen, and Nerigos the northern part ofNorway. On the other hand, Gosselin is of opinion that under the nameof Bergos the Scottish island of Barra is meant, and under that ofNerigos, the island of Lewis, the northern promontory of which is inthe oldmaps designated by the name of Nary or Nery. Ptolemy makes mention ofan island called Doumna in the vicinity of the Orcades.</p></body>
