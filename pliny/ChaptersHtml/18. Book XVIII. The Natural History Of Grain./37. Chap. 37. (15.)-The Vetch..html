It is sown after theground has been but once turned up, and requires neither hoe-ing nor manuring; nothing at all, indeed, except harrowingthere are three periods for sowing it; the first is about thesetting of Arcturus, when it is intended for feeding cattlein the month of December, while in the blade; this crop, too,is the best of all for seed, for, although grazed upon, it willbear just as well. The second crop is sown in the month ofJanuary, and the last in March; this last being the best cropfor fodder. Of all the seeds this is the one that thrives bestin a dry soil; still, however, it manifests no repugnance toa shaded locality. This grain, if gathered when quite ripe,produces a chaff superior to that of any other. If sown nearvines supported by trees, the vetch will draw away the juicesfrom the vines, and make them languid.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Vicia sativa of Linnæus.</p></body>
