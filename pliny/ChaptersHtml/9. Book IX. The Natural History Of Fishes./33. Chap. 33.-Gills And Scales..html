A sign of old age<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> is thehardness of the scales, which are not alike in all. There aretwo lakes<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> of Italy at the foot of the Alps, called Larius andVerbanus, in which there are to be seen every year, at therising of the Vergiliæ,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> fish remarkable for the number of theirscales, and the exceeding sharpness<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> of them, strongly resembling hob-nails<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> in appearance; these fish, however, are onlyto be seen during that month,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> and no longer.<pb n="2406" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He must mean <hi rend="ital">single</hi> ones, on each side of the head. Cuvier remarks,that the present passage is from a longer one in Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B.ii. c. 13, which, however, has come down to us in such a corrupt and fragmentary state, that it is totally unintelligible, or, at all events, does not correspond with modern experience. No fish, he says, is known to us thathas one or two gills only. The Lophii of the system of Linnæus have threegills on each side, and the greater number of fish four, with a half one attached to the opercule. Some cartilaginous fish, again, have five or six,and the lampreys seven.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle, Hist. Anim.

It is most probable that it is to this appearance thatPliny alludes. Rondelet, in his book on Fishes, gives a representation ofit, and calls it "pigus," or "cyprinus clavatus;" but he wrongly, like Pliny,takes it to be a peculiar genus of fish.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Clavorum caligarium"—"nails for the caliga." This was a strong,heavy sandal, worn by the Roman soldiers. It was worn by the centurions,but not by the superior officers; and from the use of it, the common soldiers, including the centurions, were distinguished by the name of "caligati." The Emperor Caligula received that cognomen when a boy, in consequence of wearing the "caliga," and being inured to the life of a commonsoldier. The hob-nails with which the "caliga" was studded are men-tioned again in B. xxii. c. 46, and B. xxxiv. c. 41. Josephus tells us ofthe death of a Roman centurion, which was occasioned by these nails. Aslie was running over the marble pavement of the temple of Jerusalem, hisfoot slipped, and he was unable to rise, upon which he was overpoweredby the Jews, and slain. After the decline of the Roman empire, the caligawas no longer worn by the soldiers, but was assumed by the monks and recluses.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Dalechamps says, that in a similar manner, in the lake known by thename of Paladru, fish of most delicate flavour, called "umblæ," were tobe taken in the month of December, and at no other part of the year; so,too, the alausæ, which are found in the Rhine, near Strasburg, in the monthof May only, and at no other time.</p></body>
