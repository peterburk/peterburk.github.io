THE WONDER-FUL WORKS OF THE SWALLOW. THE BANK-SWALLOW.</head><p>The form of the nest built by the halcyon reminds me alsoof the instinctive cleverness displayed by other birds; and, indeed, in no respect is the ingenuity of birds more deserving ofour admiration. The swallow builds its nest of mud, andstrengthens it with straws. If mud happens to fail, it soaksitself with a quantity of water, which it then shakes from offits feathers into the dust. It lines the inside of the nest with<pb n="2514" />soft feathers and wool, to keep the eggs warm, and in orderthat the nest may not be hard and rough to its young whenhatched. It divides the food among its offspring with themost rigid justice, giving it first to one and then to another.With a remarkable notion of cleanliness, it throws out of thenest the ordure of the young ones, and when they have growna little older, teaches them how to turn round, and let it falloutside of the nest.</p><p>There is another<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> kind of swallow, also, that frequents thefields and the country; its nest is of a different shape, thoughof the same materials, but it rarely builds it against houses.The nest has its mouth turned straight upwards, and the entranceto it is long and narrow, while the body is very capacious. Itis quite wonderful what skill is displayed in the formation ofit, for the purpose of concealing the young ones, and of presenting a soft surface for them to lie upon. At the HeracleoticMouth of the Nile in Egypt, the swallows present an insuperable obstacle to the inroads of that river, in the embankment which is formed by their nests in one continuous line,nearly a stadium in length; a thing that could not possiblyhave been effected by the agency of man. In Egypt, too,near the city of Coptos, there is an island sacred to Isis. Inthe early days of spring, the swallows strengthen the angular corner of this island with chaff and straw, thus fortifying it in order that the river may not sweep it away. Thiswork they persevere in for three days and nights together, withsuch unremitting labour, that it is a well-known fact thatmany of them die with their exertions. This, too, is a toilwhich recurs regularly for them every year.</p><p>There is, again, a third kind<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> of swallow, which makes holesin the banks of rivers, to serve for its nest. The young ofthese birds, reduced to ashes, are a good specific against mortalmaladies of the throat, and tend to cure many other diseases ofthe human body. These birds do not build nests, and they takecare to migrate a good many days before, if it so happens thatthe rise of the river is about to reach their holes.<pb n="2515" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The first is the common chimney swallow.
