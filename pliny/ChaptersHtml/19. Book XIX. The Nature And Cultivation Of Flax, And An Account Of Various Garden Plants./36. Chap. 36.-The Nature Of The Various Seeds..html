<div2 type="chapter" n="36" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 36.—THE NATURE OF THE VARIOUS SEEDS.</head><p>In most plants the seed is round, in some oblong; it is broadand foliaceous in some, orage for instance, while in others it isnarrow and grooved, as in cummin. There are differences,also, in the colour of seeds, which is either black or white;while some seeds are woody and hard, in radishes, mustard,and rape, the seeds are enclosed in pods. In parsley, coriander, anise, fennel, and cummin, the seed has no covering at all,while in blite, beet, orage, and ocimum, it has an outer coat,and in the lettuce it is covered with a fine down. There is noseed more prolific than that of ocimum<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>; it is generally recommended<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> to sow it with the utterance of curses and imprecations, the result being that it grows all the better for it;the earth, too, is rammed down when it is sown, and prayersoffered that the seed may never come up. The seeds which areenveloped in an outer coat, are dried with considerable difficulty, that of ocimum more particularly; hence it is that allthese seeds are dried artificially, their fruitfulness being greatlypromoted thereby.</p><p>Plants in general come up better when the seed is sown inheaps than when it is scattered broad-cast: leeks, in fact, andparsley are generally grown by sowing the seed in little bags<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>:in the case of parsley, too, a hole is made with the dibble, and alayer of manure inserted.</p><p>All garden plants grow either from seed or from slips, andsome from both seed and suckers, such as rue, wild marjoram,and ocimum<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, for example—this last being usually cut whenit is a palm in height. Some kinds, again, are reproducedfrom both seed and root, as in the case of onions, garlic, andbulbs, and those other plants of which, though annuals themselves, the roots retain their vitality. In those plants whichgrow from the root, it lives for a considerable time, and throwsout offsets, as in bulbs, scallions, and squills for example.—<pb n="4179" />Others, again, throw out offsets, though not from a bulbousroot, such as parsley and beet, for instance. When the stalkis cut, with the exception<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> of those which have not a roughstem, nearly all these plants put forth fresh shoots, a thing thatmay be seen in ocimum<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>, the radish<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>, and the lettuce<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>, whichare in daily use among us; indeed, it is generally thought thatthe lettuce which is grown from a fresh sprouting, is thesweetest. The radish, too, is more pleasant eating when theleaves have been removed before it has begun to run to stalk.The same is the case, too, with rape; for when the leaves aretaken off, and the roots well covered up with earth, it growsall the larger for it, and keeps in good preservation till the en-suing summer.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Fée says that basil, the Ocimum basilicum of Linnæus, is not meanthere, nor yet the leguminous plant that was known to the Romans by thatname.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A singular superstition truly!
