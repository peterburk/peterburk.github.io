A camel's taildried, it is said, is productive of diarrhœa, and ashes of burntcamel's dung, mixed with oil, make the hair curl. Theseashes, applied topically, are very useful for dysentery, as alsotaken in drink, the proper dose being a pinch in three fingersat a time; they are curative also of epilepsy. Camel's urineit is said, is very useful to fullers, and is good for the cure ofrunning sores. Barbarous nations, we are told, are in the habitof keeping it till it is five years old, and then taking it as apurgative, in doses of one semisextarius. The hairs of thetail, it is said, plaited and attached to the left arm, are a curefor quartan fevers.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny has omitted the milk of the camel, which, according to Tavernier, is an excellent cure for dropsy.</p></body>
