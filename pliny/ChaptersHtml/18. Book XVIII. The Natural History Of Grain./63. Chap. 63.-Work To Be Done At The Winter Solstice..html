About this period, also, the cherry-tree, hesays, should be planted. Acorns, too, should now be put insoak for the oxen, a modius for each pair. If given in largerquantities, this food will prove injurious to their health; andwhenever it is given, if they are fed with it for less than thirtydays in succession, an attack of scab in the spring, it is said,will be sure to make you repent.</p><p>This, too, is the period that we have already assigned<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> forcutting timber—other kinds of work, again, may be found forthe hours of the night, which are then so greatly prolonged.There are baskets, hurdles, and panniers to be woven, and wood<pb n="4083" />to be cut for torches: squared stays<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> for the vine may be prepared,too, thirty in the day time, and if rounded,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> as many assixty. In the long hours of the evening, too, some five squaredstays, or ten rounded ones may be got ready, and the samenumber while the day is breaking.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. xvi. c. 74.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Ridicas."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Palos."</p></body>
