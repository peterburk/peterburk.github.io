<div2 type="chapter" n="77" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 77. (75.)ÑWHERE THE DAYS ARE THE LONGEST ANDWHERE THE SHORTEST.</head><p>Hence it follows, that in consequence of the daylightincreasing in various degrees, in Mero‘ the longest day<pb n="1109" />consists of twelve ¾quinoctial hours and eight parts of anhour<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>, at Alexandria of fourteen hours, in Italy of fifteen, inBritain of seventeen; where the degree of light, which existsin the night, very clearly proves, what the reason of the thingalso obliges us to believe, that, during the solstitial period,as the sun approaches to the pole of the world, and his orbitis contracted, the parts of the earth that lie below him havea day of six months long, and a night of equal length whenhe is removed to the south pole. Pytheas, of Marseilles<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>,informs us, that this is the case in the island of Thule<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>, whichis six days' sail from the north of Britain. Some personsalso affirm that this is the case in Mona, which is about 200miles from Camelodunum<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, a town of Britain.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Hora duodecim in partes, ut as in totidem uncias dividebatur.Octonas igitur partes hor¾ antiqu¾, sive bessem, ut Martianus vocat,nobis probe repr¾sentant horarum nostratium 40 sexagesim¾, quasmiuntas vocamus." Alexandre in Lemaire, i. 396.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">For a notice of Pytheas see Lemaire, i. 210. He was a geographerand historian who lived in the time of Ptolemy Philadelphus; but hisveracity does not appear to have been highly estimated by hiscontemporaries.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Thule of Pliny has been generally supposed to be the ShetlandIsles. What is here asserted respecting the length of the day, as well asits distance from Britain, would indeed apply much more correctly toIceland than to Shetland; but we have no evidence that Iceland wasknown to the ancients. Our author refers to the length of the day inThule in two subsequent parts of his work, iv. 30 and vi. 36.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Supposed to be Colchester in Essex; while the Mona of Pliny appearsto have been Anglesea. It is not easy to conceive why the authormeasured the distance of Mona from Camelodunum.</p></body>
