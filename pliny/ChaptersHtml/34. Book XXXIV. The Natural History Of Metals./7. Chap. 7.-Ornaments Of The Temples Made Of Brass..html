I find it stated, also,that Cneius Octavius, who obtained a naval triumph over KingPerseus,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> erected the double portico to the Flaminian Circus,which was called the "Corinthian" from the brazen capitals ofthe pillars.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> It is stated also, that an ordinance was made thatthe Temple of Vesta<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> should be covered with a coating ofSyracusan metal. The capitals, too, of the pillars, which wereplaced by M. Agrippa in the Pantheon, are made of similarmetal. Even the opulence, too, of private individuals hasbeen wrested to similar purposes. Spurius Carvilius, thequæstor, among the other charges which he brought againstCamillus,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> accused him of having brazen doors in his house.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A.
