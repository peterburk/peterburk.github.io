Still, however, it cannot be properly termedwax, but rather the foundation of the honey-combs; by meansof it all inlets are stopped up, which might, otherwise, servefor the admission of cold or other injurious influences; it hasalso a strong odour, so much so, indeed, that many people useit instead of galbanum.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "conusis," "gummy matter."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pitch-wax.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A kind of bee-glue; the origin of the name does not seem to beknown.
