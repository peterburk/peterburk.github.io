<div2 type="chapter" n="74" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 74. (50.)—THE GENERATION OF FISHES.</head><p>The curiosity and wonder which have been excited in mankind by this subject, will not allow me any longer to defergiving an account of the generation of these animals. Fishescouple by rubbing their bellies<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> against one another; an operation, however, that is performed with such extraordinarycelerity as to escape the sight. Dolphins<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> also, and otheranimals of the cetaceous kind, couple in a similar manner,though the time occupied in so doing is somewhat longer. Thefemale fish, at the season for coupling, follows the male, andstrikes against its belly with its muzzle; while the male in itsturn, when the female is about to spawn, follows it and devours<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>the eggs. But with them, the simple act of coupling is notsufficient<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> for the purposes of reproduction; it is necessaryfor the male to pass among the eggs which the female has produced, in order to sprinkle them with its vitalizing fluid. Thisdoes not, however, reach all the eggs out of so vast a multitude; indeed, if it did, the seas and lakes would soon be filled,seeing that each female produces these eggs in quantities innumerable.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span><pb n="2462" /></p><p>(51.) The eggs<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> of fishes grow in the sea; some of themwith the greatest rapidity, those of the muræna, for instance;others, again, somewhat more slowly. Those among the flatfishes,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> whose tails or stings are not in the way, as well asthose of the turtle kind, couple the one upon the other:the polypus by attaching one of its feelers to the nostrils<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>of the female, the sæpia and loligo, by means of the tongue;uniting the arms, they then swim contrary ways; these last alsobring forth at the mouth. The polypi,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> however, couplewith the head downwards towards the ground, while the restof the soft<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> fish couple backwards in the same manner as thedog; cray-fish and shrimps do the same, and crabs employ themouth.</p><p>Frogs leap the one upon the other, the male with its forefeet clasping the armpits of the female, and with its hinderones the haunches. The female produces tiny pieces of blackflesh, which are known by the name of gyrini,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> and are only<pb n="2463" />to be distinguished by the eyes and tail; very soon, however, the feet are developed, and the tail, becoming bifurcate,forms the hind legs. It is a most singular thing, but, after alife of six months' duration, frogs melt away<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> into slime,though no one ever sees how it is done; after which they cometo life again in the water during the spring, just as they were<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>before. This is effected by some occult operation of Nature,and happens regularly every year.</p><p>Mussels, also, and scallops are produced in the sand by thespontaneous<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> operations of nature. Those which have a hardershell, such as the murex and the purple, are formed from aviscous fluid like saliva, just as gnats are produced from liquidsturned sour,<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> and the fish called the apua,<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> "from the foam ofthe sea when warm, after the fall of a shower.</p><p>Those fish, again, which are covered with a stony coat, suchas the oyster, are produced from mud in a putrid state, or elsefrom the foam that has collected around ships which have beenlying for a long time in the same position, about posts driveninto the earth, and more especially around logs of wood.<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> Ithas been discovered, of late years, in the oyster—Beds,<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> that<pb n="2464" />the animal discharges an impregnating liquid,<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> which has theappearance of milk. Eels, again, rub themselves against rocks,upon which, the particles<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> which they thus scrape from off theirbodies come to life, such being their only means of reproduction.The various kinds of fishes do not couple out of their own kind,with the exception of the squatina and the ray.<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> The fishthat is produced from the union of these two, resembles a rayin the fore part, and bears a name among the Greeks compounded of the two.<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span></p><p>Certain animals are produced only at certain seasons of theyear, both in water and on the land, such, for instance, as scallops, snails, and leeches, in the spring, which also disappear atstated periods. Among fishes, the wolf-fish<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span> and the trichias<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span>bring forth twice in the year, as also do all kinds of rock-fish;the mullet and the chalcis<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span> thrice in the year, the cyprinus<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span>six times, the scorpæna<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span> twice, and the sargus in spring andautumn. Among the flat-fish, the squatina brings forth twice<pb n="2465" />a year, being the only<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span> one that does so at the setting of the<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span>Vergiliæ in autumn. Most fish spawn in the three months ofApril, May, and June. The salpa brings forth in the autumn,the sargus, the torpedo, and the squalus<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span> about the time of theautumnal equinox. The soft fishes<span id="ref_31"><a href="#note_31">[31]</a></span> bring forth in spring, thesæpia every month in the year; its eggs adhere together witha kind of black glutinous substance, in appearance like a bunchof grapes, and the male is very careful to go among them andbreathe<span id="ref_32"><a href="#note_32">[32]</a></span> upon them, as otherwise they would be barren. Thepolypi couple in winter, and produce eggs in the spring twistedin spiral clusters, in a similar manner to the tendrils of thevine; and so remarkably prolific are they, that when the animal is killed in a state of pregnancy, the cavities of the headare quite unable to contain the multitude<span id="ref_33"><a href="#note_33">[33]</a></span> of eggs enclosedtherein. They bring forth these eggs at the fiftieth day, but inconsequence of the vast number of them, great multitudesperish. Cray-fish, and other sea-animals with a thinner crust,lay their eggs one upon the other, and then sit upon them.The female polypus sometimes sits upon its eggs, and at othertimes closes the entrance of its retreat by spreading out itsfeelers, interlaced like a net. The sæpia brings forth on dryland, among reeds or such sea-weed as it may find growingthere, and hatches its eggs on the fifteenth day. Theloligo produces its eggs out at sea, clustered together likethose of the sæpia. The purple,<span id="ref_34"><a href="#note_34">[34]</a></span> the murex, and other fishesof the same kind, bring forth in the spring. Sea-urchins havetheir eggs at full moon during the winter; sea-snails<span id="ref_35"><a href="#note_35">[35]</a></span> also areproduced during the winter season.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier says, that this is not the case in general; but that some,more especially those which are viviparous, actually do couple; while, onthe other hand, in most, the male does nothing else but besprinkle with themilt the eggs which the female has deposited, as is stated by Pliny a littlefurther on.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">These belong to the cetacea; which, as Cuvier says, are now universally placed among the mammifera, and not among the fishes. Theycouple, he says, in the same manner as quadrupeds do in general.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">As Aristotle says, "from those that are left the fishes are produced."</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. vi. c. 12.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It has been calculated, Cuvier says, that a female cod, or sturgeon,produces in a year more than one hundred thousand eggs.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier says, that the eggs of the common fishes, of toads, frogs, &amp;,have no shells, but only a membranous tunic; and when they have beenonce fecundated, they imbibe the surrounding moisture, and increase tillthey produce the animal.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is probable, Cuvier thinks, that this passage relates more especiallyto the ray genus, but that there is no very positive knowledge as to themode in which they do couple. It is probable, he suggests, that they maydo it in the manner above mentioned, by the attrition of the belly. As tothe turtle genus, he says, it is certain that the male mounts the back of thefemale; and in some species the sternum of the male is concave, the betterto adapt itself to the convex callipash of the female.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">More properly, the physeter, passage, or orifice.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier remarks, that this account of the coupling of the cephalopodesis taken from Aristotle. He says, that he is not aware whether modernobservation has confirmed these statements, and almost doubts whether,considering the organization of these animals, it is not almost more probable that they do not couple at all, and that the male, as in the case ofmost other fishes, only fecundates the eggs after they have been depositedby the female.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier says, that whatever may be the sense in which the word"mollia" is here taken, the assertion is not correct. The gasteropodmolluscs, he says, whether hermaphroditical, or whether of separate sexes,couple side to side. The acephalous molluscs do not couple at all, andeach individual fecundates its own eggs. The crustacea couple by attritionof the belly.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Tadpoles." There is both truth and falsehood, Cuvier says, in thestatements here made relative to the tadpole. Frogs, he says, produceeggs, from which the tadpole developes itself, with a tail like that of a fish.The feet, however, are not produced by any bifurcation of the tail, butshoot out at the base of the tail, and in the same proportion that they grow,the tail decreases, till at last it entirely disappears.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Frogs, Cuvier says, conceal themselves in mud and slime during thewinter, but, of course, are not changed into it.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Quæ fuere." Just in the same state, he probably means to say, inwhich they were when they were melted into slime, and not as they werewhen in the tadpole state.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">All that is asserted here, Cuvier says, about the spontaneous operations of nature is totally false. Everything connected with the eggs andthe generation of the mussel, the murex, and the scallop is now clearlyascertained.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Acescente humore." Hardouin has suggested that the properreading may be "arescente humore"—" from moisture dried up;" for, heremarks, Aristotle, in his Hist. Anim. B. v. c. 18, states, that the"empides," gnats formed from the ascarides in the slime of wells, aremore frequently produced in the autumn season.</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The apuæ, or aphyæ, Cuvier says, are nothing else but the fry of fishof a large kind.</p><p><span id="note_17"><a href="#ref_17">17. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier says, that some of the shell-fish deposit their eggs upon stakesand piles, which are driven down into the water among sea-weed, and thebottoms of old ships: but that many of them perish from the solutionsformed by those bodies in a state of rottenness, or, at all events, are notproduced from their decomposition.</p><p><span id="note_18"><a href="#ref_18">18. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Ostreariis." This was unknown to Aristotle, who, in his work DeGener. Anim. B. iii. c. 11, expressly denies that the oyster secretes anygenerative or fecundating liquid.</p><p><span id="note_19"><a href="#ref_19">19. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier says, that at the time of the oyster spawning, its body appearsswollen in some parts with a milky fluid, which is not improbably the fecundating fluid. During this season the oyster is generally looked upon asunfit for food; among us, from the beginning of May to the end of July.</p><p><span id="note_20"><a href="#ref_20">20. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This, Cuvier remarks, is a mere vague hypothesis, as to the reproduction of the eel, without the slightest foundation. Pliny borrows itfrom Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. vi. c. 9.</p><p><span id="note_21"><a href="#ref_21">21. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The squatina and the ray do not interbreed, Cuvier observes, anymore than other fish; and the Squatina raia, or rhinobatis, (which wassaid to be their joint production), is a particular species, more flat in formthan the squalus, and longer than the ray.</p><p><span id="note_22"><a href="#ref_22">22. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot"><foreign lang="greek">Rino/batos,</foreign> the squatinoraia."</p><p><span id="note_23"><a href="#ref_23">23. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Lupus."

The moderns, he says,have pretty generally agreed to give it to the carp, but without any goodand sufficient foundation. It was a lake or river fish, which, as Aristotlesays, Hist. Anim. B. vi. c. 14, deposited its eggs five or six times in theyear, and which had a palate so fleshy, that it might almost be mistakenfor a tongue, B. iv. c. 8, characteristics that appear well suited to the carp.But then, on the other hand, Oppian mentions it, Halieut. B. i., as a shorefish, implying apparently that it belonged to the sea; and Pliny himself,in c. 25 of the present Book, does the same, by his words, "hoc et in mariaccidere cyprino." The words "in mari," however, he has added, of hisown accord, to the account which he has derived from Aristotle.</p><p><span id="note_27"><a href="#ref_27">27. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The fish called the sea-scorpion.
