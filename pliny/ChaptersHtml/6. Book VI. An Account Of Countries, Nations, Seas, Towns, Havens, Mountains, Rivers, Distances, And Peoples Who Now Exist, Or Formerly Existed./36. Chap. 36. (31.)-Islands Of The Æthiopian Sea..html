<div2 type="chapter" n="36" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 36. (31.)—ISLANDS OF THE ÆTHIOPIAN SEA.</head><p>We learn from Ephorus, as well as Eudoxus and Timosthenes, that there are great numbers of islands scattered allover this sea; Clitarchus says that king Alexander was informed of an island so rich that the inhabitants gave a talentof gold for a horse, and of another<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> upon which there wasfound a sacred mountain, shaded with a grove, the trees ofwhich emitted odours of wondrous sweetness; this last wassituate over against the Persian Gulf. Cerne<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> is the nameof an island situate opposite to Æthiopia, the size of whichhas not been ascertained, nor yet its distance from the mainland: it is said that its inhabitants are exclusively Æthiopians. Ephorus states that those who sail from the RedSea into the Æthiopian Ocean cannot get beyond the Columnæ<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> there, some little islands so called. Polybius says<pb n="2106" />that Cerne is situate at the extremity of Mauritania, overagainst Mount Atlas, and at a distance of eight stadia fromthe land; while Cornelius Nepos states that it lies verynearly in the same meridian as Carthage, at a distance from themainland of ten miles, and that it is not more than two milesin circumference. It is said also that there is another islandsituate over against Mount Atlas, being itself known by thename of Atlantis.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> Five days' sail beyond it there are deserts,as far as the Æthiopian Hesperiæ and the promontory, whichwe have mentioned as being called Hesperu Ceras, a point atwhich the face of the land first takes a turn towards the westand the Atlantic Sea. Facing this promontory are also saidto be the islands called the Gorgades,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> the former abodes ofthe Gorgons, two days' sail from the mainland, according toXenophon of Lampsacus. Hanno, a general of the Carthaginians, penetrated as far as these regions, and brought backan account that the bodies of the women were covered withhair, but that the men, through their swiftness of foot, madetheir escape; in proof of which singularity in their skin,and as evidence of a fact so miraculous, he placed the skins<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>of two of these females in the temple of Juno, which wereto be seen there until the capture of Carthage. Beyond theseeven, are said to be the two islands of the Hesperides; butso uncertain are all the accounts relative to this subject, thatStatius Sebosus says that it is forty days' sail, past the coastof the Atlas range, from the islands of the Gorgons to thoseof the Hesperides, and one day's sail from these to theHesperu Ceras. Nor have we any more certain informationrelative to the islands of Mauritania. We only know, as afact well-ascertained, that some few were discovered by Jubaover against the country of the Autololes, upon which he established a manufactory of Gætulian purple.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span><pb n="2107" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Marcus says that these islands are those called the "Two Sisters,"situate to the west of the Isle of Socotra, on the coast of Africa. Theyare called by Ptolemy, Cocionati.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The position of this island has been much discussed by geographers,as being intimately connected with the subject of Hanno's voyage to thesouth of Africa. Gosselin, who carries that voyage no further south thanCape Non, in about 28° north lat., identifies Cerne with Fedallah, on thecoast of Fez, which, however, is probably much too far to the north. MajorRennell places it as far south as Arguin, a little to the south of the southernCape Blanco, in about 20° 5? North latitude. Heeren, Mannert, and others,adopt the intermediate portion of Agadir, or Souta Cruz, on the coast ofMorocco, just below Cape Ghir, the termination of the main chain of theAtlas. If we are to trust to Pliny's statement, it is pretty clear that nothingcertain was known about it in his day.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The "Pillars." Marcus thinks that these were some small islandsnear the Isle of Socotra.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hardouin says that this is not the Atlantis rendered so famous byPlato, whose story is distantly referred to in B. ii. c. 92 of this work.
