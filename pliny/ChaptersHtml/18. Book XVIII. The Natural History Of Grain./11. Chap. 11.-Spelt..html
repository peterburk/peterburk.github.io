Spelt is much heavier than barley, and wheatheavier than spelt. In Egypt they make a meal<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> of olyra,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>a third variety of corn that grows there. The Gauls havealso a kind of spelt peculiar to that country: they give it thename of "brace,"<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> while to us it is known as "sanldala:" ithas a grain of remarkable whiteness. Another difference,again, is the fact that it yields nearly four pounds more ofbread to the modius than any other kind of spelt. Verriusstates that for three hundred years the Romans made use of noother meal than that of corn.<pb n="4025" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Oats and rye excepted.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Here the word "far" means "a meal," or "flour," a substitute forthat of "far," or "spelt."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Triticum monococcum, according to some.
