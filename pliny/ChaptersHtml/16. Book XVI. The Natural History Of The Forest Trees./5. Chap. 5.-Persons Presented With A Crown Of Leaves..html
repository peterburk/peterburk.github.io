This Hostus was thegrandfather of King Tullus Hostilius. P. Decius the elder,the military tribune, was presented with a crown of leaves bythe army which had been saved by his valour, under the command of Cornelius Cossus,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> the consul, in the war with theSamnites. This crown was made at first of the leaves of theholm oak, but afterwards those of the æsculus<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> were preferred, as being a tree sacred to Jupiter: this, however, wassoon employed indifferently with the quercus, according as<pb n="3344" />each might happen to present itself, the honourable distinctiongiven to the acorn being the only thing observed. Rigorouslaws were, however, enacted, to maintain the lofty glories ofthis wreath, by which it was placed upon an equality evenwith the supreme honours of the wreath that is given byGreece in presence of Jove<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> himself, and to receive which theexulting city of the victor is wont to break<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> a passage throughits very walls. These laws are to the effect that the life of afellow-citizen must be preserved, and an enemy slain; thatthe spot where this takes place must have been held by theenemy that same day; that the person saved shall admit thefact, other witnesses being of no use at all; and that the personsaved shall have been a Roman citizen.</p><p>To preserve an ally merely, even though it should be thelife of a king that is so saved, confers no right to this high reward, nor is the honour at all increased, even if it is theRoman general that has been thus preserved, it being the intention of the framers of the law that it should be the statusof the citizen that is everything. When a man has receivedthis wreath, it is his privilege to wear it for the rest of hislife. When he makes his appearance at the celebration of thegames,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> it is customary for the Senate even to rise from theirseats, and he has the right of taking his seat next to the senators.Exemption, too, from all civic duties is conferred upon him aswell as his father and his father's father. Siccius Dentatus, as wehave already mentioned<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> on an appropriate occasion, receivedfourteen civic crowns, and Manlius Capitolinus<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> six,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> one,among the rest, for having saved the life of his general, Servilius. Scipio Africanus declined to accept the civic crownfor having saved the life of his father at the battle of Trebia.Times these, right worthy of our everlasting admiration,which accorded honour alone as the reward of exploits somighty, and which, while other crowns were recommended bybeing made of gold, disdained to set a price upon the safety ofa citizen, and loudly proclaimed thereby that it is unrighteousto save the life of a man for motives of lucre.<pb n="3345" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He is called Tullus Hostilius by Dionysius of Halicarnassus, the sameas his grandson.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A.U.C. 411.
