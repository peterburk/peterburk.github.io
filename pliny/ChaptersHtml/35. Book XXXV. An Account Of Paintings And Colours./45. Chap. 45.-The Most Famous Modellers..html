<div2 type="chapter" n="45" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 45.—THE MOST FAMOUS MODELLERS.</head><p>The most celebrated modellers were Damophilus and Gorgasus,who were painters as well. These artists adorned withtheir works, in both kinds, the Temple of Ceres,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> in the CircusMaximus at Rome; with an inscription in Greek, whichstated that the decorations on the right-hand were the workmanshipof Damophilus, and those on the left, of Gorgasus.Varro says that, before the construction of this temple, everythingwas Tuscan<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> in the temples; and that, when the templewas afterwards repaired, the painted coatings of the walls were<pb n="6285" />cut away in tablets and enclosed in frames, but that the figureson the pediments were dispersed. Chalcosthenes,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> too,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> executedat Athens some works in unbaked earth, on the spotwhich, from his manufactory, has since obtained the name of"Ceramicus."<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span></p><p>M. Varro states that he knew an artist at Rome, Possis byname, who executed fruit, grapes, and fish, with such exactness,that it was quite impossible, by only looking at them, todistinguish them from the reality. He speaks very highlyalso of Arcesilaüs,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> who was on terms of intimacy withLucius Lucullus,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> and whose models in plaster used to sell ata higher rate, among artists themselves, than the works ofothers. He informs us, also, that it was by this modeller thatthe Venus Genetrix in the Forum of Cæsar was executed, ithaving been erected before completion, in the great haste thatthere was to consecrate it; that the same artist had made anagreement with Lucullus to execute a figure of Felicity, at theprice of sixty thousand sesterces, the completion of which wasprevented by their death; and that Octavius, a Roman ofequestrian rank, being desirous of a model for a mixing-bowl,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>Arcesilaüs made him one in plaster, at the price of one talent.</p><p>Varro praises Pasiteles<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> also, who used to say, that theplastic art was the mother of chasing, statuary, and sculpture,and who, excellent as he was in each of these branches, neverexecuted any work without first modelling it. In addition tothese particulars, he states that the art of modelling wasanciently cultivated in Italy, Etruria in particular; and thatVolcanius was summoned from Veii, and entrusted by TarquiniusPriscus with making the figure of Jupiter, which heintended to consecrate in the Capitol; that this Jupiter wasmade of clay, and that hence arose the custom of painting itwith minium;<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> and that the four-horse chariot, so often<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span><pb n="6286" />mentioned, upon the pediment of the temple, was made of clayas well. We learn also from him, that it was by the sameartist that the Hercules was executed, which, even to this day,is named<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> at Rome from the material of which it is composed.Such, in those times, were the most esteemed statues of thegods; and small reason have we to complain of our forefathersfor worshipping such divinities as these; for in their day therewas no working of gold and silver—no, not even in theservice of the gods.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In the Eleventh Region of the City.
