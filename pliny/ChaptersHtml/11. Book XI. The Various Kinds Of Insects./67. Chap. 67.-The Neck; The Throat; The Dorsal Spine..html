All the others which have thegullet only, have nothing but a gorge or throat. In thosewhich have a neck, it is formed of several rounded vertebr¾,and is flexible, and joined together by distinct articulations, toallow of the animal turning round the head to look. Thelion, the wolf, and the hy¾na are the only animals in whichit is formed of a single<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> rigid bone. The neck is annexed tothe spine, and the spine to the loins. The vertebral columnis of a bony substance, but rounded, and pierced within,to afford a passage for the marrow to descend from the brain.It is generally concluded that the marrow is of the same natureas the brain, from the fact that if the membrane of exceedingthinness which covers it is pierced, death immediately ensues.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>Those animals which have long legs have a long throat as well,<pb n="3064" />which is the case also with aquatic birds, although they haveshort legs, as well as with those which have hooked talons.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">All these animals, on the contrary, have seven vertebr¾.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is not the fact.
