FOUR KINDS OF CYDONIA, ANDFOUR VARIETIES OF THE STRUTHEA.</head><p>Next in size after these are the fruit called by us "cotonea,"<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> by the Greeks "Cydonia,"<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and first introduced<pb n="3293" />from the island of Crete. These fruit bend the branches withtheir weight, and so tend to impede the growth of the parenttree. The varieties are numerous. The chrysomelum<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> ismarked with indentations down it, and has a colour incliningto gold; the one that is known as the "Italian" quince, is of apaler complexion, and has a most exquisite smell: the quincesof Neapolis, too, are held in high esteem. The smaller varieties of the quince which are known as the "struthea,"<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> havea more pungent smell, but ripen later than the others; thatcalled the "musteum,"<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> ripens the soonest of all. The cotoneum engrafted<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> on the strutheum, has produced a peculiarvariety, known as the "Mulvianum," the only one of themall that is eaten raw.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> At the present day all these varietiesare kept shut up in the antechambers of great men,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> where theyreceive the visits of their courtiers; they are hung, too, uponthe statues<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> that pass the night with us in our chambers.</p><p>There is a small wild<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> quince also, the smell of which, nextto that of the strutheum, is the most powerful; it grows inthe hedges.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The quince, the Pirus Cydonia of Linn¾us.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From Cydonia, a city of Crete.
