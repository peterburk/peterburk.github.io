The trees in theseregions are of a marvellous nature; for, corroded by the actionof the salt, and bearing a considerable resemblance to vegetable substances that have been thrown up and abandoned bythe tide, they are seen to embrace the arid sands of the seashore with their naked roots, just like so many polypi. Whenthe tide rises, buffeted by the waves, there they stand, fixedand immoveable; nay, more, at high water they are completelycovered; a fact which proves to conviction, that they derivetheir nutriment from the salt contained in the water. Thesize of these trees is quite marvellous; in appearance theystrongly resemble the arbute; the fruit, which on the outsideis very similar to the almond, has a spiral kernel within.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">B. vi. c. 28.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is supposed that the Rhizophora Mangle of Linn¾us is the treethat is here described. It grows on all the coasts of India, from Siam tothe entrance of the Persian Gulf. It takes root on spots which have beeninundated by the sea, and its boughs bend downwards, and taking root inthe earth, advance gradually towards the sea. The leaf and fruit have thecharacteristics of those of the arbute and almond as here mentioned.</p></body>
