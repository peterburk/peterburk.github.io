(43.)ÑWOODS UNITED WITH GLUE.</head><p>Glue, too, plays one of the principal parts in all veneeringand works of marqueterie. For this purpose, the workmenusually employ wood with a threaded vein, to which they givethe name of "ferulea," from its resemblance to the grain ofthe giant fennel,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> this part of the wood being preferred fromits being dotted and wavy. In every variety there are somewoods to be found that will not take the glue, and which refuse to unite either with wood of the same kind or of anyother; the wood of the robur for example. Indeed, it ismostly the case that substances will not unite unless they areof a similar nature; a stone, for instance, cannot be made toadhere to wood. The wood of the service-tree, the yoke-elm,the box, and, in a less degree, the lime, have a particularaversion to uniting with the cornel. All the yielding woodswhich we have already spoken<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> of as flexible readily adaptthemselves to every kind of work; and in addition to them,the mulberry and the wild fig. Those which are moderatelymoist are easily sawn and cut, but dry woods are apt to giveway beyond the part that is touched by the saw; while, onthe other hand, the green woods, with the exception of therobur and the box, offer a more obstinate resistance, filling theintervals between the teeth of the saw with sawdust, andrendering its edge uniform and inert; it is for this reasonthat the teeth are often made to project right and left in turns,<pb n="3428" />a method by which the saw-dust is discharged. The ash isfound the most pliable wood of all for working; and, indeed,for making<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> spears it is better even than the hazel, beinglighter than the cornel, and more pliable than the wood ofthe service-tree. The Gallic variety is so supple, that it isemployed in the construction of vehicles even. The elmwould rival the trunk of the vine<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> for some purposes, wereit not that its weight is so much against it.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ferula.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In c. 77.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See c. 24.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">FŽe thinks, from the context, that the meaning is, that the vine wasemployed in the construction of chariots; it depends entirely on the punctuation adopted.</p></body>
