<div2 type="chapter" n="29" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 29.—FIFTEEN REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE CHAMÆLEON.</head><p>To these animals we shall annex some others that are equallyforeign, and very similar in their properties. To begin thenwith the chameleon, which Democritus has considered worthyto be made the subject of an especial work, and each part ofwhich has been consecrated to some particular purpose—Thisbook, in fact, has afforded me no small amusement, revealing<pb n="5316" />as it does, and exposing the lies and frivolities of the Greeks.—In size, the chameleon resembles the crocodile last mentioned,and only differs from it in having the back-bone arched at amore acute angle, and a larger tail. There is no animal, it isthought, more<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> timid than this, a fact to which it owes itsrepeated changes of colour.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> It has a peculiar ascendancy overthe hawk tribe; for, according to report, it has the power ofattracting those birds, when flying above it, and then leavingthem a voluntary prey for other animals. Democritus<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> assertsthat if the head and neck of a chamæleon are burnt in afire made with logs of oak, it will be productive of a stormattended with rain and thunder; a result equally produced byburning the liver upon the tiles of a house. As to the rest ofthe magical virtues which he ascribes to this animal, we shallforbear to mention them, although we look upon them as unfounded;<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> except, indeed, in some few instances where theirvery ridiculousness sufficiently refutes his assertions.</p><p>The right eye, he says, taken from the living animal andapplied with goats' milk, removes diseases of the crystallinehumours of the eyes; and the tongue, attached to the body asan amulet, is an effectual preservative against the perils ofchild-birth. He asserts also that the animal itself will facilitateparturition, if in the house at the moment; but if, on theother hand, it is brought from elsewhere, the consequences, hesays, will be most dangerous. The tongue, he tells us, if takenfrom the animal alive, will ensure a favourable result to suitsat law; and the heart, attached to the body with black woolof the first shearing, is a good preservative against the attacksof quartan fever.</p><p>He states also that the right fore-paw, attached to the leftarm in the skin of the hyena, is a most effectual preservative against robberies and alarms at night; that the pap onthe right side is a preventive of fright and panics; that theleft foot is sometimes burnt in a furnace with the plant whichalso has the name of "chamæleon,"<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> and is then made up, withsome unguent, into lozenges; and that these lozenges, kept in<pb n="5317" />a wooden vessel, have the effect, if we choose to believe him,of making their owner invisible to others; that the possession,also, of the right shoulder of this animal will ensure victory overall adversaries or enemies, provided always the party throwsthe sinews of the shoulder upon the ground and treads themunder foot. As to the left shoulder of the chamæleon, I shouldbe quite ashamed to say to what monstrous purposes Democritus devotes it; how that dreams may be produced by theagency thereof, and transferred to any person we may thinkproper; how that these dreams may be dispelled by the employment of the right foot; and how that lethargy, which hasbeen produced by the right foot of this animal, may be removedby the agency of the left side.</p><p>So, too, head-ache, he tells us, may be cured by sprinklingwine upon the head, in which either flank of a chameleon hasbeen macerated. If the feet are rubbed with the ashes of theleft thigh or foot, mixed with sow's milk, gout, he says, willbe the result. It is pretty generally believed, however, thatcataract and diseases of the crystalline humours of the eyesmay be cured by anointing those organs with the gall for threeconsecutive days; that serpents may be put to flight by dropping some of it into the fire; that weasels may be attracted bywater into which it has been thrown; and that, applied to thebody, it acts as a depilatory. The liver, they say, applied withthe lungs of a bramble-frog, is productive of a similar effect:in addition to which, we are told that the liver counteracts theeffects of philtres; that persons are cured of melancholy bydrinking from the warm skin of a chamæleon the juice ofthe plant known by that name; and that if the intestines ofthe animal and their contents—we should bear in mind thatin reality the animal lives without food<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>—are mixed withapes' urine, and the doors of an enemy are besmeared with themixture, he will, through its agency, become the object ofuniversal hatred.</p><p>We are told, too, that by the agency of the tail, thecourse of rivers and torrents may be stopped, and serpentsstruck with torpor; that the tail, prepared with cedar andmyrrh, and tied to a double branch of the date-palm, willdivide waters that are smitten therewith, and so disclose every-<pb n="5318" />thing that lies at the bottom—and I only wish<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> that Democri-tus himself had been touched up with this branch of palm,seeing that, as he tells us, it has the property of putting anend to immoderate garrulity. It is quite evident that thisphilosopher, a man who has shown himself so sagacious inother respects, and so useful to his fellow-men, has been ledaway, in this instance, by too earnest a desire to promote thewelfare of mankind.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is a timid animal, but Pliny's authorities have exaggerated itstimidity.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This change of colour is in reality owing to change of locality.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A.
