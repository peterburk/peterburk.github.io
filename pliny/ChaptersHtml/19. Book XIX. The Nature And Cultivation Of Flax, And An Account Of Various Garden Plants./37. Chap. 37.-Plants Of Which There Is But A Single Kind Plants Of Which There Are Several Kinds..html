<div2 type="chapter" n="37" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 37.ÑPLANTS OF WHICH THERE IS BUT A SINGLE KINDPLANTS OF WHICH THERE ARE SEVERAL KINDS.</head><p>Of ocimum, lapathum, blite, cresses, rocket, orage, coriander,and anise respectively, there is but a single kind, these plantsbeing the same everywhere, and no better in one place thanin another. It is the general belief that stolen<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> rue growsthe best, while, on the other hand, bees<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> that have been stolenwill never thrive. Wild mint, cat-mint, endive, and pennyroyal, will grow even without any cultivation. With reference to the plants of which we have already spoken, or shallhave occasion to speak, there are numerous varieties of manyof them, parsley more particularly.</p><p>(8.) As to the kind of parsley<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> which grows spontaneouslyin moist localities, it is known by the name of "helioselinum;"<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>it has a single leaf<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> only, and is not rough at the edges. In<pb n="4180" />dry places, we find growing the kind known as "hipposelinum,"<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> consisting of numerous leaves, similar to helioselinum.A third variety is the oreoselinum<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>, with leaves like those ofhemlock, and a thin, fine, root, the seed being similar to thatof anise, only somewhat smaller.</p><p>The differences, again, that are found to exist in cultivatedparsley<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>, consist in the comparative density of the leaves, thecrispness or smoothness of their edges, and the thinness orthickness of the stem, as the case may be: in some kinds, again,the stem is white, in others purple, and in others mottled.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This puerility, FŽe observes, runs counter to the more moral adage,that "stolen goods never prosper."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xi. c. 15.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This variety, FŽe says, is the Apium graveolens of Linn¾us.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or marsh-parsley.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny has mistranslated, or rather misread, the passage of Theo-phrastus, who says, B. vii. c. 6, that this kind of parsley is <foreign lang="greek">mano/fullon,</foreign>"thinly covered with leaves," and not <foreign lang="greek">mono/fullon,</foreign> "having a singleleaf." Palladius (<hi rend="ital">In Aprili.</hi>) translates it, "molli folio," "with a softleaf;" but, though FŽe commends this version, it is not correct.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "horse-parsley." Hardouin takes this to be Macedonian parsley,the Bubon Macedonicum of Linn¾us. FŽe, following C. Bauhin andSprengel, is inclined to identify it with Macerona, the Smyrnium olusatrum of Linn¾us.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "mountain-parsley." Probably the Athamanta oreoselinum ofLinn¾us. Some commentators, however, take it to be the Laserpitiumformosum of Wilidenow. Sprengel identifies it with the Selinum oreoselinum of Linn¾us.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Apium petroselinum, probably, of Linn¾us.</p></body>
