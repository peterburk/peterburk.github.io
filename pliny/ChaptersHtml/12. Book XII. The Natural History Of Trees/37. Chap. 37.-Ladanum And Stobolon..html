Hence it is that as the animal crops the sproutingshoots of the branches which are swollen with a liquid juiceof remarkable sweetness, these juices drop and become mingled together, and are then wiped up by the shaggy hairs ofits unlucky beard. Being there mingled with the dust, thesejuices form knots and tufts, and are then dried by the sun;and hence the circumstance is accounted for that in the ladanum which is imported by us we find goats' hairs. This,however, we are told, occurs nowhere but among the Nabat¾i,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> a people of Arabia, who border upon Syria. The morerecent writers call this substance by the name of stobolon, andstate that in the forests of Arabia the trees are broken by thegoats while browzing, and that the juices in consequence adhere to their shaggy hair; but the genuine ladanum, theyassure us, comes from the island of Cyprus. I make mention ofthis in order that every kind of odoriferous plant may be takensome notice of, even though incidentally and not in the orderof their respetive localities. They say also that this Cyprianladanum is collected in the same manner as the other, andthat it forms a kind of greasy substance or Ïsypum,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> whichadheres to the beards and shaggy legs of the goats; but thatit is produced from the flowers of the ground-ivy, which theyhave nibbled when in quest of their morning food, a time atwhich the whole island is covered with dew. After this, theysay, when the fogs are dispersed by the sun, the dust adheresto their wet coats, and the ladanum is formed, which is afterwards taken off of them with a comb.</p><p>There are some authors who give to the plant of Cyprus,from which it is made, the name of leda; and hence it is that<pb n="3134" />we find it also called ledanum. They say, also, that a viscoussubstance settles upon this plant, and, that, by the aid ofstrings wound around it, its leaves are rolled into balls, fromwhich a kind of cake is made. Hence it is, that in Cyprus, aswell as in Arabia, there are two kinds of ladanum; the onenatural, and mingled with earth, and the other artificial: theformer is friable, while the latter is of a viscous nature.</p><p>It is stated, also, that this substance is the produce of ashrub originally found in Carmania, and propagated by plants,by order of the Ptolemies, in the parts beyond Egypt; whileother authorities are found, which say that it grows on theincense tree, and is gathered like gum, from incisions made inthe bark, after which it is collected in bags of goat-skin. Thatof the most approved quality, sells at the rate of forty assesper pound. Ladanum is adulterated with myrtle berries, andfilth taken from the fleeces of other animals besides the goat.If genuine, it ought to have a wild and acrid smell, in somemeasure redolent of the desert places where it is produced: itis dry and parched in appearance, but becomes soft the momentit is touched. When ignited, it gives a brilliant flame, andemits a powerful but pleasant odour; if mixed with myrtleberries, its spurious quality is immediately discovered by theircrackling in the fire. In addition to this, the genuine ladanum has more grits, or stony particles, adhering to it, thandust.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This substance is still gathered from the Cistus creticus of Linn¾us,which is supposed to be the same as the plant leda, mentioned by Pliny.It is also most probably the same as the Cisthon, mentioned by Pliny inB. xxiv. c. 48. It is very commonly found in Spain. The substance isgathered from off the leaves, not by the aid of goats, but with whips furnished with several thongs, with which the shrubs are beaten. There aretwo sorts of ladanum known in commerce; the one friable, and mixed withearthy substances, and known as "ladanum in tortis;" the other black, andsoft to the fingers, the only adventitious substances in which are a littlesand and a few hairs.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. vi. c. 32.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">For some further account of this substance, see B. xxix. c. 10. Filthyas it was, the Ïsypum, or sweat and grease of sheep, was used by theRoman ladies as one of their most choice cosmetics. Ovid, in his "Art ofLove," more than once inveighs against the use of it.</p></body>
