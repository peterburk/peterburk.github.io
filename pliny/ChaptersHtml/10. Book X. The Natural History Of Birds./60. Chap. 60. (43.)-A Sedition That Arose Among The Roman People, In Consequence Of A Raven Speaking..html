(43.)ÑA SEDITION THAT AROSE AMONG THE ROMANPEOPLE, IN CONSEQUENCE OF A RAVEN SPEAKING.</head><p>Let us do justice, also, to the raven, whose merits have beenattested not only by the sentiments of the Roman people, butby the strong expression, also, of their indignation. In thereign of Tiberius, one of a brood of ravens that had bred onthe top of the temple of Castor,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> happened to fly into a shoemaker's shop that stood opposite: upon which, from a feelingof religious veneration, it was looked upon as doubly recommended by the owner of the place. The bird, having beentaught to speak at an early age, used every morning to fly tothe Rostra, which look towards the Forum; here, addressingeach by his name, it would salute Tiberius, and then theC¾sars<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> Germanicus and Drusus, after which it would proceed to greet the Roman populace as they passed, and then return to the shop: for several years it was remarkable for theconstancy of its attendance. The owner of another shoemaker'sshop in the neighbourhood, in a sudden fit of anger killed thebird, enraged, as he would have had it appear, because with itsordure it had soiled some shoes of his. Upon this, there wassuch rage manifested by the multitude, that he was at oncedriven from that part of the city, and soon after put to death.The funeral, too, of the bird was celebrated with almost endless obsequies; the body was placed upon a litter carried uponthe shoulders of two ®thiopians, preceded by a piper, andborne to the pile with garlands of every size and description.The pile was erected on the right-hand side of the AppianWay, at the second milestone from the City, in the field gene-<pb n="2525" />rally known as the "field of Rediculus."<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> Thus did the raretalent of a bird appear a sufficient ground to the Roman peoplefor honouring it with funeral obsequies, as well as for inflictingpunishment on a Roman citizen; and that, too, in a city inwhich no such crowds had ever escorted the funeral of any oneout of the whole number of its distinguished men, and whereno one had been found to avenge the death of Scipio ®milianus,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> the man who had destroyed Carthage and Numantia.This event happened in the consulship of M. Servilius andCaius Cestius, on the fifth day<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> before the calends of April.</p><p>At the present day also, the moment that I am writing this,there is in the city of Rome a crow which belongs to a Romanof equestrian rank, and was brought from B¾tica. In the firstplace, it is remarkable<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> for its colour, which is of the deepestblack, and at the same time it is able to pronounce severalconnected words, while it is repeatedly learning fresh ones.Recently, too, there has been a story told about Craterus, surnamed Monoceros,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> in Erizena,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> a country of Asia, who wasin the habit of hunting with the assistance of ravens, and usedto carry them into the woods, perched on the tuft of his helmet and on his shoulders. The birds used to keep on the watchfor game, and raise it; and by training he had brought this artto such a pitch of perfection, that even the wild ravens wouldattend him in a similar manner when he went out. Someauthors have thought the following circumstance deserving ofremembrance:ÑA crow that was thirsty was seen heapingstones into the urn on a monument, in which there was somerain-water which it could not reach: and so, being afraid togo down to the water, by thus accumulating the stones, it<pb n="2526" />caused as much water to come within its reach as was necessaryto satisfy its thirst.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In the eighth region of the city.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The nephew and son of Tiberius.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Festus says that the "fane of Rediculus was without the Porta Capena; it was so called because Hannibal, when on the march from Capua,turned back (redierit) at that spot, being alarmed at certain portentousvisions."</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">P.
