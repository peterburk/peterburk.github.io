THE PYRAMIDS.</head><p>We must make some mention, too, however cursorily, of thePyramids of Egypt, so many idle<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and frivolous pieces ofostentation of their resources, on the part of the monarchs ofthat country. Indeed, it is asserted by most persons, that theonly motive for constructing them, was either a determinationnot to leave their treasures to their successors or to rivals that<pb n="6336" />might be plotting to supplant them, or to prevent the lowerclasses from remaining unoccupied. There was great vanitydisplayed by these men in constructions of this description,and there are still the remains of many of them in an unfinishedstate. There is one to be seen in the Nome of Arsino•tes;<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>two in that of Memphites, not far from the Labyrinth,of which we shall shortly have to speak;<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and two in the placewhere Lake MÏris<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> was excavated, an immense artificialpiece of water, cited by the Egyptians among their wondrousand memorable works: the summits of the pyramids, it is said,are to be seen above the water.</p><p>The other three pyramids, the renown of which has filledthe whole earth, and which are conspicuous from every quarterto persons navigating the river, are situate on the African<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>side of it, upon a rocky sterile elevation. They lie betweenthe city of Memphis and what we have mentioned<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> as theDelta, within four miles of the river, and seven miles anda-half from Memphis, near a village known as Busiris, thepeople of which are in the habit of ascending them.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ajasson thinks that they were intended as places of sepulture for thekings, but for the concealment, also, of their treasures.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. v. c. 9.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In Chapter 19 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. v. c. 9.
