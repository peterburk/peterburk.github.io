The nations of Sarmatia<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> live principally on thisporridge, and even the raw meal, with the sole addition ofmares' milk, or else blood<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> extracted from the thigh of thehorse. The Æthiopians know of no other grain but millet andbarley.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Tartars still employ millet as one of their principal articles offood. They also extract a kind of wine from it.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Virgil alludes to this, georg. iii. 463.</p></body>
