<div2 type="chapter" n="49" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 49.—WALLS OF BRICK. THE METHOD OF MAKING BRICKS.</head><p>Earth for making bricks should never be extracted from asandy or gravelly soil, and still less from one that is stony;but from a stratum that is white and cretaceous, or else impregnatedwith red earth.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> If a sandy soil must be employedfor the purpose, it should at least be male<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> sand, and no other.The spring is the best season for making bricks, as at midsummerthey are very apt to crack. For building, bricks twoyears old are the only ones that are approved of; and thewrought material of them should be well macerated beforethey are made.</p><p>There are three different kinds of bricks; the Lydian, whichis in use with us, a foot-and-a-half in length by a foot inbreadth; the tetradoron; and the pentadoron; the word "doron"being used by the ancient Greeks to signify the palm<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>—hence,too, their word "doron" meaning a gift, because it is thehand that gives.—These last two kinds, therefore, are namedrespectively from their being four and five palms in length,the breadth being the same. The smaller kind is used inGreece for private buildings, the larger for the construction ofpublic edifices. At Pitane,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> in Asia, and in the cities of Maxiluaand Calentum in Farther Spain, there are bricks<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> made,which float in water, when dry; the material being a sort of<pb n="6291" />pumice-earth, extremely good for the purpose when it can bemade to unite. The Greeks have always preferred walls ofbrick, except in those cases where they could find siliciousstone for the purposes of building: for walls of this naturewill last for ever, if they are only built on the perpendicular.Hence it is, that the Greeks have built their public edifices andthe palaces of their kings of brick; the wall at Athens, forexample, which faces Mount Hymettus; the Temples ofJupiter and Hercules at Patræ,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> although the columns andarchitraves in the interior are of stone; the palace of KingAttalus at Tralles; the palace of Crœsus at Sardes, now convertedinto an asylum<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> for aged persons; and that of KingMausolus at Halicarnassus; edifices, all of them, still in existence.</p><p>Muræna and Varro, in their ædileship, had a fine fresco painting,on the plaster of a wall at Lacedæmon, cut away fromthe bricks, and transported in wooden frames to Rome, for thepurpose of adorning the Comitium. Admirable as the workwas of itself, it was still more admired after being thus transferred.In Italy also there are walls of brick, at Arretiumand Mevania.<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> At Rome, there are no buildings of this description,because a wall only a foot-and-a-half in thicknesswould not support more than a single story; and by publicordinance it has been enacted that no partition should exceedthat thickness; nor, indeed, does the peculiar construction ofour party-walls admit of it.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Rubrica."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxxi. c. 28.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Which was, as a measure, nearly three inches in breadth.
