(15.)—TEN VARIETIES OF THE MAPLE.</head><p>The maple, which is pretty nearly of the same<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> size as thelime, is inferior to the citrus<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> only for the beauty of its woodwhen employed for cabinet work, and the exquisite finish itadmits of. There are numerous varieties<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> of this tree; thelight maple, remarkable for the extreme whiteness of its wood,is known as the "Gallic"<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> maple in Italy beyond the Padus,being a native of the countries beyond the Alps. Anotherkind is covered with wavy spots running in all directions.In consequence of its superior beauty it has received its name,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>from its strong resemblance to the marks which are seen inthe tail of the peacock; the finest kinds are those which growin Istria and Rhætia. An inferior sort of maple is known as"crassivenium."<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span></p><p>The Greeks distinguish the varieties according to their respective localities. The maple of the plains,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> they say, iswhite, and not wavy; they give it the name of "glinon."On the other hand, the mountain maple,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> they say, is of amore variegated appearance, and harder, the wood of the maletree being more particularly so, and the best adapted for spe-<pb n="3368" />cimens of elegant workmanship. A third kind, again, according to the Greeks, is the zygia,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> with a red wood, which iseasily split, and a pale, rough bark. Other authors, however,prefer to make of this last a peculiar species, and give it inLatin the name of "carpinus."</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The maple is much less in size than what the lime or linden really is.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xiii. c. 29.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Fée says there are but five varieties of the maple known in France.He doubts whether the common maple, the Acer campestre of Linnæus,was known to the ancients.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Fée identifies it with the Acer pseudo-platanus of Linnæus, the Acermontanum candidum of C.
