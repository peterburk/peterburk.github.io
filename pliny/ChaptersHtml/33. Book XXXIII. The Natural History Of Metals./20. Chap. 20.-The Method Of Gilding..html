To effect thismode of gilding, the copper is first well hammered, after whichit is subjected to the action of fire, and then cooled with amixture of salt, vinegar, and alum.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> It is then cleansed of allextraneous substances, it being known by its brightness whenit has been sufficiently purified. This done, it is againheated by fire, in order to enable it, when thus prepared, withthe aid of an amalgam of pumice, alum, and quicksilver, toreceive the gold leaf when applied. Alum has the same propertyof purifying copper, that we have already<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> mentionedas belonging to lead with reference to gold.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Without entering into any research respecting the minerals employed for this cement, called 'leucophoron,' one may readily conceivethat it must have been a ferruginous ochre, or kind of bole, which is stillused as a ground.
