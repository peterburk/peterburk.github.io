INDICA.ION.</head><p>The stones called Id¾i dactyli,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and found in Crete, are ofan iron colour, and resemble the human thumb in shape. Thecolour of icterias<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> resembles that of livid skin, and hence itis that it has been thought so excellent a remedy for jaundice.There is also another stone of this name, of a still more lividcolour; while a third has all the appearance of a leaf. Thislast is broader than the others, almost imponderous, and streakedwith livid veins. A fourth kind again is of the same colour,but blacker, and marked all over with livid veins. Jovisgemma<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> is a white stone, very light, and soft: another namegiven to it is "drosolithos."<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> Indica<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> retains the name ofthe country that produces it: it is a stone of a reddish colour,and yields a purple liquid<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> when rubbed. There is anotherstone also of this name, white, and of a dusty appearance.Ion<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> is an Indian stone, of a violet tint: it is but rarely,however, that it is found of a deep, full, colour.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Id¾an fingers." These were probably Belemnites, so called fromtheir long, tapering shape, and being first observed, perhaps, on MountIda in Crete.
