<div2 type="chapter" n="34" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 34.—THE VARIOUS NATURES OF FRUIT.</head><p>Thus much, then, for the various classes and kinds of fruit:it will be as well now to classify their various natures withina more limited scope. Some fruits grow in a pod which issweet itself, and contains a bitter seed: whereas in most kindsof fruit the seed is agreeable to the palate, those which growin a pod are condemned. Other fruits are berries, with thestone within and the flesh without, as in the olive and thecherry: others, again, have the berry within and the stonewithout, the case, as we have already stated, with the berriesthat grow in Egypt.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span></p><p>Those fruits, known as "pomes," have the same characteristics as the berry fruits; in some of them we find the body ofthe fruit within and the shell without, as in the nut, for example; others, again, have the meat of the fruit without andthe shell within, the peach and the plum, for instance: therefuse part being thus surrounded with the flesh, while inother fruits the flesh is surrounded by the refuse part.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>nuts are enclosed in a shell, chesnuts in a skin; in chesnutsthe skin is taken off, but in medlars it is eaten with the rest.Acorns are covered with a crust, grapes with a husk, andpomegranates with a skin and an inner membrane. The mulberry is composed of flesh and juice, while the cherry consistsof juice and skin. In some fruits the flesh separates easilyfrom the woody part, the walnut and the date, for instance;in others it adheres, as in the case of the olive and the laurelberry: some kinds, again, partake of both natures, the peach,for example; for in the duracinus<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> kind the flesh adheres tothe stone, and cannot be torn away from it, while in the other<pb n="3327" />sorts they are easily separated. In some fruits there is nostone or shell<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> either within or without, one variety of thedate,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> for instance. In some kinds, again, the shell is eaten,just the same as the fruit; this we have already mentioned asbeing the case with a variety of the almond found in Egypt.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>Some fruits have on the outside a twofold refuse covering, thechesnut, the almond, and the walnut, for example. Some,again, are composed of three separate parts—the body of thefruit, then a woody shell, and inside of that a kernel, as in thepeach.</p><p>Some fruits grow closely packed together, such as grapesand sorbs: these last, just like so many grapes in a cluster,cling round the branch and bend it downwards with theirweight. On the other hand, some fruits grow separately, at adistance from one another; this is the case with the peach.Some fruits are enclosed in a sort of matrix, as with the grainsof the pomegranate: some hang down from a stalk, such asthe pear, for instance: others hang in clusters, grapes anddates, for example. Others, again, grow upon stalks andbunches united: this we find the case with the berries of theivy and the elder. Some adhere close to the branches, likethe laurel berry, while other varieties lie close to the branchor hang from it, as the case may be: thus we find in the olivesome fruit with short stalks, and others with long. Some fruitsgrow with a little calyx at the top, the pomegranate, for example, the medlar, and the lotus<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> of Egypt and the Euphrates.</p><p>Then, too, as to the various parts of fruit, they are held indifferent degrees of esteem according to their respective recommendations. In the date it is the flesh that is usuallyliked, in those of Thebais it is the crust;<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> the grape and thecaryota date are esteemed for their juice, the pear and theapple for their firmness, the melimelum<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> for its soft meat,<pb n="3328" />the mulberry for its cartilaginous consistency, and nuts fortheir kernels. Some fruits in Egypt are esteemed for theirskin; the carica,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> for instance. This skin, which in thegreen fig is thrown away as so much refuse peeling, when thefig is dried is very highly esteemed. In the papyrus,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>the ferula,<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> and the white thorn<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> the stalk itself constitutesthe fruit, and the shoots of the fig-tree<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> are similarlyemployed.</p><p>Among the shrubs, the fruit of the caper<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> is eaten alongwith the stalk; and in the carob,<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> what is the part that iseaten but so much wood? Nor ought we to omit one peculiarity that exists in the seed of this fruit—it can be calledneither flesh, wood, nor cartilage, and yet no other name hasbeen found for it.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The fruit of the ben, or myrobalanus, the Balanites Ægyptiaca.
