Juice of peucedanum<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> is good for flatulency, actingpowerfully as a carminative: the same is the case, also, withroot of acoron<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and with daucus,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> eaten like lettuce as a salad.Ladanum<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> of Cyprus, taken in drink, is curative of intestinalaffections; and a similar effect is produced by powdered gentian,taken in warm water, in quantities about as large as a bean.For the same purpose, plantago<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> is taken in the morning, indoses of two spoonfuls, with one spoonful of poppy in fourcyathi of wine, due care being taken that it is not old wine. Itis given, too, at the last moment before going to sleep, and withthe addition of nitre or polenta,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> if a considerable time haselapsed since the last meal.
