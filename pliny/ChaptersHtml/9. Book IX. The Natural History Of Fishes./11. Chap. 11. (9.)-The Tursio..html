(9.)ÑTHE TURSIO.</head><p>There is a fish called the tursio,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> which bears a strong resemblance to the dolphin; it differs from it, however, in acertain air of sadness, and is wanting in its peculiar vivacity.This animal most resembles the dog-fish,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> however, in theshape and dangerous powers of the muzzle.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier remarks, that there is some confusion here between an animalof the dolphin kind, and another of the genus Squalus. He suggests thatthe Delphinus tursio of Linn¾us (our porpoise) is meant; but then therewould be no ground for comparing its teeth with those of the dog-fish orshark. He remarks also, that Athen¾us, B. vii. p. 310, speaks of pieces ofsalted flesh from the dog-fish, as being called by the name of tursio.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Under this name he probably means the shark as well as the dog-fish.This passage is curiously rendered by Holland. "But especially they aresnouted like dogges, when they snarle, grin, and are readie to do a shrewdturne."</p></body>
