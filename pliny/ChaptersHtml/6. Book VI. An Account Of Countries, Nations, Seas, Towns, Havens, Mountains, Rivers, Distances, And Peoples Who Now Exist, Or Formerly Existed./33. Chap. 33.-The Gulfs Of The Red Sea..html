<div2 type="chapter" n="33" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 33.ÑTHE GULFS OF THE RED SEA.</head><p>We will now trace the rest of the coast that lies oppositeto that of Arabia. Timosthenes has estimated the length ofthe whole gulf at four days' sail, and the breadth at two,making the Straits<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> to be seven miles and a half in width.Eratosthenes says that the length of the shore from the mouthof the gulf is thirteen hundred miles on each side, while Artemidorus states that the length on the Arabian side is seventeen hundred and fifty miles, (29.) and that along the Troglodytic coast, to Ptolemais, the distance is eleven hundredand thirty-seven and a half. Agrippa, however, maintainsthat there is no difference whatever in the length of the twosides, and makes it seventeen hundred and twenty-two miles.Most writers mention the length as being four hundred andseventy-five miles, and make the Straits to face the southeast,being twelve miles wide according to some, fifteen according toothers.</p><p>The localities of this region are as follow: On passing the®lanitic Gulf there is another gulf, by the Arabians called<pb n="2092" />SÏa, upon which is situate the city of Herošn.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> The townof Cambysu<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> also stood here formerly, between the Neli andthe Marchades, Cambyses having established there the invalids of his army. We then come to the nation of the Tyri,and the port of the Danei, from which place an attempt hasbeen made to form a navigable canal to the river Nile, at thespot where it enters the Delta previously mentioned,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> thedistance between the river and the Red Sea being sixty-twomiles. This was contemplated first of all by Sesostris,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> kingof Egypt, afterwards by Darius, king of the Persians, andstill later by Ptolemy II.,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> who also made a canal, one hundredfeet in width and forty deep, extending a distance of thirty-seven miles and a half, as far as the Bitter Springs.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> He wasdeterred from proceeding any further with this work by apprehensions of an inundation, upon finding that the Red Seawas three cubits higher than the land in the interior of Egypt.Some writers, however, do not allege this as the cause, butsay that his reason was, a fear lest, in consequence of introducing the sea, the water of the Nile might be spoilt, that beingthe only source from which the Egyptians obtain water fordrinking. Be this as it may, the whole of the journey fromthe Egyptian Sea is usually performed by land one of thethree following ways:ÑEither from Pelusium across the sands,in doing which the only method of finding the way is by meansof reeds fixed in the earth, the wind immediately effacing all<pb n="2093" />traces of footsteps: by the route which begins two miles beyond Mount Casius, and at a distance of sixty miles enters theroad from Pelusium, adjoining to which road the Arabiantribe of the Autei dwell; or else by a third route, whichleads from Gerrum, and which they call Adipsos,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> passingthrough the same Arabians, and shorter by nearly sixty miles,but running over rugged mountains and through a districtdestitute of water. All these roads lead to Arsino‘,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> a cityfounded in honour of his sister's name, upon the Gulf of Carandra, by Ptolemy Philadelphus, who was the first to exploreTroglodytice, and called the river which flows before Arsino‘by the name of Ptolem¾us. After this comes the little townof Enum, by some writers mentioned as Philotera; next towhich are the Abas¾i, a nation sprung from intermarriageswith the Troglodyt¾, then some wild Arabian tribes, the islandsof Sapirine and Scytala, and after these, deserts as far asMyoshormon, where we find the fountain of Tatnos, Mount®as, the island of Iambe, and numerous harbours. Berenicealso, is here situate, so called after the name of the mother ofPhiladelphus, and to which there is a road from Coptos, as wehave previously stated;<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> then the Arabian Autei, and the Zebadei.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or Herošpolis, a city east of the Delta, in Egypt, and situate nearthe mouth of the royal canal which connected the Nile with the Red Sea.It was of considerable consequence as a trading station upon the arm of theRed Sea, which runs up as far as Arsino‘, the modern Suez, and wascalled the "Gulf" or "Bay of the Heroes."
