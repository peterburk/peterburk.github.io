<div2 type="chapter" n="10" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 10. (5.)—THE DIFFERENT KINDS AND FORMS OF STATUES.STATUES AT ROME WITH CUIRASSES.</head><p>In former times the statues that were thus dedicated wereclad in the toga.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> Naked statues also, brandishing a spear,after the manner of the youths at their gymnastic exercises,were much admired; these were called "Achillean." TheGreek practice is, not to cover any part of the body; while,on the contrary, the Roman and the military statues have theaddition of a cuirass. Cæsar, the Dictator, permitted a statuewith a cuirass to be erected in honour of him in his Forum.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> Asto the statues which are made in the garb of the Luperci,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>they are of no older date than those which have been latelyerected, covered with a cloak.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> Mancinus gave directions,that he should be represented in the dress which he wore whenhe was surrendered to the enemy.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> It has been remarked by<pb n="6156" />some authors, that L. Attius,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> the poet, had a statue of himselferected in the Temple of the Muses,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> which was extremelylarge, although he himself was very short.</p><p>Equestrian statues are also held in esteem in Rome; butthey are of Greek origin, no doubt. Among the Greeks, thosepersons only were honoured with equestrian statues who werevictors on horseback<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> in the sacred games; though afterwardsthe same distinction was bestowed on those who were successfulin the races with chariots with two or four horses: hencethe use of chariots with us in the statues of those who havetriumphed. But this did not take place until a late period;and it was not until the time of the late Emperor Augustus,that we had chariots represented with six horses,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> as also withelephants.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. vii. cc. 31, 34: B. viii. c. 74: and B. ix. c. 63.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Near the Temple of Janus, in the Eighth Region of the City.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Luperci were the priests of Pan, who, at the celebration of theirgames, called Lupercalia, were in the habit of running about the streets ofRome, with no other covering than a goat's skin tied about the loins.—B.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Pænula."

B. iii. c. 30, and by Valerius Maximus, B. ii. c. 7, that Marcinus made a treaty with the Numantines,which the senate refused to ratify, and that he was, in consequence, surrenderedto the enemy. We may suppose that he regarded the transaction as redounding more to the discredit of the senate than of himself.—B.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See end of B. xviii.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In the First Region of the City, near the Capenian Gate.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Celetes;" this appellation is derived from the Greek word <foreign lang="greek">ke/lhs</foreign>,"swift," and was applied to those who rode on horseback, in opposition tothe charioteers.—B.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Poinsinet remarks that Pliny has forgotten the gilded chariot, withsix horses, which Cneius Cornelius dedicated in the Capitol, two hundredyears before Augustus; he also refers to an ancient inscription in Gruter,which mentions chariots of this description.—B.</p></body>
