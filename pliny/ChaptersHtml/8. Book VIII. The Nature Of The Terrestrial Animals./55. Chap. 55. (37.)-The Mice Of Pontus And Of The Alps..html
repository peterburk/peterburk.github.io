(37.)—THE MICE OF PONTUS AND OF THE ALPS.</head><p>The mice of Pontus also conceal themselves during thewinter; but only the white ones.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> I wonder how thoseauthors, who have asserted that the sense of taste in theseanimals is very acute, found out that such is the fact. TheAlpine mice, which are the same size as badgers, also concealthemselves;<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> but they first carry a store of provisions intotheir retreat. Some writers, indeed, say that the male andfemale, lying on their backs alternately, hold in their paws abundle of gnawed herbs, and, the tail of each in its turn beingseized by the teeth of the other, in this way, they aredragged into their hole; hence it is, that at this seasontheir hair is found to be rubbed off their backs. There is asimilar animal also in Egypt,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> which sits, in the same way,upon its haunches, and walks on two feet, using the fore feetas hands.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is supposed that the white mouse of Pontus, mentioned also byAristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 17, is the ermine, or else the marten;but, as Cuvier remarks, Ajasson, vol. vi. p. 457, Lemaire, vol. iii. p. 467,the ermine does not hibernate.—B.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier, <hi rend="ital">ubi supra,</hi> conceives that the Alpine mouse is the marmot;but he remarks, that it is inferior in size to the badger.—B.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier, <hi rend="ital">ubi supra,</hi> conceives the Egyptian mouse to be the jerboa,the Musjaculus of Linnæus; but it is much smaller than the marmot.Pliny, in B. x. c. 85, says, that the Egyptian mouse walks on two feet, asdoes the mouse of the Alps. Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. vii. c. 37, andÆlian, Anim. Nat. B. xv. c. 26, refer to the mouse of Egypt.—B. Probably the Mus cahirinus.</p></body>
