(4).—REMARKS IN DISPRAISE OF THE PRACTICES OF MAGIC.</head><p>But above all things, it was the follies of magic more particularly that contributed so essentially to his success—follieswhich had been carried to such a pitch as to destroy all confidence in the remedial virtues of plants. Thus, for instance,it was stoutly maintained that by the agency of the plant aethiopis<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> rivers and standing waters could be dried up, and that bythe very touch<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> * * * * all bars and doors might be opened:that if the plant achænis<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> were thrown into the ranks of theenemy it would be certain to create a panic and put them toflight: that latace<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> was given by the Persian kings to theirambassadors, to ensure them an abundant supply of everything wherever they might happen to be: with numerousother reveries of a similar nature. Where, I should like toknow, were all these plants, when the Cimbri and Teutonesbrought upon us the horrors of warfare with their terrific yells?or when Lucullus defeated, with a few legions, so many kingswho ruled over the Magi?<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> Why is it too that the Romangenerals have always made it their first care in warfare tomake provision for the victualling of their troops? And howwas it that at Pharsalia the troops of Cæsar were suffering fromfamine, if an abundance of everything could have been ensuredby the fortunate possession of a single plant? Would it not havebeen better too for Scipio Æmilianus to have opened the gatesof Carthage by touching them with a herb, than to have takenso many years to batter down its bulwarks with his engines ofwar?</p><p>Turning to the present moment, let them, by the agency ofthe herb meroïs,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> dry up the Pomptine<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> Marshes, if they can,<pb n="5160" />and by these means restore so much territory to the regions ofItaly in the neighbourhood of our city. In the works, too, ofDemocritus, already mentioned,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> we find a recipe for the composition of a medicament which will ensure the procreation ofissue, both sure to be good and fortunate.—What king of Persia,pray, ever obtained that blessing? It really would be a marvellous fact that human credulity, taking its rise originally inthe very soundest of notions, should have ultimately arrived atsuch a pitch as this, if the mind of man understood, under anycircumstances, how to keep within the bounds of moderation; and if the very system of medicine thus introduced byAsclepiades, had not been carried to a greater pitch of extravagance than the follies of magic even, an assertion whichI shall prove on a more appropriate occasion.<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span></p><p>Such, however, is the natural constitution of the humanmind, that, be the circumstances what they may, commencingwith what is necessary it speedily arrives at the point oflaunching out in excess.</p><p>We will now resume our account of the medicinal propertiesof the plants mentioned in the preceding Book, adding to ourdescription such others as the necessities of the case may seemto require.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxiv. c. 102.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We agree with Pintianus that the name of some plant here has beenlost, the word "condiendis" making no sense.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxiv. c. 102.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Some plant as fictitious as the others here mentioned.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxx. c. i.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See 1. xxiv.c. 102</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. ii. c. c.9.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. xxiv. c. 102.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. xxix. c. 5.</p></body>
