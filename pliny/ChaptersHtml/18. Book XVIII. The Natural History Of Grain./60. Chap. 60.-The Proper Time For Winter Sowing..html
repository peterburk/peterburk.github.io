<div2 type="chapter" n="60" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 60.—THE PROPER TIME FOR WINTER SOWING.</head><p>Most persons anticipate the proper time for sowing, and begin toput in the corn immediately after the eleventh day ofthe autumnal equinox, at the rising of the Crown, when wemay reckon, almost to a certainty, upon several days of rainyweather in succession. Xenophon<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> is of opinion, that sowingshould not be commenced until the Deity has given us thesignal for it, a term by which Cicero understands the rains thatprevail in November. The true method to be adopted, however, is notto sow until the leaves begin to fall. Some persons are of opinionthat this takes place at the setting of the<pb n="4080" />Vergiliæ, or the third day before the ides of November, asalready stated,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and they carefully observe it, for it is aconstellation very easily remarked in the heavens, and warns usto resume our winter clothes.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> Hence it is, that immediatelyon its setting, the approach of winter is expected, and care istaken by those who are on their guard against the exorbitantcharges of the shop-keepers, to provide themselves with anappropriate dress. If the Vergiliæ set with cloudy weather,it forebodes a rainy winter, and the prices of cloaks<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>immediately rise; but if, on the other hand, the weather is clear atthat period, a sharp winter is to be expected, and then theprice of garments of other descriptions is sure to go up. Butas to the husbandman, unacquainted as he is with the phænomena ofthe heavens, his brambles are to him in place ofconstellations, and if he looks at the ground he sees it coveredwith their leaves. This fall of the leaves, earlier in one placeand later in another, is a sure criterion of the temperature ofthe weather; for there is a great affinity between the effectsproduced by the weather in this respect, and the nature of thesoil and climate. There is this peculiar advantage, too, in thecareful observation of these effects, that they are sure to beperceptible throughout the whole earth, while at the same timethey have certain features which are peculiar to each individuallocality.—A person may perhaps be surprised at this, who doesnot bear in mind that the herb pennyroyal,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> which is hung upin our larders, always blossoms on the day of the winter solstice; sofirmly resolved is Nature that nothing shall remainconcealed from us, and in that spirit has given us the fall ofthe leaf as the signal for sowing.</p><p>Such is the true method of interpreting all these phenomena,granted to us by Nature as a manifestation of her will. Itis in this way that she warns us to prepare the ground, makesus a promise of a manure, as it were, in the fall of the leaves,announces to us that the earth and the productions thereof arethus protected by her against the cold, and warns us to hastenthe operations of agriculture.<pb n="4081" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In his Œconomica.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. ii. c. 47.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Vestis institor est."
