<div2 type="chapter" n="24" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 24.—THE HELLESPONT.—THE LAKE MÆOTIS.</head><p>The fourth great Gulf of Europe begins at the Hellespontand ends at the entrance of the Mæotis<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>. But in orderthat the several portions of the Euxine and its coasts maybe the better known, we must briefly embrace the formof it in one general view. This vast sea, lying in front ofAsia, is shut out from Europe by the projection of the shoresof the Chersonesus, and effects an entrance into those countries by a narrow channel only, of the width, as alreadymentioned, of seven stadia, thus separating Europe fromAsia. The entrance of these Straits is called the Hellespont; over itXerxes, the king of the Persians, constructed a bridge of boats,across which he led his army.A narrow channel extends thence a distance of eighty-sixmiles, as far as Priapus<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>, a city of Asia, at which Alexanderthe Great passed over. At this point the sea becomeswider, and after some distance again takes the form of anarrow strait. The wider part is known as the Propontis<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>,the Straits as the Thracian Bosporus<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, being only half-a-mile in width, at the place where Darius, the father ofXerxes, led his troops across by a bridge. The extremity ofthis is distant from the Hellespont 239 miles.</p><p>We then come to the vast sea called the Euxine, whichinvades the land as it retreats afar, and the name of whichwas formerly Axenus<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>. As the shores bend inwards, thissea with a vast sweep stretches far away, curving on bothsides after the manner of a pair of horns, so much so that inshape it bears a distinct resemblance to a Scythian bow<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>.<pb n="1327" />In the middle of the curve it is joined by the mouth ofLake Mæotis, which is called the Cimmerian<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> Bosporus,and is two miles and a half in width. Between the twoBospori, the Thracian and the Cimmerian, there is a distancein a straight line, of 500 miles, as Polybius informs us. Welearn from Varro and most of the ancient writers, that thecircumference of the Euxine is altogether 2150 miles; butto this number Cornelius Nepos adds 350 more; whileArtemidorus makes it 2919 miles, Agrippa 2360, and Mucianus 2425. Ina similar manner some writers have fixedthe length of the European shores of this sea at 1478 miles,others again at 1172. M. Varro gives the measurement asfollows:—from the mouth of the Euxine to Apollonia 187miles, and to Callatis the same distance; thence to themouth of the Ister 125 miles; to the Borysthenes 250; toChersonesus<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>, a town of the Heracleotæ, 325; toPanticapæum<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>, by some called Bosporus, at the very extremityofthe shores of Europe, 212 miles: the whole of which addedtogether, makes <date value="1337" authname="1337">1337</date><span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> miles. Agrippa makes the distancefrom Byzantium to the river Ister 560 miles, and fromthence to Panticapæum, 635.</p><p>Lake Mæotis, which receives the river Tanais as it flowsfrom the Riphæan Mountains<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>, and forms the extreme boundarybetween Europe and Asia, is said to be 1406 miles incircumference; which however some writers state at only<date value="1125" authname="1125">1125</date>. From the entrance of this lake to the mouth of theTanais in a straight line is, it is generally agreed, a distanceof 375 miles.</p><p>The inhabitants of the coasts of this fourth great Gulf of<pb n="1328" />Europe, as far as Istropolis, have been already<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> mentioned inour account of Thrace. Passing beyond that spot we cometo the mouths of the Ister. This river rises in Germany inthe heights of Mount Abnoba<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>, opposite to Rauricum<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>, atown of Gaul, and flows for a course of many miles beyondthe Alps and through nations innumerable, under the nameof the Danube. Adding immensely to the volume of itswaters, at the spot where it first enters Illyricum, it assumesthe name of Ister, and, after receiving sixty rivers, nearlyone half of which are navigable, rolls into the Euxine bysix<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> vast channels. The first of these is the mouth ofPeuce<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span>, close to which is the island of Peuce itself, fromwhich the neighbouring channel takes its name; this mouthis swallowed up in a great swamp nineteen miles in length.From the same channel too, above Istropolis, a lake<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> takesits rise, sixty-three miles in circuit; its name is Halmyris.The second mouth is called Naracu-Stoma<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span>; the third, whichis near the island of Sarmatica, is called Calon-Stoma<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span>; thefourth is known as Pseudo-Stomon<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span>, with its islandcalled Conopon-Diabasis<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span>; after which come the Boreon-<pb n="1329" />Stoma<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> and the Psilon-Stoma<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span>. These mouths are each ofthem so considerable, that for a distance of forty miles, it issaid, the saltness of the sea is quite overpowered, and thewater found to be fresh.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now generally known as the Palus Mæotis or Sea of Azof.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The modern Caraboa, according to Brotier, stands on its site.Priapus was the tutelary divinity of Lampsacus in thisvicinity.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "entrance of Pontus"; now the Sea of Marmora.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Ox Ford," or "passage of the cow," Io being said to have crossedit in that form: now called the "Straits of Constantinople."</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Said to have been called <foreign lang="greek">a)/cenos</foreign> or "inhospitable,"from its frequentstorms and the savage state of the people living on its shores.
