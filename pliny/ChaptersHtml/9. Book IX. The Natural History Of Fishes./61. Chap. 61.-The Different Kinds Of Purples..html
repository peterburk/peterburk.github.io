<div2 type="chapter" n="61" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 61.—THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF PURPLES.</head><p>Were I at this point to pass on to other subjects, luxury, nodoubt would think itself defrauded of its due, and so accuseme of negligence; I must therefore make my way into thevery workshops even, so that, just as among articles of foodthe various kinds and qualities of corn are known, all thosewho place the enjoyment of life in these luxuries, may havea still better acquaintance with the objects for which theylive.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span><pb n="2444" /></p><p>There are two kinds of fish that produce the purple colour;the elements in both are the same, the combinations only aredifferent; the smaller fish is that which is called the "buccinum," from its resemblance to the conch by which the soundof the buccinus or trumpet is produced, and to this circumstance it owes its name: the opening in it is round, with anincision in the margin.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> The other fish is known as the"purpura," or purple, and has a grooved and projecting muzzle, which being tubulated on one side in the interior, formsa passage for the tongue;<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> besides which, the shell is studdedwith points up to the very apex, which are mostly seven innumber, and disposed<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> in a circle; these are not found on thebuccinum, though both of them have as many spirals as theyare years old. The buccinum attaches itself only to crags,and is gathered about rocky places.</p><p>(37.) Purples also have another name, that of "pelagiæ<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>there are numerous kinds of them, which differ only in theirelement and place of abode. There is the mud<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> purple, whichis nurtured upon putrid mud; and the sea-weed<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> purple, whichfeeds on sea-weed; both of which are held in the very lowestesteem. A better kind is the reef-purple,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> which is collectedon the reefs or out at sea; still, however, the colour extractedfrom this is too light and thin. Then, again, there is the varietyknown as the pebble-purple,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> so called from the pebbles ofthe sea, and wonderfully well adapted for dyeing; and, better<pb n="2445" />than any of them, that known by the name of "dialutensis,"<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>because of the various natures of the soil on which it feeds.Purples are taken with a kind of osier kipe<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> of small size, andwith large meshes; these are cast into the sea, and in themcockles are put as a bait, that close the shell in an instant,and snap at an object, just as we see mussels do. Though halfdead, these animals, as soon as ever they are returned to thesea, come to life again, and open their shells with avidity;upon which the purples seek them, and commence the attack,by protruding their tongues. The cockles, on the other hand,the moment they feel themselves pricked, shut their shells,and hold fast the object that has wounded them: in this way,victims to their greediness, they are drawn up to the surfacehanging by the tongue.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Præmia vitæ suæs."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier says that the buccini, properly so called, have at the bottom ofthe orifice of the shell an incision, which is the characteristic of the genus.Our whelks are the best known specimen of the buccinum that we have.They received their name, he says, from the buccinum, or buccina, the conchshell. (with which Triton is commonly painted), and that in its turn was socalled from its resemblance to a buccina, trumpet or herdsman's horn.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is not the tongue, Cuvier says, that occupies this passage, but aprolongation of the skin or coat that envelopes the animal, and its officeis to conduct to the branchiæ the water necessary for the purposes of respiration.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This description, Cuvier says, is applicable to the Murex brandaris,the Murex tribulus of Linnæus, and other species that denote their growthby the increase of the spirals furnished with spines.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "deep sea" purples.
