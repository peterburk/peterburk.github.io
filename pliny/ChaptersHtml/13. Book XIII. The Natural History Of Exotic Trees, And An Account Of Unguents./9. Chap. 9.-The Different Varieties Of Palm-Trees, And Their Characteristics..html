<div2 type="chapter" n="9" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 9.—THE DIFFERENT VARIETIES OF PALM-TREES, AND THEIRCHARACTERISTICS.</head><p>There are numerous varieties of the palm-tree. In Assyria,and throughout the whole of Persis, the barren kinds are madeuse of for carpenters' work, and the various appliances ofluxury. There are whole forests also of palm-trees adaptedfor cutting,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and which, after they are cut, shoot again from<pb n="3174" />the root; the pith of them towards the top, which is usuallycalled the brain<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> of the tree, is sweet to the taste, and thetree will live even after it has been extracted, which is the casewith no other kind. The name of this tree is "chammereps;"<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>it has a broader and softer leaf than the others, which is extremely useful for various kinds of wickerwork;<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> these trees arevery numerous in Crete, and even more so in Sicily. Thewood of the palm-tree, when ignited, burns both brightly andslowly.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> In some of those that bear fruit,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> the seed of the fruitis shorter than in others, while in some, again, it is longer; insome it is softer than in others, and in some harder; in someit is osseous and crescent-shaped; polished with a tooth, superstition employs the stone as an antidote against charms and fascination. This stone is enclosed in several coats, more or lessin number; sometimes they are of a thick texture, and sometimes very thin.</p><p>Hence it is that we find nine and forty different kinds ofpalm-trees, if any one will be at the trouble of enumerating alltheir various barbarous names, and the different wines that areextracted from them. The most famous of all, are thosewhich, for the sake of distinction, have received the name of"royal" palms, because they were preserved solely by thekings of Persia; these used to grow nowhere but at Babylon,and there only in the garden of Bagöus,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> that being thePersian for an eunuch, several of whom have even reignedover that country! This garden was always carefully retainedwithin<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> the precincts of the royal court.</p><p>In the southern parts of the world, the dates known as<pb n="3175" />"syagri,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> hold the highest rank, and next after them thosethat are called "margarides." These last are short, white,and round, and bear a stronger resemblance to grapes than todates; for which reason it is that they have received theirname, in consequence of their close resemblance to "margaritæ," or pearls. It is said that there is only one tree thatbears them, and that in the locality known as Chora.<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> Thesame is the case also with the tree that bears the syagri. Wehave heard a wonderful story too, relative to this last tree, tothe effect that it dies and comes to life again in a similarmanner to the phoenix, which, it is generally thought, hasborrowed its name from the palm-tree, in consequence of thispeculiarity; at the moment that I am writing this, that treeis still bearing fruit. As for the fruit itself, it is large, hard,and of a rough appearance, and differing in taste from all otherkinds, having a sort of wild flavour peculiar to itself, andnot unlike that of the flesh of the wild boar; it is evidentlythis circumstance from which it has derived its name of"syagrus."</p><p>In the fourth rank are the dates called "sandalides," fromtheir resemblance to a sandal in shape. It is stated, that onthe confines of Æthiopia there are but five of these trees atthe most, no less remarkable for the singular lusciousness oftheir fruit, than for their extreme rarity. Next to these, thedates known as "caryotæ"<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> are the most esteemed, affordingnot only plenty of nutriment, but a great abundance of juice;it is from these that the principal wines<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> are made in theEast; these wines are apt to affect the head, a circumstancefrom which the fruit derives its name. But if these trees areremarkable for their abundance and fruitfulness, it is in Judæathat they enjoy the greatest repute; not, indeed, throughoutthe whole of that territory, but more particularly at Hiericus,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>although those that grow at Archelais, Phaselis, and Livias,vallies in the same territory, are highly esteemed. The more<pb n="3176" />remarkable quality of these is a rich, unctuous juice; they areof a milky consistency, and have a sort of vinous flavour, witha remarkable sweetness, like that of honey. The Nicolaän<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>dates are of a similar kind, but somewhat drier; they areof remarkable size, so much so, indeed, that four of them,placed end to end, will make a cubit in length. A less finekind, but of sister quality to the caryotæ for flavour, are the"adelphides,"<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> hence so called; these come next to them insweetness, but still are by no means their equals. A thirdkind, again, are the patetæ, which abound in juice to excess,so much so, indeed, that the fruit bursts, in its excess of liquor,even upon the parent tree, and presents all the appearance ofhaving been trodden<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> under foot.</p><p>There are numerous kinds of dates also, of a drier nature,which are long and slender, and sometimes of a curved shape.Those of this sort which we consecrate to the worship of thegods are called "chydæi<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> by the Jews, a nation remarkablefor the contempt which they manifest of the divinities. Thosefound all over Thebais and Arabia are dry and small, with ashrivelled body: being parched up and scorched by the constant heat, they are covered with what more nearly resemblesa shell<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> than a skin. In Æthiopia the date is quite brittleeven, so great is the driness of the climate; hence the peopleare able to knead it into a kind of bread, just like so much<pb n="3177" />flour.<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> It grows upon a shrub, with branches a cubit inlength: it has a broad leaf, and the fruit is round, and largerthan an apple. The name of this date is "coïx."<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> It comesto maturity in three years, and there is always fruit to befound upon the shrub, in various stages of maturity. Thedate of Thebais is at once packed in casks, with all its natural heat and freshness; for without this precaution, it quicklybecomes vapid; it is of a poor, sickly taste, too, if it is notexposed, before it is eaten, to the heat of an oven.</p><p>The other kinds of dates appear to be of an ordinary nature,and are generally known as "tragemata;"<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> but in some parts ofPhœnicia and Cilicia, they are commonly called "balani," aname which has been also borrowed by us. There are numerous kinds of them, which differ from one another in beinground or oblong; as also in colour, for some of them are black,and others red-indeed it is said that they present no fewervarieties of colour than the fig: the white ones, however, arethe most esteemed. They differ also in size, according to thenumber which it requires to make a cubit in length; some,indeed, are no larger than a bean. Those are the best adaptedfor keeping which are produced in salt and sandy soils, Sudca,and Cyrenaica in Africa, for instance: those, however, of Egypt,Cyprus, Syria, and Seleucia in Assyria, will not keep: henceit is that they are much used for fattening swine and otheranimals. It is a sign that the fruit is either spoilt or old,when the white protuberance disappears, by which it has adhered to the cluster. Some of the soldiers of Alexander's armywere choked by eating green dates;<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> and a similar effect isproduced in the country of the Gedrosi, by the natural qualityof the fruit; while in other places, again, the same results arisefrom eating them to excess. Indeed, when in a fresh state, theyare so remarkably luscious, that there would be no end to<pb n="3178" />eating them, were it not for fear of the dangerous consequencesthat would be sure to ensue.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Cæduæ." Though this is the fact as to some palm-trees, the greaterpart perish after being cut; the vital bud occupying the summit, and thetrunk not being susceptible of any increase.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cerebrum.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Chamæreps humilis of the modern botanists.

This fruit retained its name of"Nicolaän," down to the middle ages.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny would imply that they are so called from the Greek <foreign lang="greek">a)de/lfia,</foreign>"a sister," as being of sister quality to the caryotæ; but it is much moreprobable, as Fée remarks, that they got this name from being attached inpairs to the same pedicie or stalk.</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny certainly seems to imply that they are so called from the Greek<foreign lang="greek">pate/w,</foreign> "to tread under foot," and Hardouin is of that opinion. Fée,however, thinks the name is from the Hebrew or Syriac "patach," "to expand," or "open," or else from the Hebrew "pathah," the name of the firstvowel, from some fancied resemblance in the form.</p><p><span id="note_17"><a href="#ref_17">17. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From the Greek <foreign lang="greek">xudai=os,</foreign> "vulgar," or "common," it is supposed.
