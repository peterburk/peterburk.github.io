Next to it in blossoming is the plum<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>of Armenia, and then the tuber and the early peach,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> the firsttwo being exotics, and the latter forced by the agency of cultivation. Among the forest trees, the first that blossoms in thecourse of nature is the elder,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> which has the most pith of any,and the male cornel, which has none<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> at all. Among thecultivated trees we next have the apple, and immediately after—so much so, indeed, that it would almost appear that theyblossom simultaneously—the pear, the cherry, and the plum.Next to these is the laurel, and then the cypress, and afterthat the pomegranate and the fig: the vine, too, and the oliveare budding when these last trees are in flower, the period oftheir conception<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> being the rising of the Vergiliæ,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> that being<pb n="3384" />their constellation.<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> As for the vine, it blossoms at the summersolstice, and the olive begins to do so a little later. All blossoms remain on the trees seven days, and never fall sooner;some, indeed, fall later, but none remain on more than twiceseven days. The blossoms are always off before the eighthday<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> of the ides of July, the period of the prevalence of theEtesian<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> winds.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In the last Chapter.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In Paris, Fée says, the almond does not blossom till March.
