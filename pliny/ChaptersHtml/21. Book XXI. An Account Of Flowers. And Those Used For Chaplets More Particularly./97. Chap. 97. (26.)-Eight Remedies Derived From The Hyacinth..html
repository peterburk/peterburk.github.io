(26.)—EIGHT REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE HYACINTH.</head><p>The hyacinth<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> grows in Gaul more particularly, where itis employed for the dye called "hysginum."<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> The root of itis bulbous, and is well known among the dealers in slaves:applied to the body, with sweet wine, it retards the signs ofpuberty,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and prevents them from developing themselves. Itis curative, also, of gripings of the stomach, and of the bites ofspiders, and it acts as a diuretic. The seed is administered,with abrotonum, for the stings of serpents and scorpions, andfor jaundice.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See c. 38 of this Book; also B. xvi. c. 31.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From the herb "hysge," used for dyeing a deep red.
