<div2 type="chapter" n="22" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 22.ÑTHE NATURAL HISTORY OF TWENTY DIFFERENT KINDS OF PLANTS WHICH GROW IN GARDENSÑTHE PROPER METHODS TO BE FOLLOWED IN SOWING THEM RESPECTIVELY.</head><p>Of some plants the fruits<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> are in the earth, of others both inthe earth and out of it, and of others, again, out of the earthsolely. Some of them increase as they lie upon the ground,gourds and cucumbers, for instance; the same products willgrow also in a hanging position, but they are much heaviereven then than any of the fruits that grow upon trees. Thecucumber, however, is composed of cartilage and a fleshy substance, while the gourd consists of rind and cartilage: this lastis the only vegetable production the outer coat of which becomes of a ligneous nature, when ripe. Radishes, turnips,and rape are hidden in the earth, and so, too, are elecampane,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>skirrets,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and parsnips,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> though in a different manner. Thereare some plants, again, to which we shall give the name of"ferulaceous," anise<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> and mallows, for instance; indeed, wefind it stated by some writers that in Arabia<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> the mallow be-<pb n="4156" />comes arborescent at the sixth month, so much so, in fact,as to admit of its being used for walking-sticks. We haveanother instance, again, in the mallow-tree of Mauretania,which is found at Lixus, a city built upon an ¾stuarythere; and at which spot, it is said, were formerly the gardensof the Hesperides, at a distance of two hundred paces from theOcean, near the shrine of Hercules, more ancient, tradition says,than the temple at Gades. This mallow-tree<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> is twenty feetin height, and of such a thickness that there is not a person inexistence who is able with his arms to span its girth.</p><p>In the class of ferulaceous plants we must include hemp<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>also. There are some plants, again, to which we must givethe appellation of "fleshy;"<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> such as those spongy<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> productionswhich are found growing in damp meadows. As to the fungus,with a hard, tough flesh, we have already<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> made mention ofit when speaking of wood and trees; and of truffles, whichform another variety, we have but very recently given a de-scription.<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">By the word "fructus" he no doubt means the edible parts solely,the leaf, stalk, or root, as the case may be.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">FŽe is surprised to find elecampane figuring among the garden vegetables. It has a powerful odour, is bitter, and promotes expectoration.Though not used as a vegetable it is still used as a preserve, or sweetmeat,mixed with sugar. See further on it in c. 29 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See c. 28 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See c. 27 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">FŽe remarks that this juxtaposition of anise and mallows betokensthe most complete ignorance of botany on the part of our author; therebeing few plants which differ more essentially. The field-mallow, orMalva silvestris of Linn¾us, or perhaps several varieties of it, are herereferred to. The anise will be further mentioned in c. 74 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">FŽe suggests that the plant here mentioned may have been an annual,probably the Lavatorea arborea of botanists, or some kindred species. Ina few months it is known to attain a height of ten feet or more.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In FŽe's opinion this tree cannot have belonged to the family of Malvace¾; the Adansonia and some other exotics of the family, with whichPliny undoubtedly was not acquainted, being the only ones that attainthese gigantic proportions.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There is no resemblance between mallows and hemp, any more thanthere is between mallows and anise.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Carnosa."</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hardonin thinks that he alludes to the Conferva, or river sponge.again mentioned in B. xxvii. c. 45. FŽe, however, dissents from thatopinion.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. xvi. cc. 11 and 13, and in cc. 12 and 14 of the present Book.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In c. 11 of the present Book.</p></body>
