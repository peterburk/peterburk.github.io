They say, also, in addition to this, that persons who haveit about them in battle will be sure to display valour. Theydescribe, too, certain remedies made from the egg of this bird forthe hair. But who, pray, has ever had the opportunity ofseeing the egg of a horned owl, considering that it is so highlyominous to see the bird itself?<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> And then besides, who hasever thought proper to make the experiment, and upon his hairmore particularly? In addition to all this, the magicians goso far as to engage to make the hair curl by using the blood ofthe young of the horned owl.</p><p>What they tell us, too, about the bat, appears to belong topretty much the same class of stories: if one of these animals iscarried alive, three times round a house, they say, and thennailed outside of the window with the head downwards, it willhave all the effects of a countercharm: they assert, also, that thebat is a most excellent preservative for sheepfolds, being firstcarried three times round them, and then hung up by the footover the lintel of the door.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> The blood of the bat is alsorecommended by them as a sovereign remedy, in combinationwith a thistle,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> for injuries inflicted by serpents.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxv. c. 97.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The same is said of a frog's tongue, in B. xxxii. c. 18.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">That is no reason, as Ajasson remarks, why the egg should not befound, it being easy to take it from the nest at night, when, the birdbeing absent, no ill omen will arise from seeing it.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We still see bats nailed upon and over stable doors in various partsof this country.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Carduus."</p></body>
