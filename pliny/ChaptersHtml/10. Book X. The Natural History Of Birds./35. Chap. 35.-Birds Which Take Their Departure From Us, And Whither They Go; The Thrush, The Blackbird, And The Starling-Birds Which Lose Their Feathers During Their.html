It is, however,a well-ascertained fact, that the turtle-dove conceals itself, andloses its feathers. The ring-dove, also, takes its departure:and with these too, it is a matter of doubt whither they go.It is a peculiarity of the starling to fly in troops, as it were,and then to wheel round in a globular mass like a ball, thecentral troop acting as a pivot for the rest. Swallows are theonly birds that have a sinuous flight of remarkable velocity;for which reason it is that they are not exposed to the attacksof other birds of prey: these too, in fine, are the only birds thattake their food solely on the wing.</p></div2></body>
