Forthis purpose, fresh lime is selected, which has not been slakedwith water. Its properties are caustic, resolvent, and attractive;and it prevents serpiginous ulcers from spreading, beingincorporated with vinegar and oil of roses, for the purpose.When this has been effected, it is tempered with wax and oil ofroses, and applied to promote cicatrization. In combinationwith honey, and liquid resin, or hogs' lard, lime is curative ofsprains and scrofulous sores.</p></div2></body>
