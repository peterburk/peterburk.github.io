<div2 type="chapter" n="30" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 30.ÑTHE MARVELLOUS OPERATIONS OF NATURE IN SOLDERINGMETALLIC SUBSTANCES, AND BRINGING THEM TO A STATE OFPERFECTION.</head><p>While speaking on this subject, it will be as well to annexthe remaining particulars, that our admiration may here bedrawn to all the marvels presented by Nature in connectiontherewith. The proper solder for gold is that above described;for iron, potter's clay; for copper, when in masses, cadmia,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>and in sheets, alum; for lead and marble, resin. Lead is alsounited by the aid of white lead;<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> white lead with white lead,by the agency of oil; stannum, with copper file-dust; andsilver, with stannum.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span></p><p>For smelting copper and iron, pine-wood is the best, Egyptianpapyrus being also very good for the purpose. Gold ismelted most easily with a fire made of chaff.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> Limestoneand Thracian stone<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> are ignited by the agency of water, thislast being extinguished by the application of oil. Fire, however,is extinguished most readily by the application of vinegar,viscus,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> and unboiled eggs. Earth will under no circumstanceignite. When charcoal has been once quenched, and then againignited, it gives out a greater heat than before.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">As to the "cadmia" of Pliny, see B. xxxiv. c. 22.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Plumbum album."

This stone, which is mentioned also by Nicander,Galen, Simplicius, and Dioscorides, has not been identified. Holland hasthe following Note on this passage: "Which some take for pit-cole, or sea-colerather, such as commeth from Newcastle by sea; or rather, a kind ofjeat (jet)." In either case, he is probably wide of the mark, neither coalnor jet igniting on the application of water.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or mistletoe.</p></body>
