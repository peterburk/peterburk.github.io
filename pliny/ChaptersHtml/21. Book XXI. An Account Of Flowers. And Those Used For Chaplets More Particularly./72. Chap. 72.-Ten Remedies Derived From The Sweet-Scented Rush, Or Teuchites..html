<div2 type="chapter" n="72" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 72.—TEN REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE SWEET-SCENTEDRUSH, OR TEUCHITES.</head><p>We will also take this opportunity of mentioning the medicinal properties of the sweet-scented rush, which is foundin Cœle-Syria, as already stated by us in the appropriateplace<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> The most esteemed kind, however, is that whichgrows in the country of the Nabatæi, and is known as the"teuchites;"<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> the next best being the produce of Babylonia,and the very worst that of Africa, which is entirely destituteof smell. This rush is round, and when applied to the tongue,has a pungent, vinous flavour. The genuine kind, whenrubbed, gives out an odour like that of the rose, and whenbroken asunder it is red within. It dispels flatulency, andhence it is very good for the stomach, and for persons whenvomiting the bile or blood. It arrests hiccup also, promoteseructations, acts as a diuretic, and is curative of affections ofthe bladder. A decoction of it is used for female complaints;and in cases of opisthotony, it is applied in plasters with dryresin, these being highly valued for their warming properties.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">B. xii. c. 48.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Dioscorides says that it grows in Babylonia.
