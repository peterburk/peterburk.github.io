(39.)ÑTHE BIRDS CALLED APODES, OR CYPSELI.</head><p>Those birds which are known as "apodes"<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> fly the most ofall, because they are deprived of the use of their feet. Bysome persons they are called "cypseli." They are a species ofswallow which build their nests in the rocks, and are the samebirds that are to be seen everywhere at sea; indeed, howeverfar a ship may go, however long its voyage, and however greatthe distance from land, the apodes never cease to hover aroundit. Other birds settle and come to a stand, whereas these knowno repose but in the nest; they are always either on the wingor else asleep.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Without feet." This was supposed to be the case with the martinet,the Hirundo apus of Linn¾us.</p></body>
