Judæa, too, is greatly renowned for its perfumes, andeven still more so for its palm-trees,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> the nature of which Ishall take this opportunity of enlarging upon. There are somefound in Europe also. They are not uncommon in Italy, butare quite barren there.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> The palms on the coast of Spain bearfruit, but it is sour.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> The fruit of those of Africa is sweet,but quickly becomes vapid and loses its flavour; which, however is not the case with the fruit of those that grow in theEast.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> From these trees a wine is made, and bread by somenations,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> and they afford an aliment for numerous quadrupeds.It will be with very fair reason then, that we shall confine ourdescription to the palm-tree of foreign countries. There are<pb n="3170" />none in Italy that grow spontaneously,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> nor, in fact, in anyother part of the world, with the exception of the warm countries: indeed, it is only in the very hottest climates that thistree will bear fruit.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Capua, its capital, was the great seat of the unguent and perfumemanufacture in Italy.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Phœnix dactylifera of Linnæus. See also B. xii. c. 62, where heseems also to allude to this tree.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">At the present day this is not the fact. The village of La Bordighiera,situate on an eminence of the Apennines, grows great quantities of dates,of good quality. At Hieres, Nice, San Remo, and Genoa, they are alsogrown.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This, too, is not the fact. The dates of Valencia, Seville, and otherprovinces of Spain, are sweet, and of excellent quality.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny is wrong again in this statement. The date of Barbary, Tunis,Algiers, and Bildulgerid, the "land of dates," is superior in every respectto that of the East.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Æthiopians, as we learn from Theophrastus, B. ii. c. 8.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or in a wild state.</p></body>
