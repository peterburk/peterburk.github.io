<div2 type="chapter" n="35" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 35.—TWENTY-FIVE REMEDIES DERIVED FROM BUTTER.</head><p>From milk, too, butter is produced; held as the most delicateof food among barbarous<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> nations, and one which distinguishes<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>the wealthy from the multitude at large. It is mostly madefrom cows' milk, and hence its name;<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> but the richest butteris that made from ewes' milk. There is a butter made alsofrom goats' milk; but previously to making it, the milk shouldfirst be warmed, in winter. In summer it is extracted fromthe milk by merely shaking it to and fro in a tall vessel, witha small orifice at the mouth to admit the air, but otherwiseclosely stopped, a little water<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> being added to make it curdlethe sooner. The milk that curdles the most, floats upon the surface; this they remove, and, adding salt to it, give it the nameof "oxygala."<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> They then take the remaining part and boilit down in pots, and that portion of it which floats on thesurface is butter, a substance of an oily nature. The more<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>rank it is in smell, the more higthly it is esteemed. When old,it forms an ingredient in numerous compositions. It is of anastringent, emollient, repletive, and purgative nature.<pb n="5324" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The people of Germany and Scythia, for instance.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In this passage also it is generally supposed that he refers to thenomadic life of barbarous nations, in which multitudes of sheep andcattle constituted the chief wealth. It is, however, not improbable thathe means to say that among the Romans it was only the wealthy who couldafford to use it.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot"><foreign lang="greek">Bou/turon,</foreign> "cow cheese."</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Qy. whether for "aquæ" "water," we should not read "acidi"here, "sour milk," as at the beginning of the next Chapter Beckmannsuggests "aceti," "vinegar."—<hi rend="ital">Hist.

Inv.</hi> I. 505. He suggests anotherarrangement of the whole passage, but without improving it, for the difficulty would appear to be totally imaginary; as it is quite clear that by"oxygala," or "sour milk," Pliny means the thickest part of the curd,which is first removed and then salted, forming probably a sort of creamcheese. Though his meaning is clear, he may very possibly give anerroneous description of the process.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The remark of Holland on this passage is curious—"Some wouldamend this place, and for 'magis,' 'more,' put 'minus,' 'less,' in a contrary sense; but I suppose he writeth in regard of barbarous people, whomake more account of such ranke butyr; like as the uncivile Irish inthese daies."</p></body>
