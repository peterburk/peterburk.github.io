<div2 type="chapter" n="90" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 90.ÑWHICH FISHES HAVE THE FINEST SENSE OF SMELL.</head><p>It is quite manifest that fishes have the sense of smell also;for they are not all to be taken with the same bait, and are seento smell at it before they seize it. Some, too, that are concealed in the bottom of holes, are driven out by the fisherman,by the aid of the smell of salted fish; with this he rubs theentrance of their retreat in the rock, immediately upon whichthey take to flight from the spot, just as though they had recognized the dead carcases of those of their kind. Then, again,they will rise to the surface at the smell of certain odours,such, for instance as roasted s¾pia and polypus; and hence itis that these baits are placed in the osier kipes used for takingfish. They immediately take to flight upon smelling the bilge<pb n="2548" />water in a ship's hold, and more especially upon scenting theblood of fish.</p><p>The polypus cannot possibly be torn away from the rock towhich it clings; but upon the herb cunila<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> being applied, theinstant it smells it the fish quits its hold. Purples also aretaken by means of fetid substances. And then, too, as to theother kinds of animals, who is there that can feel any doubt?Serpents are driven away by the smell of harts' horns, andmore particularly by that of storax. Ants, too, are killed bythe odours of origanum, lime, or sulphur. Gnats are attractedby acids, but not by anything sweet.</p><p>(71.) All animals have the sense of touch, those even whichhave no other sense; for even in the oyster, and, among landanimals, in the worm, this sense is found.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A species of origanum.</p></body>
