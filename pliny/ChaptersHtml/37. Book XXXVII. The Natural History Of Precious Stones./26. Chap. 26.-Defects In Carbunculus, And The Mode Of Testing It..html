It is possible, they say, to heightenthe brilliancy of dull stones, by steeping them for fourteendays in vinegar, this adventitious lustre being retained by them<pb n="6423" />as many months. They are counterfeited, too, with great exactnessin glass; but the difference may be detected with thetouchstone; the same being the case also with other artificialstones, as the material is always of a softer nature and comparativelybrittle. When thus tested by the stone, hard knots,too, are detected in them; and the weight of the glass counterfeitis always less. In some cases, too, they present small blisterswithin, which shine like silver.</p></div2></body>
