(13.)ÑPOMPHOLYX.</head><p>The substances called pompholyx<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and spodos<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> are alsofound in the furnaces of copper-smelting works; the differencebetween them being, that pompholyx is disengaged by washing,while spodos is not washed. Some persons have called thepart which is white and very light "pompholyx," and say thatit is the ashes of copper and cadmia; whereas spodos is darkerand heavier, being a substance scraped from the walls of thefurnace, mixed with extinguished sparks from the metal, andsometimes with the residue of coals. When vinegar is combinedwith it, pompholyx emits a coppery smell, and if it is touchedwith the tongue, the taste is most abominable. It is useful asan ingredient in ophthalmic preparations for all diseases of theeyes, as also for all the purposes for which spodos is used;this last only differing from it in its action being less powerful.It is also used for plasters, when required to be gentlycooling and desiccative. For all these purposes it is moreefficacious when it has been moistened with wine</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is difficult to ascertain the exact nature of the substances treatedof in this Chapter. Ajasson has some judicious remarks upon them, inwhich he points out what appear to be inconsistencies in the account givenof them, and of their relation to each other.ÑB. Ajasson says that thereis no doubt that a mammose or terreous carbonate of copper is meantunder these names. These substances are no longer known, but our tutty,or impure oxide of zinc, bears some resemblance to them.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xix. c. 4, and Chapters 34 and 52 of this Book.</p></body>
