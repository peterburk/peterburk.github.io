<div2 type="chapter" n="5" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 5.—REMARKABLE FACTS CONNECTED WITH THEPLANE-TREE.</head><p>The first plane-trees that were spoken of in terms of highadmiration were those which adorned the walks of the Academy<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> at Athens-[in one of which], the roots extended a distance of thirty-three cubits, and spread far beyond its branches.At the present day, there is a very famous plane in Lycia,situate in close proximity to a fountain of the most refreshing coolness; standing near the road, with the cavity in its<pb n="3105" />interior, it forms a species of house eighty-one feet in width.Its summit, too, presents the foliage of a grove, while it shieldsitself with huge branches, each of which would equal an ordinary tree in size, as it throws its lengthened shade across thefields. In addition to this, that nothing may be wanting toits exact resemblance to a grotto, there is a circle of seatswithin, formed of stone, intermingled with pumice overgrownwith moss. This tree was looked upon as so worthy of remark,that Licinius Mucianus, who was three times consul, and recently the legatus of that province, thought it a circumstancedeserving of transmission even to posterity, that he, togetherwith eighteen persons of his retinue, had sat down to a banquetin the interior of it. Its leaves afforded material for theircouches in the greatest abundance, while he himself, shelteredfrom every gust of wind, and trying in vain to hear the pattering of the rain on the leaves, took his meal there, and enjoyed himself more than he would have done amid the resplendence of marble, a multiplicity of paintings, and beneath acieling refulgent with gold.</p><p>Another curious instance, again, was that afforded in thereign of the Emperor Caius.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> That prince was so struck withadmiration on seeing a plane in the territory of Veliternum,which presented floor after floor, like those of the several storiesof a house, by means of broad benches loosely laid from branchto branch, that he held a banquet in it-himself adding<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> verymaterially to the shade it threw-the triclinium being formedfor the reception of fifteen guests and the necessary attendants:to this singular dining-room he gave the name of his "nest."</p><p>At Gortyna, in the Isle of Crete, there is, in the vicinity ofa fountain there, a single plane-tree, which has been long celebrated in the records of both the Greek and the Latin language:it never loses<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> its leaves, and from an early period one of thefabulous legends of Greece has been attached to it, to the effectthat it was beneath this tree that Jupiter lay with Europa;just as if there had not been another tree of a similar nature<pb n="3106" />in the island of Cyprus. Slips of the tree at Gortyna—sofond is man by nature of novelty—were at an early periodplanted at different places in Crete, and reproduced the naturalimperfections of the tree;<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> though, indeed, there is no higherrecommendation in the plane than the fact that in summer itprotects us from the rays of the sun, while in winter it admitsthem. In later times, during the reign of the EmperorClaudius, a Thessalian eunuch, the freedman of MarcellusÆserninus,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> who, however, from motives of ambition had enrolled himself in the number of the freedmen of the emperor,and had acquired very considerable wealth, introduced thisplane into Italy, in order to beautify his country-seat: so thathe may not inappropriately be styled a second Dionysius.These monstrosities of other lands are still to be seen in Italy,independently of those which that country has herself devised.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Situate near the sea-shore.
