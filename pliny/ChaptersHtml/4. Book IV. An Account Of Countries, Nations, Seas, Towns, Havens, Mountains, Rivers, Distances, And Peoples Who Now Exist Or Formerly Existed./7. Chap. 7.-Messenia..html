Then, the towns of Pylos<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and Methone<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>,the place where Helos stood, the Promontory of Acritas<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>,the Asinæan Gulf, which takes its name from the town ofAsine<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>, and the Coronean, so called from Corone; which gulfsterminate at the Promontory of Tanarum<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>. These are all inthe country of Messenia, which has eighteen mountains, andthe river Pamisus<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> also. In the interior are Messene<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>, Ithome,Œchalia, Arene<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>, Pteleon, Thryon, Dorion<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>, andZancle<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>,all of them known to fame at different periods. The marginof this gulf measures eighty miles, the distance across beingthirty.<pb n="1283" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This city survived through the middle ages, when it was calledArkadia.

Grisso, or, according to some, Iaratcha,occupies its site. Koroni however is most probably the spot where itstood, the inhabitants of ancient Corone having removed to it. Petalidhistands on the site of Corone. A small portion of the Messenian Gulfwas probably called the Coronean.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Cape Matapan.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now the Pyrnatza.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Its ruins, which are extensive, are to be seen in the vicinity of themodern village of Mavromati.
