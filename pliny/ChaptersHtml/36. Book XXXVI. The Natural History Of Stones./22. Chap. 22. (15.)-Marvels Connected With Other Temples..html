Theresult is, that the interstices quite glisten with their fine,hair-like threads; and the reflection of the gold, obscured as itis, gently falling upon the statues, besides proclaiming thegenius of the artist, heightens their effect, and so teaches usto appreciate the costliness of the work.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. v. c. 40.</p></body>
