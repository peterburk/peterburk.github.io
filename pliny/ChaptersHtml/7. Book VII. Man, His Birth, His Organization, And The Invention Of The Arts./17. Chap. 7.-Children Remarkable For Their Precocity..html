Wehear, also, that he died suddenly of convulsions of the limbs,at the completion of his third year.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> myself, not very longago, was witness to exactly similar appearances, with the exception of the state of puberty, in a son of Cornelius Tacitus,a member of the equestrian order, and procurator<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> of BelgicGaul.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> The Greeks call such children as these, <foreign lang="greek">Extrape/loi;</foreign>we have no name for them in Latin.</p><p>(17.) It has been observed, that the height of a man fromthe crown of the head to the sole of the foot, is equal to thedistance between the tips of the middle fingers of the two handswhen extended in a straight line; the right side of the body,too, is generally stronger than the left; though in some, thestrength of the two sides is equal; while in others again, theleft side is the strongest. This, however, is never found to bethe case in women.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Seneca also mentions him in his Consolation to Marcia, c. 23.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The procurator of a province was an officer appointed by the Cæsar toperform the duties discharged by the quæstor in the other provinces.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We have an ingenious dissertation by Ajasson, the object of which isto show, that the Tacitus here referred to, is not the historian, but hisfather, and consequently, that the boy prematurely born must have beenthe historian's brother, not his son.—B.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is not clear whether Pliny intended to apply all these three observations to the female, or only the last of them; it appears, however, thatthe remark is, in either case, without foundation.—B. He appears to intend that his observations should apply more especially to the strength ofthe arm.</p></body>
