That which has at the extremity five<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>points at the utmost, is called "dactylos." Twisting thesepoints together, persons introduce them into the nostrils and thenwithdraw them, with the view of preventing hæmorrhage.The second kind, which resembles aizoön,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> is employed withaxle-grease for whitlows and hangnails, and for fleshy excrescences upon the nails: this also is called "dactylos," becauseit is so useful as a remedy for diseases of the fingers.</p><p>The third<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> kind, which is also known as "dactylos," is morediminutive, and is found growing upon walls or tiles. It hascertain caustic properties, and arrests the progress of serpigi-nous ulcers. By placing a wreath of gramen round the head,bleeding at the nose is stopped. In Babylonia, it is said, thegramen<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> which grows by the wayside is fatal to camels.<pb n="5074" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Fée is somewhat at a loss as to its identity, but thinks that it may bethe Panicum sanguinale of Linnæus, or possibly the Cynodon dactylon;.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See 13. xix. c. 58, and B. xxv. c. 102.
