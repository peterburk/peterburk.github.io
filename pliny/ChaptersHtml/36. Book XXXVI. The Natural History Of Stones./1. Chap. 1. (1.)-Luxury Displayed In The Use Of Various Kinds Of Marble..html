<div2 type="chapter" n="1" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 1. (1.)â€”LUXURY DISPLAYED IN THE USE OF VARIOUS KINDSOF MARBLE.</head><p>IT now remains for us to speak of stones, or, in other words,the leading folly of the day; to say nothing at all of our tastefor gems and amber, crystal and murrhine vases.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> For everythingof which we have previously treated, down to thepresent Book, may, by some possibility or other, have the appearanceof having been created for the sake of man: but asto the mountains, Nature has made those for herself, as a kindof bulwark for keeping together the bowels of the earth; asalso for the purpose of curbing the violence of the rivers, ofbreaking the waves of the sea, and so, by opposing to themthe very hardest of her materials, putting a check upon thoseelements which are never at rest. And yet we must hewdown these mountains, forsooth, and carry them off; and this,for no other reason than to gratify our luxurious inclinations:heights which in former days it was reckoned a miracle even tohave crossed!</p><p>Our forefathers regarded as a prodigy the passage of theAlps, first by Hannibal,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and, more recently, by the Cimbri:but at the present day, these very mountains are cut asunderto yield us a thousand different marbles, promontories arethrown open to the sea, and the face of Nature is being everywherereduced to a level. We now carry away the barriersthat were destined for the separation of one nation fromanother; we construct ships for the transport of our marbles;and, amid the waves, the most boisterous element of Nature,we convey the summits of the mountains to and fro: a thing,however, that is even less unpardonable than to go on the<pb n="6306" />search amid the regions of the clouds for vessels<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> with whichto cool our draughts, and to excavate rocks, towering to thevery heavens, in order that we may have the satisfaction ofdrinking from ice! Let each reflect, when he hears of thehigh prices set upon these things, when he sees these ponderousmasses carted and carried away, how many there are whoselife is passed far more happily without them. For whatutility or for what so-called pleasure do mortals make themselvesthe agents, or, more truly speaking, the victims of suchundertakings, except in order that others may take their reposein the midst of variegated stones? Just as though too, theshades of night, which occupy one half of each man's existence,would forbear to curtail these imaginary delights.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxxvii. cc. 7, 8, 11.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See the lines of Juvenal, Sat. x. 1. 151, <hi rend="ital">et seq.</hi></p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He alludes to vessels made of crystal, which, as Dalechamps remarks,was long supposed to be nothing but ice in a concrete form.
