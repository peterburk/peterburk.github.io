<div2 type="chapter" n="10" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 10.—THE HISTORY OF the VARIOUS KINDS OF GRAIN.</head><p>The cereals are divided again into the same number ofvarieties, according to the time of the year at which theyare sown. The winter grains are those which are put inthe ground about the setting of the Vergiliæ,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and there receive their nutriment throughout the winter, for instance,wheat,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> spelt,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and barley.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> The summer grains are thosewhich are sown in summer, before the rising of the Vergiliæ,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span><pb n="4020" />such as millet,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> panic,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> sesame,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> horminum,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> and irio,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> inaccordance, however, with the usage of Italy only; for inGreece and Asia all the grains are sown just after the setting ofthe Vergiliæ. There are some, again, that aræ sown at eitherseason in Italy, and others at a third period, or, ill otherwords, in the spring. Some authors give the name of spring-grain to millet, panic, lentils,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> chick-peas,<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> and alica,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>while they call wheat, barely, beans, turnips, and rape, sementive or early sowing seeds. Certain species of wheat are onlysown to make fodder for cattle, and are known by the name of"farrago,"<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> or mixed grain; the same, too, with the leguminous plants, the vetch, for instance. The lupine.<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> however, isgrown in common as food for both cattle and men.</p><p>All the leguminous<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> plants, with the exception of the bean,have a single root, hard and tough, like wood, and destitute ofnumerous ramifications; the chick-pea has the deepest root ofall. Corn has numerous fibrous roots, but no ramifications.Barley makes its appearance<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> above ground the seventh dayafter sowing; the leguminous plants on the fourth, or at thevery latest, the seventh; the bean from the fifteenth day tothe twentieth: though in Egypt the leguminous plants appearas early as the third day after they are sown. In barley, oneextremity of the grain throws out the root, and the other the<pb n="4021" />blade; this last flowers, too, before the other grain. In thecereals in general it is the thicker end of the seed that throwsout the root, the thinner end the blossom; while in the otherseeds both root and blossom issue from the same part.</p><p>During the winter, corn is in the blade; but in the springwinter corn throws out a tall stem. As for millet and panic,they grow with a jointed and grooved<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> stalk, while sesame hasa stem resembling that of fennel-giant. The fruit of all theseseeds is either contained in an ear, as in wheat and barley, forinstance, and protected from the attacks of birds and smallanimals by a prickly beard bristling like so many plisades; orelse it is enclosed in pods, as in the leguminous plants, or incapsules, as in sesame and the poppy. Millet and panic canonly be said to belong to the grower and the small birds incommon, as they have nothing but a thin membrane to coverthem, without the slightest protection. Panic receives thatname from the panicule<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> or down that is to be seen upon it;the head of it droops languidly, and the stalk tapers gradually in thickness, being of almost the toughness and consistency of wood: the head is loaded with grain closely packed,there being a tuft upon the top, nearly a foot in length. Inmillet the husks which embrace the grain bend downward witha wavy tuft upon the edge. There are several varieties ofpanic, the mammose, for instance, the ears of which are inclusters with small edgings of down, the head of the plantbeing double; it is distinguished also according to the colour,the white, for instance, the black, the red, and the purpleeven. Several kinds of bread are made from millet, but verylittle from panic: there is no grain known that weighs heavierthan millet, and which swells more in baking. A modius ofmillet will yield sixty pounds' weight of bread; and threesextarii steeped in water will make one modius of fermenty.<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span>A kind of millet<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> has been introduced from India into Italywithin the last ten years, of a swarthy colour, large grain, and a<pb n="4022" />stalk like that of the reed. This stalk springs up to the heightof seven feet, and has tufts of a remarkable size, known by thename of "phobæ."<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> This is the most prolific of all the cereals,for from a single grain no less than three sextarii<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span> are produced: it requires, however, to be sown in a humid soil.</p><p>Some kinds of corn begin to form the ear at the third joint,and others at the fourth, though at its first formation the earremains still concealed. Wheat, however, has four<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span> articulations, spelt<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span> six, and barley eight. In the case of these last,the ear does not begin to form before the number of joints, asabove mentioned, is complete. Within four or five days, atthe very latest, after the ear has given signs of forming, theplant begins to flower, and in the course of as many days or alittle more, sheds its blossom: barley blossoms at the end ofseven days at the very latest. Varro says that the grains areperfectly formed at the end of four times<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span> nine days from theirflowering, and are ready for cutting at the ninth month.</p><p>The bean, again, first appears in leaf, and then throws outa stalk, which has no articulations<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span> upon it. The other legu-minous plants have a tough, ligneous stalk, and some of themthrow out branches, the chick-pea, the fitch, and the lentil,for instance. In some of the leguminous plants, the pea, forexample, the stem creeps along the ground, if care is not takento support it by sticks: if this precaution is omitted, thequality is deteriorated. The bean and the lupine are the onlyones among the leguminous plants that have a single stem: inall the others the stem throws out branches, being of a ligneous nature, very thin, and in all cases hollow. Some ofthese plants throw out the leaves from the root, others at thetop.<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span> Wheat, barley, and the vetch, all the plants, in fact,which produce straw, have a single leaf only at the summit:in barley, however, this leaf is rough, while in the others it<pb n="4023" />is smooth. * * * In the bean, again, the chick-pea, and thepea, the leaves are numerous and divided. In corn the leafis similar to that of the reed, while in the bean it is round, asalso in a great proportion of the leguminous plants. In theervilia<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span> and the pea the leaf is long,<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span> in the kidney-beanveined, and in sesame<span id="ref_31"><a href="#note_31">[31]</a></span> and irio the colour of blood. Thelupine and the poppy are the only ones among these plants thatlose<span id="ref_32"><a href="#note_32">[32]</a></span> their leaves.</p><p>The leguminous plants remain a longer time in flower, thefitch and the chick-pea more particularly; but the bean is inblossom the longest of them all, for the flower remains on itforty days; not, indeed, that each stalk retains its blossomfor all that length of time, but, as the flower goes off inone, it comes on in another. In the bean, too, the crop is notripe all at once, as is the case with corn; for the pods maketheir appearance at different times, at the lowest parts first,the blossom mounting upwards by degrees.</p><p>When the blossom is off in corn, the stalk gradually thickens,and it ripens within forty days at the most. The same is thecase, too, with the bean, but the chick-pea takes a much shortertime to ripen; indeed, it is fit for gathering within forty daysfrom the time that it is sown. Millet, panic, sesame, and all thesummer grains are ripe within forty days after blossomingwith considerable variations, of course, in reference to soil andweather. Thus, in Egypt, we find barley cut at the end ofsix months, and wheat at the end of seven, from the time ofsowing. In Hellas, again, barley is cut in the seventh month,and in Peloponnesus in the eighth; the wheat being got in ata still later period.</p><p>Those grains which grow on a stalk of straw are enclosedin an envelope protected by a prickly beard; while in the beanand the leguminous plants in general they are enclosed in podsupon branches which shoot alternately from either side. Thecereals are the best able to withstand the winter, but the leguminous plants afford the most substantial food. In wheat, the<pb n="4024" />grain has several coats, but in barley,<span id="ref_33"><a href="#note_33">[33]</a></span> more particularly, it isnaked and exposed; the same, too, with arinca,<span id="ref_34"><a href="#note_34">[34]</a></span> but most ofall, the oat. The stem is taller in wheat than it is in barley,but the ear is more bearded<span id="ref_35"><a href="#note_35">[35]</a></span> in the last. Wheat, barley, andwinter-wheat<span id="ref_36"><a href="#note_36">[36]</a></span> aræ threshed out; they are cleaned, too, forsowing just as they are prepared for the mill, there being nonecessity for parching<span id="ref_37"><a href="#note_37">[37]</a></span> them. Spelt, on the other hand, millet,and panic, cannot be cleaned without parching them; hence itis that they are always sown raw and with the chaff on. Speltis preserved in the husk, too, for sowing, and, of course, is notin such case parched by the action of fire.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See c. 59 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Triticum hibernum of Linnæus, similar to the "siligo" mentioned inthe sequel.
