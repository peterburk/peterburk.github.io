<div2 type="chapter" n="20" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 20.—HISTORICAL ANECDOTES CONNECTED WITH THE FIG.</head><p><span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> The mention by Cato of the variety which bears the nameof the African fig, strongly recalls to my mind a remarkablefact connected with it and the country from which it takesits name.</p><p>Burning with a mortal hatred to Carthage, anxious, too, for thesafety of his posterity, and exclaiming at every sitting of thesenate that Carthage must be destroyed, Cato one day broughtwith him into the Senate-house a ripe fig, the produce of thatcountry. Exhibiting it to the assembled senators, "I ask you,"said he, "when, do you suppose, this fruit was plucked from thetree?" All being of opinion that it had been but lately gathered,—Know then," was his reply, "that this fig was plucked atCarthage but the day before yesterday<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>—so near is the enemy<pb n="3310" />to our walls." It was immediately after this occurrence thatthe third Punic war commenced, in which Carthage wasdestroyed, though Cato had breathed his last, the year after thisevent. In this trait which are we the most to admire? was itingenuity<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and foresight on his part, or was it an accident thatwas thus aptly turned to advantage? which, too, is the mostsurprising, the extraordinary quickness of the passage whichmust have been made, or the bold daring of the man? Thething, however, that is the most astonishing of all—indeed, Ican conceive nothing more truly marvellous—is the fact that acity thus mighty, the rival of Rome for the sovereignty of theworld during a period of one hundred and twenty years, owedits fall at last to an illustration drawn from a single fig!</p><p>Thus did this fig effect that which neither Trebia nor Thrasimenus, not Cannæ itself, graced with the entombment of theRoman renown, not the Punic camp entrenched within threemiles of the city, not even the disgrace of seeing Hannibalriding up to the Colline Gate, could suggest the means ofaccomplishing. It was left for a fig, in the hand of Cato, toshow how near was Carthage to the gates of Rome!</p><p>In the Forum even, and in the very midst of the Comitium<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>of Rome, a fig-tree is carefully cultivated, in memory of theconsecration which took place on the occasion of a thunderbolt<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> which once fell on that spot; and still more, as a memorial of the fig-tree which in former days overshadowedRomulus and Remus, the founders of our empire, in the Lupercal Cave. This tree received the name of "ruminalis,"from the circumstance that under it the wolf was found givingthe breast—<hi rend="ital">rumis</hi> it was called in those days—to the twoinfants. A group in bronze was afterwards erected to consecrate the remembrance of this miraculous event, as, throughthe agency of Attus Navius the augur, the tree itself had<pb n="3311" />passed spontaneously from its original locality<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> to the Comitium in the Forum. And not without some direful presage isit that that tree has withered away, though, thanks to thecare of the priesthood, it has been since replaced.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span></p><p>There was another fig-tree also, before the temple of Saturn,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> which was removed on the occasion of a sacrifice madeby the Vestal Virgins, it being found that its roots were gradually undermining the statue of the god Silvanus. Anotherone, accidentally planted there, flourished in the middle of theForum,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> upon the very spot, too, in which, when from a direful presage it had been foreboded that the growing empirewas about to sink to its very foundations, Curtius, at the priceof an inestimable treasure—in other words, by the sacrifice ofsuch unbounded virtue and piety—redeemed his country by aglorious death. By a like accident, too, a vine and an olive-tree have sprung up in the same spot,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> which have ever sincebeen carefully tended by the populace for the agreeable shadewhich they afford. The altar that once stood there was afterwards removed by order of the deified Julius Cæsar, upon theoccasion of the last spectacle of gladiatorial combats<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> whichhe gave in the Forum.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Another war is said to have originated in this fruit.
