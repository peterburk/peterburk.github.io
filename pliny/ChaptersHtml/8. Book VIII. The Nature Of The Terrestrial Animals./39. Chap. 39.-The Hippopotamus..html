It has the cloven hoof of the ox; theback, the mane, and the neighing of the horse; and theturned-up snout, the tail, and the hooked teeth of the wildboar, but not so dangerous.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> The hide is impenetrable, except when it has been soaked with water; and it is used formaking shields and helmets.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> This animal lays waste thestanding corn, and determines beforehand what part it shallravage on the following day; it is said also, that it entersthe field backwards, to prevent any ambush being laid for iton its return.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier remarks, as singular, that the descriptions given by the ancientsof the hippopotamus should have been incorrect, more especially with reference to Herodotus, who had visited Egypt, and who has described someof the animals of that country with considerable accuracy; Ajasson, vol.vi. pp. 444, 445; Lemaire, vol. iii. p. 425. Pliny has copied the description of Herodotus, B. ii. c. 71, almost verbatim, and the same has beendone by Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. ii. c. 7. Even the Latin authors, suchas Diodorus Siculus and Ælian, who might have seen the animal in Rome,continued to transcribe the account of Herodotus.—B.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Herodotus and Aristotle, <hi rend="ital">ubi supra,</hi> assert, that his hide is so hard,that spears and other missiles are formed from it; the statement of Plinyis, however, much more correct.—B.</p></body>
