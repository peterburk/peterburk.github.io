<div2 type="chapter" n="45" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 45.—TEN VERY FORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH HAVE HAPPENED TO THE SAME PERSON.</head><p>Q. Metellus, in the funeral oration which he made in praiseof his father, L. Metellus, who had been pontiff, twice consul,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>dictator, master of the horse, one of the quindecemvirs fordividing the lands,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and the first who had elephants in his triumphal procession,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> the same having been taken in the first<pb n="2192" />Punic war, has left it written to the effect that his father hadattained the ten greatest and best things, in the search afterwhich wise men have spent all their lives. For, as he states,he was anxious to become the first warrior, the best orator,the bravest general, that the most important of all businessshould be entrusted to his charge, that he should enjoy the veryhighest honours, that he should possess consummate wisdom,that he should be regarded as the most distinguished senator,that he should by honourable means acquire a large fortune,that he should leave behind him many children, and that heshould be the most illustrious person in the state. To refutethis assertion, would be tedious and indeed unnecessary, seeingthat it is contradicted more than sufficiently by the singlefact, that Metellus passed his old age, deprived of his sight,which he had lost in a fire, while rescuing the Palladiumfrom the temple of Vesta;<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> a glorious action, no doubt, although the result was unhappy: on which account it is, thatalthough he ought not to be called unfortunate, still he cannotbe called fortunate. The Roman people, however, grantedhim a privilege which no one else had ever obtained since thefoundation of the city, that of being conveyed to the senate-house in a chariot whenever he went to the senate:<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> a greatdistinction, no doubt, but bought at the price of his sight.</p><p>(44.) The son also, of the same Q. Metellus, who has giventhe above account of his father, is considered himself to havebeen one of the rarest instances of human felicity.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> For, in ad-<pb n="2193" />dition to the very considerable honours which he obtained, andthe surname which he acquired from the conquest of Macedonia,he was carried to the funeral pile by his four sons,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> one ofwhom had been prætor, three of them consuls, two had obtained triumphs, and one had been censor; each of whichhonours falls to the lot of a very few only. And yet, in thevery full-blown pride of his dignity, as he was returning fromthe Campus Martius at mid-day, when the Forum and the Capitol are deserted, he was seized by the tribune, Caius AtiniusLabeo,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> surnamed Macerion, whom, during his censorship, hehad ejected from the senate, and was dragged by him to theTarpeian rock, for the purpose of being precipitated there from.The numerous band, however, who called him by the name offather, flew to his assistance, though tardily, and only just, as itwere, at the very last moment, to attend his funeral obsequies, seeing that he could not lawfully offer resistance, or repelforce by force in the sacred case of a tribune;<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> and he was juston the very point of perishing, the victim of his virtues andthe strictness of his censorship, when he was saved by the intervention of another tribune,—only obtained with the greatest difficulty,—and so rescued from the very jaws of death.He afterwards had to subsist on the bounty of others, his property having been consecrated<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> by the very man whom he had<pb n="2194" />degraded; and who, as if that had not satiated his vengeance,still farther wreaked his malice upon him, by throwing arope around his neck,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> and twisting it with such extremeviolence that the blood flowed from out of his ears.<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> Andfor my part, too, I should look upon it as in the number of hismisfortunes, to have been the enemy of the second Africanus;indeed, Macedonicus, in this instance, bears testimony againsthimself; for he said to his sons, "Go, my children, renderthe last duties to Scipio; you will never witness the funeralof a greater citizen than him;" and this speech he made tohis sons, one of whom had already acquired the surname ofBalearicus, and another of Diadematus,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> he himself at the timebearing that of Macedonicus.</p><p>Now, if we take into account the above injury alone, canany one justly pronounce that man happy, whose life was thusendangered by the caprice of an enemy, and that enemy, besides, not an Africanus? What victories over enemies couldpossibly be counterbalanced by such a price as this? Whathonours, what triumphs, did not Fortune cancel, in suffering acensor to be dragged through the middle of the city—indeed,that was his only resource for gaining time<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>—dragged to that<pb n="2195" />Capitol, whither he himself, in his triumph, had forborne todrag in a similar manner even the very captives whom he hadtaken in his conquests? This crime, too, must be looked uponas all the greater, from its having so nearly deprived Macedonicus of the honours of his funeral, so great and so glorious,in which he was borne to the pile by his triumphant children,he himself thus triumphing, as it were, in his very obsequies.Most assuredly, there is no happiness that can be called unalloyed, when the terror of our life has been interrupted byany outrage, and much more by such an outrage as this. Asfor the rest, I really am at a loss whether we ought most tocommend the manners of the age,<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> or to feel an increased degreeof indignation, that, among so many members of the family ofthe Metelli, such wicked audacity as that of C. Atinius remained unpunished.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">His consulships were A.U.C. 502 and 506—B.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hardouin informs us, that a certain number of public officers, whichvaried from three to twenty, were appointed to divide the lands of theconquered people among the Roman colonists. Lemaire, vol. iii.p. 159.—B.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The commentators have endeavoured to prove, and not without somesuccess, that Pliny is not correct in the remark, that the first elephantsbrought to Rome, were those which followed in the triumph of Metellus.He has himself informed us, B. viii. c. 6, that they were introduced byCurius Dentatus, in his triumph over Pyrrhus, some years before that ofMetellus. The same fact is also stated by Florus, B. i. c. 18.—B.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ovid, Fast. B. vi. 1. 436, <hi rend="ital">et seq.,</hi> and Val. Maximus, B. i. c. 4,allude to this circumstance.—B.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This fact has been supposed by Hardouin to be controverted by thestatement of Aulus Gellius, who says, B. iii. c. 18, that all the senators, whohad passed the curule chair, were carried to the curia or senate-house, in achariot. But, as Ajasson correctly observes, Aulus Gellius does not assertthat the senators were carried at the public expense, which was the casewith Metellus.—B.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Val. Maximus, B. vii. c. 1, details the various fortunate circumstanceswhich occurred to Q. Metellus; he makes no mention, however, of the violent attack made upon him by Labeo; indeed, he expressly states, thathis good fortune continued to the last moments of his life.—B.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Val. Maximus, <hi rend="ital">ubi supra,</hi> and Velleius Paterculus, B. i. c. 11, speak ofthe honours obtained by the four sons of Q. Metellus; they are alsoalluded to by Cicero in his 8th Philippic, sec. 4., and his Tusc. Quæst. B. i.c. 35.—B.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Dalechamps remarks, that we find in the ancient historians a similaraccount relative to M. Drusus, who, when tribune of the people, hurriedoff the consul Philippus with such violence to prison, that the blood startedfrom his nostrils: also of P. Sempronius, the tribune of the people, who,had it not been for the opposition offered by his colleague, would havecarried the censor Appius Claudius to prison.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This attack of Labeo on Metellus is mentioned in the Epitome of Livy,B. lix. The tribunes of Rome were styled "sacrosancti," and it was considered a capital crime to offer personal violence to them, under any circumstances. Hardouin remarks, that the tribune who came to the rescueof Metellus must have been a military tribune, who, in virtue of his office,had a right to claim the services of Metellus for the army.—B.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cicero, in his oration "Pro Domo suâ," sec. 47, refers to the consecration of the property of Metellus, as a case analogous to that of his ownhouse, which had been similarly consecrated by Clodius.—B. It seems tohave been the custom, when a person had been capitally condemned, forthe tribune of the people to consecrate his property, with certain formali-ties, to some god or goddess; after which it could not, under ordinarycircumstances, be recovered, whether the sentence was revoked or not.Cicero had been capitally condemned through the instrumentality ofClodius, and obliged to fly from Rome.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It was a common expression among the Romans, for a person, "obtorto collo ad prætorem trahi," "to be dragged to the prætor with hisneck wrenched;" and we meet with it repeatedly in the writings ofPlautus. It would appear that it was customary for the lictors or officersof justice to seize criminals in a peculiar manner, perhaps with a rope, andwith the exercise of great violence, whatever their rank.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">According to the remark of Dalechamps, it appears to have been notunusual with the Roman magistrates, when resistance was offered to theirorder, to seize the party by the throat, as is here stated to have been doneby Labeo.—B.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There has been considerable difficulty in ascertaining the names whichshould be given to the sons of Metellus, as the MSS. differ, and there appears to be no means of coming to any accurate decision, by a reference toother authorities. The essential circumstance, however, is, that two of thesons had obtained the honour of a triumph, and had acquired appropriatesurnames.—B. Metellus Diadematus has been much confounded with hiscousin, Metellus Dalmaticus. Diadematus was so called, from his wearing,for a long time, a bandage round his forehead, in consequence of an ulcer.He was consul B.C. <date value="-117" authname="-117">117</date>.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">By being dragged, and not proceeding willingly, in order to gain timefor succour, and so save himself from being hurled from the Tarpeianrock.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Which allowed the laws to take their course, even against an individualof the first consequence in the state.—B.</p></body>
