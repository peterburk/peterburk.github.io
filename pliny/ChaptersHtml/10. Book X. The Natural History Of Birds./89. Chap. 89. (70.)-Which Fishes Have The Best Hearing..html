(70.)â€”WHICH FISHES HAVE THE BEST HEARING.</head><p>Fishes have neither organs of hearing, nor yet the exteriororifice. And yet, it is quite certain that they do hear; for itis a well-known fact, that in some fish-ponds they are in thehabit of being assembled to be fed by the clapping of thehands. In the fish-ponds, too, that belong to the Emperor, thefish are in the habit of coming, each kind as it bears its name.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>So too, it is said, the mullet, the wolf-fish, the salpa, and thechromis, have a very exquisite sense of hearing, and that it isfor this reason that they frequent shallow water.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Martial alludes to these fish-preserves, and the fish coming uponhearing their name, B. iv. Ep. 30, and B. x. Ep. 30.</p></body>
