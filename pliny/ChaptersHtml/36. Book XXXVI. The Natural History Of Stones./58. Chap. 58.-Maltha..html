Festus describes it as a mixture of pitch and wax; and Palladius,in B. i. c. 17, speaks of it as being composed of tar, grease, and limeboiled; and in c. 35 he describes Maltha caldaria as a mixture of hammoniacum,figs, tow, tar, and melted suet. It was probably a general name forseveral kinds of cement. Heineccius says that it was employed for sealing,but on what authority does not appear. See Beckmann, Hist. Inv.Vol. 1. p. 141. <hi rend="ital">Bohn's Edition.</hi></p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is perhaps the meaning of "duplici lenimento." The reading,however, is doubtful.</p></body>
