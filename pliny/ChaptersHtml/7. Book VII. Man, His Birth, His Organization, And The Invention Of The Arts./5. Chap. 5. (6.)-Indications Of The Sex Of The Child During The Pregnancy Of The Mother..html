<div2 type="chapter" n="5" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 5. (6.)—INDICATIONS OF THE SEX OF THE CHILD DURING THE PREGNANCY OF THE MOTHER. <span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span></head><p>On the tenth day after conception, pains are felt in the head,vertigo, and dimness of the sight; these signs, together withloathing of food and rising of the stomach, indicate the formation of the future human being. If it is a male that is conceived, the colour of the pregnant woman is more healthy,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> andthe birth less painful: the child moves in the womb upon thefortieth day. In the conception of a child of the other sex,all the symptoms are totally different: the mother experiencesan almost insupportable weight, there is a slight swelling ofthe legs and the groin, and the first movement of the child isnot felt until the ninetieth day. But, whatever the sex of thechild, the mother is sensible of the greatest languor at thetime when the hair of the fœtus first begins to grow, and atthe full moon; at which latter time it is that children newlyborn are exposed to the greatest danger. In addition to this,the mode of walking, and indeed everything that can be mentioned, is of consequence in the case of a woman who is pregnant. Thus, for instance, women who have used too muchsalted meat will bring forth children without nails: parturition,too, is more difficult, if they do not hold their breath. It isfatal, too, to yawn during labour;<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and abortion ensues, if thefemale should happen to sneeze just after the sexual congress.(7.) It is a subject for pity, and even for a feeling of shame,when one reflects that the origin of the most vain of all animated beings is thus frail: so much so, indeed, that very oftenthe smell even of a lamp just extinguished is a cause of abortion.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> From such beginnings as these springs the tyrant,<pb n="2142" />from such the murderous dispositions of men. Thou man, whoplacest thy confidence in the strength of thy body, thou, whodost embrace the gifts of Fortune, and look upon thyself, notonly as her fosterling, but even as her own born child, thou,whose mind is ever thirsting for blood,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> thou who, puffed upwith some success or other, dost think thyself a god—by howtrifling a thing might thy life have been cut short! Eventhis very day, something still less even may have the sameeffect, the puncture, for instance, of the tiny sting of the serpent; or even, as befell the poet Anacreon,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> the swallowingof the stone of a raisin, or of a single hair in a draught of milk,by which the prætor and senator, Fabius, was choked, andso met his death. He only, in fact, will be able to form ajust estimate of the value of life, who will always bear inmind the extreme frailty of its tenure.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Most of the statements made in this Chapter appear to be taken fromAristotle's History of Animals; they are, however, either without foundation or much exaggerated, and very incorrect.—B.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This opinion, although without foundation, is supported by the authority of Hippocrates, Aphor. B. v. c. 42.—B.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This singular opinion is referred to by Aulus Gellius, B. iii. c. 16.—B.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ælian, Hist. Anim. B. ix. c. 54, mentions the smell of an extin-guished lamp, as producing abortion in a mare.—B.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Tinctoria mens;" there has been much discussion, whether the textdoes not require correction here; and various conjectural emendations havebeen proposed, but not with much success. If the word "tinctoria" wasemployed by Pliny, it may be regarded as one of those bold, and somewhatmetaphorical expressions, which are not unfrequently found in hiswritings.—B.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Valerius Maximus makes the same statement as to the death ofAnacreon, and says that "having lived to an extreme old age, he wassupporting his decayed strength by chewing raisins, when one grain, moreobstinate than the rest, stuck in his parched throat, and so ended his life."This story has been looked upon by some of the modern scholars as afiction of the poets.</p></body>
