<div2 type="chapter" n="15" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 15.—THE FIRST STATUES PUBLICLY ERECTED BYFOREIGNERS.</head><p>The first statue that was erected at Rome at the expense ofa foreigner was that of C. Ælius, the tribune of the people,who had introduced a law against Sthennius Statilius Lucanus,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> for having twice attacked Thurii: on which accountthe inhabitants of that place presented Ælius with a statueand a golden crown. At a later period, the same peopleerected a statue to Fabricius,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> who had delivered their cityfrom a state of siege. From time to time various nationsthus placed themselves under the protection of the Romans;and all distinctions were thereby so effectually removed, thatstatues of Hannibal even are to be seen in three differentplaces in that city, within the walls of which, he alone of allits enemies, had hurled his spear.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span><pb n="6162" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Valerius Maximus refers to this event, but he names the individualStatius Servilius, B. i. c. 8, § 6.—B.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxxiii. cc. 50, 54.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We have an account of the attack by Hannibal on Rome in thetwenty-sixth Book of Livy, but we have no mention of the particular circumstance here referred to.—B.</p></body>
