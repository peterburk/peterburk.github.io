<div2 type="chapter" n="17" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 17.—LIONS; HOW THEY ARE PRODUCED.</head><p>It is a remarkable fact, that pards,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> panthers, lions, andother animals of this kind, walk with the points of their nailsconcealed in a sheath in the body, lest they should be brokenor blunted; and that, when they run, their hooked claws areturned backwards, and are never extended, except in the act ofseizing their prey.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span></p><p>(16.) The noble appearance of the lion is more especially to beseen in that species which has the neck and shoulders coveredwith a mane, which is always acquired at the proper age bythose produced from a lion; while, on the other hand, thosethat are the offspring of the pard, are always without this distinction. The female also has no mane. The sexual passions ofthese animals are very violent, and render the male quite furious.This is especially the case in Africa, where, in consequenceof the great scarcity of water, the wild beasts assemble ingreat numbers on the banks of a few rivers. This is also thereason why so many curious varieties of animals are produced<pb n="2265" />there, the males and females of various species couplingpromiscuously with each other.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> Hence arose the saying,which was common in Greece even, that "Africa is alwaysproducing something new." The lion recognizes, by thepeculiar odour of the pard, when the lioness has been unfaithful to him, and avenges himself with the greatest fury.Hence it is, that the female, when she has been guilty of alapse, washes herself, or else follows the lion at a considerabledistance. I find that it was a common belief, that the lioness isable to bear young no more than once, because, while deliveringherself, she tears her womb with her claws.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> Aristotle, however, gives a different account; a man of whom I think thatI ought here to make some further mention, seeing that uponthese subjects, I intend, in a great measure, to make him myguide. Alexander the Great, being inflamed with a strongdesire to become acquainted with the natures of animals, entrusted the prosecution of this design to Aristotle, a man whoheld the highest rank in every branch of learning; for whichpurpose he placed under his command some thousands of menin every region of Asia and Greece, and comprising all thosewho followed the business of hunting, fowling, or fishing, orwho had the care of parks, herds of cattle, the breeding of bees,fish-ponds, and aviaries, in order that no creature that wasknown to exist might escape his notice. By means of theinformation which he obtained from these persons, he was enabled to compose some fifty volumes, which are deservedly esteemed, on the subject of animals; of these I purpose to givean epitome, together with other facts with which Aristotlewas unacquainted; and I beg the kind indulgence of my readersin their estimate of this work of mine, as by my aid theyhastily travel through all the works of nature, and throughthe midst of subjects with which that most famous of all kingsso ardently desired to be acquainted.</p><p>Aristotle then informs us, that the lioness, at the first birth,produces five whelps, and one less every succeeding year,<pb n="2266" />until, after having produced one only, she ceases to bear.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>The young ones, when first born, are shapeless and extremelysmall in flesh, being no larger than a weasel; for six monthsthey are scarcely able to walk,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> and until they are two monthsold, they cannot move. Lions, he says, are found in Europe,but only between the rivers Achelous and Nestus; being muchsuperior in strength to those which are produced in Africa orSyria.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The pard of Pliny, as we shall find stated below, is the male of thepanther.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier remarks, that all the feline animals have retractile claws, drawnby an elastic ligament into a sheath, and protruded when required for thepurpose of prehension. The sheath is formed of a duplicature or fold ofthe skin and the subjacent cellular membrane.—B.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">What Pliny states here, is without foundation. He supposes that theleopard is the produce of a pard, or male panther, and the female of thelion; but this is incorrect, the leopard being a distinct species of animal.—B.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Herodotus, B. iii. c. 108, gives the same account, which is refuted byAristotle, Hist. Anim. B. vi. c. 31. Aulus Gellius, B. xiii. c. 7, refers toHerodotus, and the refutation by Aristotle.—B.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The account here given of the lioness generally, Aristotle gives respecting the Syrian lioness only, Hist. Anim. B. vi. c. 31; there is somereason to believe that Aristotle is not correct in what he says. The account given by Ælian, Anim. Nat. B. iv. c. 33, is nearly the same withthat of Pliny.—B.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There is much in this account that is incorrect. It is well ascertainedthat the cubs of the lion are proportionably as large and as perfectly formedas the young of other animals that belong to the same family.—B.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Herodotus, B. vii. c. 126, and Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 28,give a similar account of the district in which lions are found.—B. Littréremarks, that this statement of Pliny is probably formed, as originallysuggested by M. Maury, upon the fact, that the lions of Europe, as welearn from Herodotus, attacked the camels of Xerxes, on his invasion ofEurope.</p></body>
