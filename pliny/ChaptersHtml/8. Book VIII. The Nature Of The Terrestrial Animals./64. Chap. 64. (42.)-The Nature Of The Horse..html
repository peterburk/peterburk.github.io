<div2 type="chapter" n="64" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 64. (42.)—THE NATURE OF THE HORSE.</head><p>King Alexander had also a very remarkable horse;<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> itwas called Bucephalus, either on account of the fierceness ofits aspect, or because it had the figure of a bull's head markedon its shoulder. It is said, that he was struck with its beautywhen he was only a boy, and that it was purchased from the studof Philonicus, the Pharsalian, for thirteen talents.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> When itwas equipped with the royal trappings, it would suffer no oneexcept Alexander to mount it, although at other times it wouldallow any one to do so. A memorable circumstance connectedwith it in battle is recorded of this horse; it is said that whenit was wounded in the attack upon Thebes, it would not allowAlexander to mount any other horse. Many other circumstances, also, of a similar nature, occurred respecting it; so thatwhen it died, the king duly performed its obsequies, and builtaround its tomb a city, which he named after it.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span></p><p>It is said, also, that Cæsar, the Dictator, had a horse, which<pb n="2318" />would allow no one to mount but himself, and that its forefeet were like those of a man; indeed it is thus representedin the statue before the temple of Venus Genetrix.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> The lateEmperor Augustus also erected a tomb to his horse; on whichoccasion Germanicus Cæsar<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> wrote a poem, which still exists.There are at Agrigentum many tombs of horses, in the form ofpyramids.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> Juha informs us, that Semiramis was so greatlyenamoured of a horse, as to have had connection with it.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>The Scythian horsemen make loud boasts of the fame of theircavalry. On one occasion, one of their chiefs having beenslain in single combat, when the conqueror came to take thespoils of the enemy, he was set upon by the horse of his opponent, and trampled on and bitten to death. Another horse,upon the bandage being removed from his eyes, found that hehad covered his mother, upon which he threw himself down aprecipice, and was killed. We learn, also, that for a similarcause, a groom was torn to pieces, in the territory of Reate.<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>For these animals have a knowledge of the ties of consanguinity,and in a stud a mare will attend to its sister of the precedingyear, even more carefully than its mother.</p><p>Their docility, too, is so great, that we find it stated thatthe whole of the cavalry of the Sybarite army were accustomedto perform a kind of dance to the sound of musical instruments.These animals also foresee battles; they lament over theirmasters when they have lost them, and sometimes shed tears<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>of regret for them. When King Nicomedes was slain, hishorse put an end to its life by fasting. Phylarchus relates,<pb n="2319" />that Centaretus,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> the Galatian, after he had slain Antiochusin battle, took possesion of his horse, and mounted it in triumph; upon which the animal, inflamed with indignation,regardless of the rein and become quite ungovernable, threwitself headlong down a precipice, and they both perished together. Philistus relates, that Dionysius having left his horsestuck fast in a morass, the animal, as soon as it disengageditself, followed the steps of its master, with a swarm of bees,which had settled on its mane; and that it was in consequenceof this portent, that Dionysius gained possession of the kingdom.<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Plutarch, in his Life of Alexander, gives some account of this celebrated horse, and Aulus Gellius, B. v. c. 2, devotes a chapter to it.—B.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ajasson estimates the price to have been 70,200 francs, £2925sterling.—B.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Situate on the river Hydaspes; Q.
