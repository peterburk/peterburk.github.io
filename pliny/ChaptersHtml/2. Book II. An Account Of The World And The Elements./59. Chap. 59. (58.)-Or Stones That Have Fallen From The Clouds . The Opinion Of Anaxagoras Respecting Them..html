<div2 type="chapter" n="59" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 59. (58.)—OR STONES THAT HAVE FALLEN FROM THECLOUDS<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>. THE OPINION OF ANAXAGORAS RESPECTINGTHEM.</head><p>The Greeks boast that Anaxagoras<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>, the Clazomenian, inthe second year of the 78th Olympiad, from his knowledgeof what relates to the heavens, had predicted, that at a certain<pb n="1089" />time, a stone would fall from the sun<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>. And the thing accordinglyhappened, in the daytime, in a part of Thrace, atthe river Ægos. The stone is now to be seen, a waggonload in sizeand of a burnt appearance; there was also acomet shining in the night at that time<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>. But to believethat this had been predicted would be to admit that the diviningpowers of Anaxagoras were still more wonderful, andthat our knowledge of the nature of things, and indeed everything else, would be thrown into confusion, were we to suppose either that the sun is itself composed of stone, or thatthere was even a stone in it; yet there can be no doubt thatstones have frequently fallen from the atmosphere. Thereis a stone, a small one indeed, at this time, in the Gymnasium of Abydos, which on this account is held in veneration,and which the same Anaxagoras predicted would fall in themiddle of the earth. There is another at Cassandria, formerlycalled Potidæa<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>, which from this circumstance was built inthat place. I have myself seen one in the country of theVocontii<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>, which had been brought from the fields only ashort time before.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">I have already had occasion to remark, concerning this class ofphænomena, that there is no doubt of their actual occurrence,although theirorigin is still unexplained.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The life of Anaxagoras has been written by Diogenes Laërtius.

It isscarcely necessary to remark, that the authority for this fact mustbe referred entirely to Aristotle, without receiving any additionalweight fromour author. The occurrence of the comet at the same time with theaërolite must have been entirely incidental.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Deductis eo sacri lapidis causa colonis, extructoque oppido, cuinomen a colore adusto lapidis, est inditum, Potidæa.
