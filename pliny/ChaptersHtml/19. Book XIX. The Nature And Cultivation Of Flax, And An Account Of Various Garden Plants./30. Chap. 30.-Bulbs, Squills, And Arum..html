<div2 type="chapter" n="30" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 30.—BULBS, SQUILLS, AND ARUM.</head><p>Next in affinity to these plants are the bulbs,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> which Cato,speaking in high terms of those of Megara,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> recommends mostparticularly for cultivation. Among these bulbs, the squill,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>we find, occupies the very highest rank, although by nature itis medicinal, and is employed for imparting an additional sharpness to vinegar:<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> indeed, there is no bulb known that growsto a larger size than this, or is possessed of a greater degree ofpungency. There are two varieties of it employed in medicine, the male squill, which has white leaves, and the femalesquill, with black<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> ones. There is a third kind also, which isgood to eat, and is known as the Epimenidian<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> squill; the leafis narrower than in the other kinds, and not so rough. Allthe squills have numerous seeds, but they come up much morequickly if propagated from the offsets that grow on the sides.To make them attain a still greater size, the large leaves thatgrow around them are turned down and covered over withearth; by which method all the juices are carried to theheads. Squills grow spontaneously and in vast numbers inthe Baleares and the island of Ebusus, and in the Spanish provinces.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> The philosopher Pythagoras has written a whole volume on the merits of this plant, setting forth its various me-<pb n="4169" />dicinal properties; of which we shall have occasion to speakmore at length in the succeeding Book.<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span></p><p>The other species of bulbs are distinguished by their colour,size, and sweetness; indeed, there are some that are eaten raweven—those found in the Tauric Chersonesus, for instance.Next to these, the bulbs of Africa are held in the highestesteem, and after them those of Apulia. The Greeks havedistinguished the following varieties: the bulbine,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> the seta-nion,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> the opition,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> the cyix,<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> the leucoion,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> the ægilips,<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> andthe sisyrinchion<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>—in the last there is this remarkable feature,that the extremities of the roots increase in winter, but duringthe spring, when the violet appears, they diminish in size andgradually contract, and then it is that the bulb begins to increase in magnitude.Among the varieties of the bulb, too, there is the plantknown in Egypt by the name of "aron."<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> In size it is verynearly as large as the squill, with a leaf like that of lapathum,and a straight stalk a couple of cubits in length, and the thickness of a walking-stick: the root of it is of a milder nature,so much so, indeed, as to admit of being eaten raw.</p><p>Bulbs are taken up before the spring, for if not, they areapt to spoil very quickly. It is a sign that they are ripe whenthe leaves become dry at the lower extremities. When tooold they are held in disesteem; the same, too, with the longand the smaller ones; those, on the other hand, which are redand round are greatly preferred, as also those of the largestsize. In most of them there is a certain degree of pungencyin the upper part, but the middle is sweet. The ancients have<pb n="4170" />stated that bulbs are reproduced from seed only, but in thechampaign country of Præneste they grow spontaneously,and they grow to an unlimited extent in the territory of theRemi.<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Under this general name were included, probably, garlic, scallions,chives, and some kinds of onions; but it is quite impossible to identify theancient "bulbus" more closely than this.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It has been suggested that this was probably the onion, the Alliumcepa of Linnæus.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Scilla maritima of Linnæus, the sea-squill.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xx. c. 39.
