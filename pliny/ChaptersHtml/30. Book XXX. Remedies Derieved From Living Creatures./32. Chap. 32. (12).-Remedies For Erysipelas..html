(12).—REMEDIES FOR ERYSIPELAS.</head><p>For the cure of erysipelas, wool-grease is used, with pomnpholix<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and oil of roses; the blood<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> also extracted from a tick;earth worms, applied in vinegar; or else a cricket crushed between the hands—the good effect of this last being that the person who uses this precaution before the malady has made itsappearance, will be preserved therefrom for a whole year. Caremust be taken also that iron is used for the removal of thecricket, with some of the earth about its hole. Goose-greaseis also employed for this purpose; a viper's head, dried andburnt, and applied with vinegar; or a serpent's slough, appliedto the body, immediately after the bath, with bitumen andlamb suet.<pb n="5457" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxxiv. c. 33.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ajasson remarks that, in reality, this is not blood, but a kind ofviscous liquid.</p></body>
