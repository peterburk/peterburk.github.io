<div2 type="chapter" n="37" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 37.—VARIOUS OTHER KINDS OF PAINTING.</head><p>We must now, however, make some mention of thoseartists who acquired fame by the pencil in an inferior style ofpainting. Among these was Piræicus, inferior to few of thepainters in skill. I am not sure that he did not do injustice to<pb n="6269" />himself by the choice of his subjects,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> seeing that, althoughhe adopted an humble walk, he still attained in that walk thehighest reputation. His subjects were barbers' shops, cobblers'stalls, jackasses, eatables, and the like, and to these he wasindebted for his epithet of "Ithyparographos."<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> His paintings,however, are exquisitely pleasing, and have sold at higherprices than the very largest works of many masters.</p><p>On the other hand again, as Varro tells us, a single pictureby Serapio covered the whole space of the balustrades,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>beneath the Old Shops,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> where it was exhibited. This artistwas very successful in painting stage-scenery, but was unableto depict the human form. Dionysius,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> on the contrary,painted nothing but men, and hence it was that he had thesurname of "Anthropographos."<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> Callicles<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> also paintedsome small pictures, and Calates executed some small works inthe comic style. Both of these styles were adopted byAntiphilus;<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> who painted a very fine Hesione, and a Philipand Alexander with Minerva, now in the School of thePorticos<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> of Octavia. In the Portico of Philippus,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> also,there is a Father Liber<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> by him; an Alexander when a child;and an Hippolytus alarmed at the Bull, which is rushingupon him:<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> and in the Portico of Pompeius<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> we have hisCadmus and Europa. On the other hand, again, he painted a<pb n="6270" />figure in a ridiculous costume, known jocosely as the Gryllus;and hence it is that pictures of this class<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> are generally knownas "Grylli." Antiphilus was a native of Egypt, and receivedinstruction in the art from Ctesidemus.<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span></p><p>It would not be right to pass in silence the painter of theTemple at Ardea,<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> the more particularly as he was honouredwith the citizenship at that place, and with the following inscriptionin verse upon one of the paintings which he executedthere:<lb />"These paintings, worthy of this worthy place,<lb />Temple of Juno, queen, and wife of Jove,<lb />Plautius Marcus,<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> from Alalia, made.<lb />May Ardea now and ever praise him for his skill."</p><p>These lines are written in ancient Latin characters.</p><p>Ludius too, who lived in the time of the late EmperorAugustus, must not be allowed to pass without some notice;for he was the first to introduce the fashion of covering thewalls of our houses with most pleasing landscapes, representingvillas, porticos, ornamental gardening, woods, groves, hills,fishponds, canals,<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> rivers, sea-shores, and anything else onecould desire; varied with figures of persons walking, sailing,or proceeding to their villas, on asses or in carriages. Then.too, there are others to be seen fishing, fowling, or gatheringin the vintage. In some of his decorations there are finevillas to be seen, and roads to them across the marshes, withwomen making<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> bargains to be carried across on men'sshoulders, who move along slipping at every step and totteringbeneath their load; with numberless other subjects of asimilar nature, redolent of mirth and of the most amusing ingenuity.It was this artist, too, who first decorated our uncovered<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span><pb n="6271" />edifices with representations of maritime cities, a subjectwhich produces a most pleasing effect, and at a very triflingexpense.</p><p>But as for fame, that has been reserved solely for the artistswho have painted pictures; a thing that gives us all the morereason to venerate the prudence displayed by the men ofancient times. For with them, it was not the practice todecorate the walls of houses, for the gratification of theowners only; nor did they lavish all their resources upon adwelling which must of necessity always remain a fixture inone spot, and admits of no removal in case of conflagration.Protogenes was content with a cottage in his little garden;Apelles had no paintings on the plaster of his walls; it notbeing the fashion in their day to colour the party-walls ofhouses from top to bottom. With all those artists, art wasever watchful for the benefit of whole cities only, and in thosetimes a painter was regarded as the common property of all.</p><p>Shortly before the time of the late Emperor Augustus,Arellius was in high esteem at Rome; and with fair reason,had he not profaned the art by a disgraceful piece of profanity;for, being always in love with some woman or other, it washis practice, in painting goddesses, to give them the features ofhis mistresses; hence it is, that there were always some figuresof prostitutes to be seen in his pictures. More recently, livedAmulius,<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> a grave and serious personage, but a painter inthe florid style. By this artist there was a Minerva, whichhad the appearance of always looking at the spectators, fromwhatever point it was viewed. He only painted a few hourseach day, and then with the greatest gravity, for he alwayskept the toga on, even when in the midst of his implements.The Golden Palace<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> of Nero was the prison-house of thisartist's productions, and hence it is that there are so few ofthem to be be seen elsewhere.</p><p>Next in repute to him were Cornelius Pinus and AttiusPriscus, who painted the Temple of Honour and that ofVirtue,<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span> on their restoration by the Emperor VespasianusAugustus. Priscus approaches more closely to the ancientmasters.<pb n="6272" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He belonged, as Wornum remarks, to the class of genre-painters.or <hi rend="ital">peintres du genre bas,</hi> as the French term them.
