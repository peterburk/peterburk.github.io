<div2 type="chapter" n="16" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 16. (15.)—FORTY-ONE VARIETIES OF THE PEAR.</head><p>A similar degree of precocity has caused the appellation of"superbum"<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> to be given to one species of the pear: it is asmall fruit, but ripens with remarkable rapidity. All theworld are extremely partial to the Crustumian<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> pear; and nextto it comes the Falernian,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> so called from the drink<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> whichit affords, so abundant is its juice. This juice is known bythe name of "milk" in the variety which, of a black colour,is by some called the pear of Syria.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> The denominationsgiven to the others vary according to the respective localities oftheir growth. Among the pears, the names of which have beenadopted in our city, the Decimian pear, and the Pseudo-Decimian—an offshoot from it—have conferred considerablerenown upon the name of those who introduced them. Thesame is the case, too, with the variety known as the "Dolabellian,"<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> remarkable for the length of its stalk, the Pomponian,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> surnamed the mammosum,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> the Licerian, theSevian, the Turranian, a variety of the Sevian, but distinguished from it by the greater length of the stalk, the Favonian,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> a red pear, rather larger than the superbum,togetherwith the Laterian<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> and the Anician, which come at the endof autumn, and are pleasant for the acidity of their flavour.<pb n="3301" />One variety is known as the "Tiberian,"<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> from its havingbeen a particular favourite with the Emperor Tiberius; it ismore coloured by the sun, and grows to a larger size, otherwiseit would be identical with the Licerian variety.</p><p>The following kinds receive their respective names fromtheir native countries: the Amerinian,<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> the latest pear of all,the Picentine, the Numantine, the Alexandrian, the Numidian, the Greek, a variety of which is the Tarentine, and theSignine,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> by some called "testaceum," from its colour, likeearthenware; a reason which has also given their respectivenames to the "onychine"<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> and the "purple" kinds. Then,again, we have the "myrapium,"<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> the "laureum," and the"nardinum,"<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> so called from the odour they emit; the "hordearium,"<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> from the season at which it comes<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> in; and the"ampullaceum,"<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> so called from its long narrow neck. Those,again, that are known as the "Coriolanian"<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> and the "Brut.tian," owe their names to the places of their origin; added towhich we have the cucurbitinum,<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> and the "acidulum," sonamed from the acidity of its juice. It is quite uncertain forwhat reason their respective names were given to the varietiesknown as the "barbaricum" and the "Venerium,"<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> which lastis known also as the "coloratum;"<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span> the royal pear<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span> too, which<pb n="3302" />has a remarkably short stalk, and will stand on its end, as alsothe patricium, and the voconium,<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span> a green oblong kind. Inaddition to these, Virgil<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span> has made mention of a pear called the"volema,"<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span> a name which he has borrowed from Cato,<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span> whomakes mention also of kinds known as the "sementivum"<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span>and the "musteum."<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "proud" pear.
