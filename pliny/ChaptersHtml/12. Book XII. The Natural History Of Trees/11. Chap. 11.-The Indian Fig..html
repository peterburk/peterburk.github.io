<div2 type="chapter" n="11" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 11.ÑTHE INDIAN FIG.</head><p>The Indian fig<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> bears but a small fruit. Always growingspontaneously, it spreads far and wide with its vast branches,the ends of which bend downwards into the ground to such adegree, that they take fresh root in the course of a year, andthus form a new plantation around the parent stock, traced ina circular form, just as though it had been the work of theornamental gardener. Within the bowers thus formed, theshepherds take up their abode in the summer, the space occupied by them being, at once, overshadowed and protected by<pb n="3110" />the bulwark which the tree thus throws around; a mostgraceful sight, whether we stand beneath and look upwards,or whether we view its arcaded foliage from a distance. Thehigher branches, however, shoot upwards to a very considerable height, and, by their number, form quite a grove, springing aloft from the vast trunk of the parent tree, whichoverspreads, very frequently, a space of sixty paces in extent,while the shade that is thrown by it will cover as much asa couple of stadia. The broad leaves of the tree have just theshape of an Amazonian buckler; and hence it is that thefruit, from being quite covered by the leaves, is greatly impededin its growth. The fruit, indeed, of this tree is but scanty,and never exceeds a bean in size; being ripened, however, bythe rays of the sun, as these penetrate the leaves, the figs areremarkable for their singular lusciousness, and are quite worthyof the marvellous tree by which they are produced. Thesefig-trees are found, more particularly, in the vicinity of theriver Acesines.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This account of the Ficus Indica, or religiosa, known to us as thebanian-tree, is borrowed entirely from Theophrastus.
