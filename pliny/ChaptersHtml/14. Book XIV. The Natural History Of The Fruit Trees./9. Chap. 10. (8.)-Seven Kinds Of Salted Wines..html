(8.)ÑSEVEN KINDS OF SALTED WINES.</head><p>Thus far we have treated of wines, the goodness of which isdue to the country of their growth. In Greece the wine thatis known by the name of "bion," and which is administeredfor its curative qualities in several maladies (as we shall haveoccasion to remark when we come to speak on the subject ofMedicine<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>), has been justly held in the very highest esteem.This wine is made in the following manner: the grapes areplucked before they are quite ripe, and then dried in a hotsun: for three days they are turned three times a day, and onthe fourth day they are pressed, after which the juice is putin casks,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and left to acquire age in the heat of the sun.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span></p><p>The people of Cos mix sea-water in large quantities withtheir wines, an invention which they first learned from a slave,who adopted this method of supplying the deficiency that hadbeen caused by his thievish propensities. When this is mixedwith white must, the mixture receives the name of "leu-<pb n="3248" />cocoum."<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> In other countries again, they follow a similarplan in making a wine called "tethalassomenon."<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> Theymake a wine also known as "thalassites,"<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> by placing vesselsfull of must in the sea, a method which quickly imparts to thewine all the qualities of old age.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> In our own country too,Cato has shown the method of making Italian wine into Coan:in addition to the modes of preparation above stated, he tells usthat it must be left exposed four years to the heat of the sun,in order to bring it to maturity. The Rhodian<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> wine issimilar to that of Cos, and the Phorinean is of a still salterflavour. It is generally thought that all the wines frombeyond sea arrive at their middle state of maturity in thecourse of six<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> or seven years.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">B. xxiii. c. 1, and c. 26.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Cadis."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">FŽe remarks that this method is still adopted in making several ofthe liqueurs.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">White wine of Cos.
