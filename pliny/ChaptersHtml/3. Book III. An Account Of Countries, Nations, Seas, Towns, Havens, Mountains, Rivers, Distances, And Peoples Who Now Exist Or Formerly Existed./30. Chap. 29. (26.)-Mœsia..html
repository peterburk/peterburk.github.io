(26.)ÑMÎSIA.</head><p>Joining up to Pannonia is the province called MÏsia<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>, whichruns, with the course of the Danube, as far as the Euxine.It commences at the confluence<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> previously mentioned. In itare the Dardani, the Celegeri, the Triballi, the Timachi, theMÏsi, the Thracians, and the Scythians who border on the Euxine.The more famous among its rivers are theMargis<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>, whichrises in the territory of the Dardani, the Pingus, the Timachus, theÎscus which rises in Mount Rhodope, and,risingin Mount H¾mus, the Utus<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, the Asamus, and the Ieterus.<pb n="1265" /></p><p>The breadth of Illyricum<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> at its widest part is 325 miles,and its length from the river Arsia to the river Drinius530; from the Drinius to the Promontory of AcrocerauniaAgrippa states to be 175 miles, and he says that the entirecircuit of the Italian and Illyrian Gulf is 1700 miles. Inthis Gulf, according to the limits which we have drawn,are two seas, the Ionian<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> in the first part, and the Adriatic,which runs more inland and is called the Upper Sea.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Corresponding to the present Servia and Bulgaria.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Of the Danube with the Saave or Savus just mentioned.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now the Morava, which runs through Servia into the Danube.The Pingus is probably the Bek, which joins the Danube near Gradistic.The Timachus is the modern Timoch, and the Îscus is the Iscar inBulgaria.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called the Vid, the Osma, and the Jantra, rising in theBalkan chain.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ajasson remarks here that the name of Illyricum was very vaguelyused by the ancients, and that at different periods, different countrieswere so designated. In Pliny's time that region comprised the countrybetween the Arsia and the mouth of the Drilo, bounding it on the sideof Macedonia. It would thus comprehend a part of modern Carniola,with part of Croatia, Bosnia, Dahnatia, and Upper Albania. In latertimes this name was extended to Noricum, Pannonia, Moesia, Dacia,Macedonia, Thessalia, Achaia, Epirus, and even the Isle of Crete.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Here meaning that part of the Mediterranean which lies betweenItaly and Greece south of the Adriatic. In more ancient times theAdriatic was included in the Ionian Sea, which was probably so calledfrom the Ionian colonies which settled in Cephallenia and the otherislands on the western coast of Greece.</p></body>
