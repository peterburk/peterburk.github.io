It is then put to soak in sea-water, this being thebest of all for the purpose, though fresh water will do in casesea-water cannot be procured: this done, it is again dried inthe sun, and then moistened afresh. If it is wanted for immediate use, it is put in a tub and steeped in warm water, afterwhich it is placed in an upright position to dry: this beinguniversally admitted to be the most expeditious method of preparing it. To make it ready for use, it requires to be beatenout. Articles made of it are proof, more particularly, againstthe action of fresh or sea-water; but on dry land, ropes of hempare generally preferred. Indeed, we find that spartum receivesnutriment even from being under water, by way of compensation, as it were, for the thirst it has had to endure upon itsnative soil.</p><p>By nature it is peculiarly well adapted for repairing, andhowever old the material may be, it unites very well with new.The person, indeed, who is desirous duly to appreciate thismarvellous plant, has only to consider the numerous uses towhich, in all parts of the world, it is applied: from it aremade, the rigging of ships, various appliances of mechanismemployed in building, and numerous other articles which supplythe wants of daily life. To suffice for all these requirements,we find it growing solely on a tract of ground which lies uponthe sea-line of the province of New Carthage, somewhat lessthan thirty miles in breadth by one hundred in length. Theexpense precludes its being transported to any very considera-ble distance.</p></div2></body>
