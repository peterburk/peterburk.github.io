<div2 type="chapter" n="31" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 31.—IONIA.</head><p>Ionia begins at the Gulf of Iasos, and has a long windingcoast with numerous bays. First comes the Gulf of Basilicum<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>, then the Promontory<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and town of Posideum, and theoracle once called the oracle of the Branchidæ<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>, but now ofDidymæan Apollo, a distance of twenty stadia from the seashore. One hundred and eighty stadia thence is Miletus<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>,<pb n="1467" />the capital of Ionia, which formerly had the names of Lelegëis, Pityusa, and Anactoria, the mother of more than ninetycities, founded upon all seas; nor must she be deprived of thehonour of having Cadmus<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> for her citizen, who was the firstto write in prose. The river Mæander, rising from a lake inMount Aulocrene, waters many cities and receives numeroustributary streams. It is so serpentine in its course, that itis often thought to turn back to the very spot from whichit came. It first runs through the district of Apamea, thenthat of Eumenia, and then the plains of Bargyla; afterwhich, with a placid stream it passes through Caria, watering all that territory with a slime of a most fertilizing quality,and then at a distance of ten stadia from Miletus with agentle current enters the sea. We then come to MountLatmus<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>, the towns of Heraclea<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>, also called by the samename as the mountain, Carice, Myus<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>, said to have been firstbuilt by Ionians who came from Athens, Naulochum<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>, andPriene<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>. Upon that part of the coast which bears the nameof Trogilia<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> is the river Gessus. This district is held sacredby all the Ionians, and thence receives the name of Panionia.Near to it was formerly the town of Phygela, built by<pb n="1468" />fugitives, as its name implies<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>, and that of Marathesium<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>.Above these places is Magnesia<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>, distinguished by the surname of the "Mæandrian," and sprung from Magnesia in Thessaly: it is distant from Ephesus fifteen miles, and three morefrom Tralles. It formerly had the names of Thessaloche andAndrolitia, and, lying on the sea-shore, it has withdrawn fromthe sea the islands known as the Derasidæ<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> and joined themto the mainland. In the interior also is Thyatira<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span>, washedby the Lycus; for some time it was also called Pelopia andEuhippia<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span>.</p><p>Upon the coast again is Mantium, and Ephesus<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span>, whichwas founded by the Amazons<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span>, and formerly called by somany names: Alopes at the time of the Trojan war, after thatOrtygia and Morges, and then Smyrna, with the surname ofTrachia, as also Samornion and Ptelea. This city is builton Mount Pion, and is washed by the Caÿster<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span>, a river whichrises in the Cilbian range and brings down the waters ofmany streams<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span>, as also of Lake Pegasæus<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span>, which receives<pb n="1469" />those discharged by the river Phyrites<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span>. From these streamsthere accumulates a large quantity of slime, which vastlyincreases the soil, and has added to the mainland the islandof Syrie<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span>, which now lies in the midst of its plains. In thiscity is the fountain of Calippia<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span> and the temple of Diana,which last is surrounded by two streams, each known by thename of Selenus, and flowing from opposite directions.</p><p>After leaving Ephesus there is another Mantium, belongingto the Colophonians, and in the interior Colophon<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span> itself,past which the river Halesus<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span> flows. After this we come tothe temple<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span> of the Clarian Apollo, and Lebedos<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span>: the cityof Notium<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span> once stood here. Next comes the Promontoryof Coryceium<span id="ref_31"><a href="#note_31">[31]</a></span>, and then Mount Mimas, which projects 150miles into the sea, and as it approaches the mainland sinksdown into extensive plains. It was at this place that Alexanderthe Great gave orders for the plain to be cut through, adistance of seven miles and a half, for the purpose of joiningthe two gulfs and making an island of Erythræ<span id="ref_32"><a href="#note_32">[32]</a></span> and Mimas.<pb n="1470" />Near Erythræ formerly stood the towns of Pteleon, Helos,and Dorion; we now find the river Aleon, Corynæum, aPromontory of Mount Mimas, Clazomenæ<span id="ref_33"><a href="#note_33">[33]</a></span>, Parthenie<span id="ref_34"><a href="#note_34">[34]</a></span>, andHippi<span id="ref_35"><a href="#note_35">[35]</a></span>, known by the name of Chytrophoria, when itformed a group of islands; these were united to the continentby the same Alexander, by means of a causeway<span id="ref_36"><a href="#note_36">[36]</a></span> twostadia in length. In the interior, the cities of Daphnus,Hermesia, and Sipylum<span id="ref_37"><a href="#note_37">[37]</a></span>, formerly called Tantalis, and thecapital of Mæonia, where Lake Sale now stands, are nowno longer in existence: Archæopolis too, which succeededSipylum, has perished, and in their turns Colpe and Libade,which succeeded it.</p><p>On returning thence<span id="ref_38"><a href="#note_38">[38]</a></span> towards the coast, at a distance oftwelve miles we find Smyrna<span id="ref_39"><a href="#note_39">[39]</a></span>, originally founded by anAmazon [of that name], and rebuilt by Alexander; it is refreshedby the river Meles, which rises not far off. Throughthis district run what may almost be called the most famousmountains of Asia, Mastusia in the rear of Smyrna, andTermetis<span id="ref_40"><a href="#note_40">[40]</a></span>, joining the foot of Olympus. Termetis is joined<pb n="1471" />by Draco, Draco running into Tmolus, Tmolus into Cadmus<span id="ref_41"><a href="#note_41">[41]</a></span>,and Cadmus into Taurus. Leaving Smyrna, the river Hermusforms a tract of plains, and gives them its own name. Itrises near Dorylæum<span id="ref_42"><a href="#note_42">[42]</a></span>, a city of Phrygia, and in its coursereceives several rivers, among them the one called the Phryx,which divides Caria from the nation to which it givesname; also the Hyllus<span id="ref_43"><a href="#note_43">[43]</a></span> and the Cryos, themselves swollenby the rivers of Phrygia, Mysia, and Lydia. At the mouthof the Hermus formerly stood the town of Temnos<span id="ref_44"><a href="#note_44">[44]</a></span>: wenow see at the extremity of the gulf<span id="ref_45"><a href="#note_45">[45]</a></span> the rocks calledMyrmeces<span id="ref_46"><a href="#note_46">[46]</a></span>, the town of Leuce<span id="ref_47"><a href="#note_47">[47]</a></span> on a promontory whichwas once an island, and Phocæa<span id="ref_48"><a href="#note_48">[48]</a></span>, the frontier town ofIonia.</p><p>A great part also of Æolia, of which we shall have presentlyto speak, has recourse to the jurisdiction of Smyrna;as well as the Macedones, surnamed Hyrcani<span id="ref_49"><a href="#note_49">[49]</a></span>, and the Magnetes<span id="ref_50"><a href="#note_50">[50]</a></span>from Sipylus. But to Ephesus, that other great luminaryof Asia, resort the more distant peoples known as the<pb n="1472" />Cæsarienses<span id="ref_51"><a href="#note_51">[51]</a></span>, the Metropolitæ<span id="ref_52"><a href="#note_52">[52]</a></span>, the Cilbiani<span id="ref_53"><a href="#note_53">[53]</a></span>, both theLower and Upper, the Mysomacedones<span id="ref_54"><a href="#note_54">[54]</a></span>, the Mastaurenses<span id="ref_55"><a href="#note_55">[55]</a></span>,the Briulitæ<span id="ref_56"><a href="#note_56">[56]</a></span>, the Hypæpeni<span id="ref_57"><a href="#note_57">[57]</a></span>, and the Dioshïeritæ<span id="ref_58"><a href="#note_58">[58]</a></span>.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called the Gulf of Melasso.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now the Cape of Melasso.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The remains of the Temple of Didymæan Apollo at Branchidæ are still visible to those sailing along the coast. It was in the Milesian territory, and above the harbour Panormus. The name of the site was probably Didyma or Didymi, but the place was also called Branchidæ, from that being the name of a body of priests who had the care of the temple. We learn from Herodotus that Crœsus, king of Lydia, consulted this oracle, and made rich presents to the temple. The temple, of which only two columns are left, was of white marble.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The ruins of this important city are difficult to discover on account of the great changes made on the coast by the river Meander. They are usually supposed to be those at the poor village of Palatia on the south bank of the Mendereh; but Forbiger has shown that these are more probably the remains of Myus, and that those of Miletus are buried in a lake formed by the Mendereh at the foot of Mount Latmus.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. vii. c. 57. Josephus says that he lived very shortly before the Persian invasion of Greece.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called the Monte di Palatia.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Generally called "Heraclea upon Latmus," from its situation at the western foot of Mount Latmus. Ruins of this town still exist at the foot of that mountain on the borders of Lake Baffi.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Its ruins are now to be seen at Palatia. It was the smallest city of the Ionian Confederacy, and' was situate at the mouth of the Mæander, thirty stadia from its mouth.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Mannert says that its ruins are to be seen at a spot called by the Turks Sarasun-Kalesi.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">One of the twelve Ionian cities, situate at the foot of Mount Mycale. It stood originally on the shore, but the change in the coast by the alluvial deposits of the Mæander left it some distance from the land. It was celebrated as being the birth-place of the philosopher Bias. Its ruins are to be seen at the spot called Samsun.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called Cape Santa Maria, or Samsun.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He implies that it is derived from <foreign lang="greek">fulh\</foreign> "C flight."</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Between Ephesus and Neapolis. It belonged to the Samians who exchanged with the Ephesians for Neapolis, which lay nearer to their island. The modern Scala Nova occupies the site of one of them, it is uncertain which.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Its ruins are to be seen at the modern Inek-Bazar. It was situate on the river Lethæus, a tributary of the Mæander. It was famous for its temple of Artemis Leucophryene, the ruins of which still exist.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. ii. c. 91.</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now known as Ak-Hissar or the "White Castle." Strabo informs us that it was founded by Seleucus Nicator.</p><p><span id="note_17"><a href="#ref_17">17. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From the excellence of its horses.</p><p><span id="note_18"><a href="#ref_18">18. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Its ruins are to be seen near the modern Ayazaluk. It was the chief of the twelve Ionian cities on the coast of Asia Minor, and devoted to the worship of Artemis, whose temple here was deemed one of the wonders of the world. Nothing, except some traces of its foundations, is now to be seen of this stupendous building.</p><p><span id="note_19"><a href="#ref_19">19. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It was more generally said to have been founded by the Carians and the Leleges.</p><p><span id="note_20"><a href="#ref_20">20. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called the Kara-Su, or Black River, or Kuchuk-Meinder, or Little Mæander.</p><p><span id="note_21"><a href="#ref_21">21. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It has been observed that though Pliny seems to say that the Caÿster receives many streams, they must have had but a short course, and could only be so many channels by which the rivers descend from the mountain slopes that shut in the contracted basin of the river.</p><p><span id="note_22"><a href="#ref_22">22. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This lake or marsh seems to be the morass situate on the road from Smyrna to Ephesus, into which the Phyrites flows, and out of which it comes a considerable stream.</p><p><span id="note_23"><a href="#ref_23">23. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Phyrites is a small river that is crossed on the road from Ephesus to Smyrna, and joins the Caÿster on the right bank ten or twelve miles above Ayazaluk, near the site of Ephesus.</p><p><span id="note_24"><a href="#ref_24">24. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. ii. c. 91. for further mention of this island.</p><p><span id="note_25"><a href="#ref_25">25. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Said to be derived from the Greek, meaning "The beautiful (stream) from Pion."</p><p><span id="note_26"><a href="#ref_26">26. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">One of the twelve Ionian cities of Asia, founded by Andræmon. Notium was its port. There do not seem to be any remains of either of these places.</p><p><span id="note_27"><a href="#ref_27">27. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Called also the Hales or Ales, and noted for the coolness of its waters.</p><p><span id="note_28"><a href="#ref_28">28. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">At Clarus, near Colophon. When Germanicus was on his way to the East, this oracle foretold to him his speedy death. Chandler is of opinion that he discovered the site of this place at Zillé, where he found a spring of water with marble steps to it, which he considers to have been the sacred fountain. Others again suggest that these ruins may be those of Notium.</p><p><span id="note_29"><a href="#ref_29">29. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Its site was probably near the modern Ekklesia, but no traces of the city itself are to be found.</p><p><span id="note_30"><a href="#ref_30">30. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Implying that in his time Notium was not in existence, whereas in reality Notium superseded Old Colophon, of which it was the port, and was sometimes known as New Colophon.</p><p><span id="note_31"><a href="#ref_31">31. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now known as Cape Curco.</p><p><span id="note_32"><a href="#ref_32">32. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The site of this place is now known as Ritri, on the south side of a small peninsula, which projects into the bay of Erythræ. The ruins are considerable.</p><p><span id="note_33"><a href="#ref_33">33. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">On the south side of the bay of Smyrna. In Strabo's time this city appears to have been removed from Chytrium, its original site. Chandler found traces of the city near Vourla, from which he came to the conclusion that the place was very small and inconsiderable.</p><p><span id="note_34"><a href="#ref_34">34. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">According to Nicander, this was a mountain of the territory of Clazomenæ, almost surrounded by sea.</p><p><span id="note_35"><a href="#ref_35">35. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "the Horses," originally four islands close to the mainland, off Clazomenæ.</p><p><span id="note_36"><a href="#ref_36">36. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This was probably the same causeway that was observed by Chandler in the neighbourhood of Vourla, the site of ancient Clazomenæ.</p><p><span id="note_37"><a href="#ref_37">37. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. ii. c. 91, where he speaks of this place as being swallowed up in the earth.</p><p><span id="note_38"><a href="#ref_38">38. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From Clazomenæ.</p><p><span id="note_39"><a href="#ref_39">39. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called Izmir by the Turks, Smyrna by the western nations of Europe; the only one of the great cities on the western coast of Asia Minor that has survived to the present day. This place stood at the head of the cities that claimed to be the birth-place of Homer; and the poet was worshipped here for a hero or demi-god in a magnificent building called the Homereum. There are but few remains of the ancient city: the modern one is the greatest commercial city of the Levant.</p><p><span id="note_40"><a href="#ref_40">40. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hardouin takes this to be the name of a town, but Ortelius and Pinetus seem to be more correct in thinking it to be the name of a mountain.</p><p><span id="note_41"><a href="#ref_41">41. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It does not appear that all these mountains have been identified. Cadmus is the Baba Dagh of the Turks.</p><p><span id="note_42"><a href="#ref_42">42. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Mentioned in C. 29 of the present Book.</p><p><span id="note_43"><a href="#ref_43">43. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In the time of Strabo this tributary of the Hermus seems to have been known as the Phrygius.</p><p><span id="note_44"><a href="#ref_44">44. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Its site is now called Menemen, according to D'Anville.
