Taken in wine,they are good for the stings of serpents, and in cases of poisoning by fungi. For corns on the feet, they are applied boiled<pb n="4367" />in wine, not being taken off before the end of three days. Adecoction of them with grease or oil, has the effect of makingthe hair grow again upon burns. Taken with honied wine,they carry off corrupt blood by stool; they are good, also, forthe spleen and for hernia, and act as an emmenagogue. Boiledin wine and applied with honey, they are curative of woundsof the sinews. They are good, too, for lichens, leprous sores,and scurf upon the face, and they efface wrinkles of the body.</p><p>The petals of the lily are boiled in vinegar, and applied, incombination with polium,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> to wounds; if it should happen,however, to be a wound of the testes, it is the best plan toapply the other ingredients with henbane and wheat-meal.Lily-seed is applied in cases of erysipelas, and the flowers andleaves are used as a cataplasm for inveterate ulcers. Thejuice which is extracted from the flower is called "honey"<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>by some persons, and "syrium" by others; it is employed asan emollient for the uterus, and is also used for the purpose ofpromoting perspirations, and for bringing suppurations to ahead.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See c. 11 of this book. The bulbs of the lily contain a mucilage,and roasted or boiled the are sometimes employed, Fée says, to bring inflammations to a head. Employed internally, he thinks that they wouldbe of no use whatever, and there is nothing in their composition, he says,which would induce one to think that they might be employed to advan-tage in most of the cases mentioned by Pliny.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "Poley."
