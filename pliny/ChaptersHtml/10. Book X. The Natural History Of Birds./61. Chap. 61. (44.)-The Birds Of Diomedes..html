<div2 type="chapter" n="61" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 61. (44.)ÑTHE BIRDS OF DIOMEDES.</head><p>Nor yet must I pass by the birds<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> of Diomedes in silence.Juba calls these birds "cataract¾," and says that they haveteeth and eyes of a fiery colour, while the rest of the body iswhite: that they always have two chiefs, the one to lead themain body, the other to take charge of the rear; that they excavate holes with their bills, and then cover them with hurdles,which they cover again with the earth that has been thusthrown up; that it is in these places they hatch their young;that each of these holes has two outlets; that one of them lookstowards the east, and that by it they go forth to feed, returning by the one which looks towards the west; and that whenabout to ease themselves, they always take to the wing, and flyagainst the wind. In one spot only throughout the wholeearth are these birds to be seen, in the island, namely, whichwe have mentioned<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> as famous for the tomb and shrine ofDiomedes, lying over against the coast of Apulia: they beara strong resemblance to the coot. When strangers who arebarbarians arrive on that island, they pursue them with loudand clamorous cries, and only show courtesy to Greeks bybirth; seeming thereby, with a wonderful discernment, to payrespect to them as the fellow-countrymen of Diomedes.Every day they fill their throats, and cover their feathers, withwater, and so wash and purify the temple there. From thiscircumstance arises the fable<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> that the companions of Diomedeswere metamorphosed into these birds.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier is inclined to think that the Anas tadorna approaches mostnearly the description given here. From Ovid's description of their hardand pointed bills and claws, it would appear that a petrel (Procellaria), orelse a white heron (Ardea garzetta), is intended; but these birds, he remarks,do not make holes in the earth. Linn¾us has given the name of Diomedea exulans to the albatross, a bird of the Antarctic seas, which cannothave been known to the ancients.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">B. iii. c. 29.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See Ovid's Met.
