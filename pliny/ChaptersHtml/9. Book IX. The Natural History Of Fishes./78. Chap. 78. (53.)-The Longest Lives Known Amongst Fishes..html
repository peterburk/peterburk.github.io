(53.)ÑTHE LONGEST LIVES KNOWN AMONGST FISHES.</head><p>We have lately heard of a remarkable instance of length oflife in fish. Pausilypum<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> is the name of a villa in Campania,not far from Neapolis; here, as we learn from the works ofM. Annsaus Seneca, a fish is known to have died sixty yearsafter it had been placed in the preserves of C¾sar<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> by VediusPollio; while others of the same kind, and its equals in age,were living at the time that he wrote. This mention of fish-preserves reminds me that I ought to mention a few more particulars connected with this subject, before we leave the aquaticanimals.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From the Greek <foreign lang="greek">tausi)lupon,</foreign> "grief-assuaging." This was thename of a splendid villa belonging to Vedius Pollio, and which he bequeathed to Augustus. It was famous for its fish preserves; and it washere probably that Pollio kept his muren¾, previously mentioned by Plinyas being fed on human flesh. The vicinity is still called Monte Posilipo.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"C¾saris piscinis. "This may either mean, preserves which hadtheir name from C¾sar, or preserves which afterwards belonged to C¾sar.The work of Seneca, in which this circumstance was mentioned, is nolonger in existence.</p></body>
