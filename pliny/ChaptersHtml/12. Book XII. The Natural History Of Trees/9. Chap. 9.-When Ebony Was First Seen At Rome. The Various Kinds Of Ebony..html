THE VARIOUSKINDS OF EBONY.</head><p>Pompeius Magnus displayed ebony on the occasion of histriumph over Mithridates. Fabianus declares, that this woodwill give out no flame; it burns, however, with a very agreeable smell. There are two kinds<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> of ebony; the rarest kindis the best, and is produced from a tree that is singularly freefrom knots. The wood is black and shining, and pleasing tothe eye, without any adventitious aid from art. The otherkind of ebony is the produce of a shrub which resembles thecytisus, and is to be found scattered over the whole of India.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Fée remarks, that the words of Pliny do not afford us any means ofjudging precisely what tree it was that he understood by the name of ebony.He borrows his account mainly from Theophrastus.</p></body>
