<div2 type="chapter" n="6" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 6. (3.)—TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY-SIX OBSERVATIONSON REMEDIES DERIVED FROM MAN. EIGHT REMEDIES DERIVED,FROM CHILDREN.</head><p>We have already,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> when speaking of the singular peculiarities of various nations, made mention of certain men of amonstrous nature, whose gaze is endowed with powers offascination; and we have also described properties belonging tonumerous animals, which it would be superfluous here to repeat.In some men, the whole of the body is endowed with remarkable properties, as in those families, for instance, which are aterror to serpents; it being in their power to cure personswhen stung, either by the touch or by a slight suction of thewound. To this class belong the Psylli, the Marsi, and the people<pb n="5287" />called "Ophiogenes,"<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> in the Isle of Cyprus. One Euagon,a member of this family, while attending upon a deputation atRome, was thrown by way of experiment, by order of the consuls, into a large vessel<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> filled with serpents; upon which,to the astonishment of all, they licked his body all over withtheir tongues. One peculiarity of this family—if indeed it isstill in existence—is the strong offensive smell which proceedsfrom their body in the spring; their sweat, too, no less thantheir spittle, was possessed of remedial virtues. The peoplewho are born at Tentyris, an island in the river Nilus, areso formidable<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> to the crocodiles there, that their voice even issufficient to put them to flight. The presence even, it is wellknown, of all these different races, will suffice for the cure ofinjuries inflicted by the animals to which they respectivelyhave an antipathy; just in the same way that wounds areirritated by the approach of persons who have been stung bya serpent at some former time, or bitten by a dog. Suchpersons, too, by their presence, will cause the eggs upon whicha hen is sitting to be addled, and will make pregnant cattlecast their young and miscarry; for, in fact, so much ofthe venom remains in their body, that, from being poisonedthemselves, they become poisonous to other creatures. Theproper remedy in such case is first to make them wash theirhands, and then to sprinkle with the water the patient who isunder medical treatment. When, again, persons have beenonce stung by a scorpion they will never afterwards be attackedby hornets, wasps, or bees: a fact at which a person will bethe less surprised when he learns that a garment which hasbeen worn at a funeral will never be touched by moths;<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> thatit is hardly possible to draw serpents from their holes exceptby using the left hand; and that, of the discoveries made byPythagoras, one of the most unerring, is the fact, that in thename given to infants, an odd number of vowels is portentousof lameness, loss of eyesight, or similar accidents, on<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> the right<pb n="5288" />side of the body, and an even number of vowels of the likeinfirmities on the left.</p><p>(4.) It is said, that if a person takes a stone or other missilewhich has slain three living creatures, a man, a boar, and abear, at three blows, and throws it over the roof of a housein which there is a pregnant woman, her delivery, howeverdifficult, will be instantly accelerated thereby. In such a case,too, a successful result will be rendered all the more probable,it a light infantry lance<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> is used, which has been drawn froma man's body without touching the earth; indeed, if it isbrought into the house it will be productive of a similar result.In the same way, too, we find it stated in the writings ofOrpheus and Archelaiis, that arrows, drawn from a humanbody without being allowed to touch the ground, and placedbeneath the bed, will have all the effect of a philtre; and,what is even more than this, that it is a cure for epilepsy ifthe patient eats the flesh of it wild beast killed with an ironweapon with which a human being has been slain.</p><p>Some individuals, too, are possessed of medicinal propertiesin certain parts of the body; the thumb of King Pyrrhus, forinstance, as already<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> mentioned. At Elis, there used tobe shown one of the ribs<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> of Pelops, which, it was generallyasserted, was made of ivory. At the present day even, thereare many persons, who from religious motives will never clipthe hair growing upon a mole on the face.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. vii. c. 2.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. vii. c. 2, he speaks of these people—"the serpent-born"—asnatives of Parium, a town of the Hellespont.
