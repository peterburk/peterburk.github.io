<div2 type="chapter" n="51" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 51.ÑTHE CHAMELEON.</head><p>Africa is almost the only country that does not produce<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span><pb n="2303" />the stag, but then it produces the chameleon,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> although it ismuch more commonly met with in India. Its figure and sizeare that of a lizard, only that its legs are straight and longer.Its sides unite under its belly, as in fishes, and its spine projects in a similar manner. Its muzzle is not unlike the snoutof a small hog, so far as in so small an animal it can be. Itstail is very long, and becomes smaller towards the end, coilingup in folds like that of the viper. It has hooked claws, anda slow movement like that of the tortoise; its body is roughlike that of the crocodile; its eyes are deep sunk in the orbits,placed very near each other, very large, and of the samecolour as the body. It never closes them, and when theanimal looks round, it does so, not by the motion of the pupil,but of the white of the eye.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> It always holds the head upright and the mouth open, and is the only animal which receives nourishment neither by meat nor drink, nor anythingelse, but from the air alone.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> Towards the end of the dog-days<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>it is fierce, but at other times quite harmless. The natureof its colour, too, is very remarkable, for it is continuallychanging; its eyes, its tail, and its whole body alwaysassuming the colour of whatever object is nearest, with theexception of white and red.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> After death, it becomes of a<pb n="2304" />pale colour. It has a little flesh about the head, the jaws,and the root of the tail, but none whatever on the rest of thebody. It has no blood whatever, except in the heart andabout the eyes, and its entrails are without a spleen.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> Itconceals itself during the winter months, just like the lizard.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This fact is confirmed by Cuvier, who observes, that it is the moreremarkable that Africa should be without stags, as it abounds in gazelles ofall forms and colours. He supposes that those travellers, who affirm that they have seen stags in this country, had really met with gazelles, whichthey mistook for those animals; Ajasson, vol. vi. p. 451; Lemaire, vol.iii. p. 453.ÑB</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier remarks, that Pliny's account of the chameleon appears to betaken from Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. ii c. 11, but that it is less correct.He notices Aristotle's account of the eye, which is more accurately giventhan the account of Pliny; Ajasson, vol. vi. pp. 451, 452; Lemaire, vol. iii.p. 454.ÑB. The chameleon receives its name from the Greek <foreign lang="greek">xamai\ le/wn,</foreign>"the lion on the ground."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xi. c. 55.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">One of those popular errors which have descended from the ancientsto our times; the chameleon feeds on insects, which it seizes by means ofits long flexible tongue; the quantity of food which it requires appears,however, to be small in proportion to its bulk.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Circa caprificos." Some commentators would understand this inreference to the wild fig-tree, and take it to mean that the animal is morefurious when in its vicinity. The conjecture of Hardouin, however, seemsmore reasonable. He takes "caprificos" to mean the same as the "caprificialis dies," mentioned in B. xi. c. 15, as being sacred to Vulcan, andfalling towards the end of the dog-days.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is another of the erroneous opinions respecting the chameleon,which has been very generally adopted. It forms the basis of Merrick's popular poem of the Chameleon. The animal, indeed, assumes variousshades or tints, but the changes depend upon internal or constitutionalcauses, not any external object. ®lian, Anim. Nat. B. ii. c. 14, refers tothe change of colour, but does not allude to its colour having any connection with that of the object with which it comes in contact.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The quantity of muscular fibre and blood in the chameleon is nodoubt small in proportion to the bulk of the animal, although not muchless than in other animals of the same natural order; its spleen is veryminute, as Cuvier says, not larger than the seed of a lentil.ÑB.</p></body>
