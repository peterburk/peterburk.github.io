<div2 type="chapter" n="14" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 14. (17.)—WHY THE SAME STARS HAVE DIFFERENTMOTIONS.</head><p>I must first state the cause, why the star Venus neverrecedes from the sun more than 46 degrees, nor Mercury morethan 23<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>, while they frequently return to the sun within thisdistance<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>. As they are situated below the sun, they haveboth of them their apsides turned in the contrary direction;their orbits are as much below the earth as those of thestars above mentioned are above it, and therefore they cannotrecede any farther, since the curve of their apsides has nogreater longitude<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>. The extreme parts of their apsidestherefore assign the limits to each of them in the samemanner, and compensate, as it were, for the small extent oftheir longitudes, by the great divergence of their latitudes<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>.It may be asked, why do they not always proceed as far asthe 46th and the 23rd degrees respectively? They in realitydo so, but the theory fails us here. For it would appearthat the apsides are themselves moved, as they never passover the sun<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>. When therefore they have arrived at the<pb n="1048" />extremities of their orbits on either side, the stars are thensupposed to have proceeded to their greatest distance; whenthey have been a certain number of degrees within theirorbits, they are then supposed to return more rapidly, sincethe extreme point in each is the same. And on this accountit is that the direction of their motion appears to be changed.For the superior planets are carried along the most quicklyin their evening setting, while these move the most slowly;the former are at their greatest distance from the earthwhen they move the most slowly, the latter when they movethe most quickly. The former are accelerated when nearestto the earth, the latter when at the extremity of the circle;in the former the rapidity of the motion begins todiminish at their morning risings, in the latter it begins toincrease; the former are retrograde from their morning totheir evening station, while Venus is retrograde from theevening to the morning station. She begins to increase herlatitude from her morning rising, her altitude follows thesun from her morning station, her motion being the quickestand her altitude the greatest in her morning setting. Herlatitude decreases and her altitude diminishes from herevening rising, she becomes retrograde, and at the sametime decreases in her altitude from her evening station.</p><p>Again, the star Mercury, in the same way, mounts up inboth directions<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> from his morning rising, and having followedthe sun through a space of 15 degrees, he becomes almost stationary for four days. Presently he diminishes his altitude,and recedes from his evening setting to his morning rising.Mercury and the Moon are the only planets which descendfor the same number of days that they ascend. Venusascends for fifteen days and somewhat more; Saturn andJupiter descend in twice that number of days, and Mars infour times. So great is the variety of nature! The reasonof it is, however, evident; for those planets which are forcedup by the vapour of the sun likewise descend with difficulty.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">According to Ptolemy, these numbers are respectively 47°51? and24°3?; the modern astronomers have ascertained them to be 48°and 29 °.The least elongations of the planets are, according to Ptolemy, 44°7? and18°50?, and according to the observations of the moderns,45°and 16 °;Marcus in Ajasson, ii. 354.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">I have not translated the clause, "quum sint diversæ stellæ," as,according to Hardouin, it is not found "in probatissimis codd.," andappears to have little connexion with the other parts of the sentence;it is omitted by Valpy and Lemaire, but is retained by Poinsinet andAjasson.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">When these inferior planets have arrived at a certain apparentdistance from the sun, they are come to the extent of their orbits, as seenfrom the earth.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Quum ad illam Solis distantiam pervenerunt, ultra procedere nonpossunt, deficiente circuli longitudine, id est, amplitudine."
