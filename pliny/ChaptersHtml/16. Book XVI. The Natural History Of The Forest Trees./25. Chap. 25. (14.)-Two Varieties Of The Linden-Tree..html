<div2 type="chapter" n="25" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 25. (14.)ÑTWO VARIETIES OF THE LINDEN-TREE.</head><p>In the linden-tree the male<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and the female are totally different. In the male the wood is hard and knotty, of a redderhue, and with a stronger smell; the bark, too, is thicker, and,when taken off, has no flexibility. The male bears neitherseed nor blossom as the female does, the trunk of which isthicker, and the wood white and of excellent quality. It is asingular<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> thing, but no animal will touch the fruit of thistree, although the juice of the leaves and the bark is sweet.Between the bark and the wood there are a number of thincoats, formed by the union of numerous fine membranes; ofthese they make those bands<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> which are known to us as "tili¾."The finer membranes are called "philyr¾," and are renderedfamous by the honourable mention that the ancients havemade of them as ribbons for wreaths<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and garlands. The<pb n="3367" />wood of this tree is proof against the attacks of worms:<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> it isof moderate height<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> only, but of very considerable utility.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There is no such distinction in the linden or lime, as the flowers arehermaphroditical. They are merely two varieties: the male of Pliny beingthe Tilia microphylla of Decandolles, and a variety of the Tilia Europ¾aof Linn¾us; and the female being the Tilia platyphyllos, another varietyof the Tilia Europ¾a of Linn¾us.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Not at all singular, FŽe says, the fruit being dry and insipid.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In France these cords are still made, and are used for well-ropes,wheat-sheafs, &amp;c. In the north of France, too, brooms are made of theouter bark, and the same is the case in Westphalia.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxi. c. 4. Ovid, Fasti, B. v. 1. 337, speaks of the revellers atdrunken banquets binding their hair with the philyra.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Teredo." If he means under this name to include the tinea aswell, the assertion is far too general, as this wood is eaten away by insects,though more slowly than the majority of the non-resinous woods. It issometimes perforated quite through by the larva of the byrrhus, our deathwatch.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is incorrect. It attains a very considerable height, and sometimes an enormous size. The trunk is known to grow to as much as fortyor fifty feet in circumference.</p></body>
