<div2 type="chapter" n="63" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 63.—REMEDIES AGAINST CANINE MADNESS. <span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span></head><p>Canine madness is fatal to man during the heat of Sirius,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>and, as we have already said, it proves so in consequence ofthose who are bitten having a deadly horror of water.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> Forthis reason, during the thirty days<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> that this star exerts itsinfluence, we try to prevent the disease by mixing dung from<pb n="2317" />the poultry-yard with the dog's food; or else, if they are already attacked by the disease, by giving them hellebore.</p><p>(41.) We have a single remedy against the bite, which hasbeen but lately discovered, by a kind of oracle, as it were—the root of the wild rose, which is called cynorrhodos,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> or dogrose. Columella informs us, that if, on the fortieth day afterthe birth of the pup, the last bone of the tail is bitten off, thesinew will follow with it; after which, the tail will not grow,and the dog will never become rabid.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> It is mentioned, amongthe other prodigies, and this I take to be one indeed, that adog once spoke;<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> and that when Tarquin was expelled fromthe kingdom, a serpent barked.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">All these remedies are perfectly useless.—B.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny details the noxious effects, conceived to be produced by the influence of Sirius, in B. ii. c. 40, and, among others, its tendency to producecanine madness. In B. xxix. c. 32, he enumerates the various remediesproposed for the disease; these, however, are equally inefficacious withthose mentioned here.—B.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We have an account of this disease in Celsus, B. v. c. 27, andespecially of the peculiar symptom from which it derives its classicaldenomination. It is remarkable that Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 22,speaking of canine madness, says, that it is communicated by the dog to allanimals, <hi rend="ital">except man.—B.</hi> See B. vii. c. 13.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It appears that there was a difference of opinion as to the number ofdays during which the Dog-star continued to exercise its influence.—B.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The history of this supposed discovery is related more at large, B. xxv.c. 2 and 6. The popular name of the plant is still the "dog-rose."—B.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Columella says, that the operation prevents the tail from acquiring"fœdum incrementum," "afoul increase;" and, as many shepherds say,secures the animal from the disease.—B.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is one of the marvellous tales related by Julius Obsequens,c. 103.—B.</p></body>
