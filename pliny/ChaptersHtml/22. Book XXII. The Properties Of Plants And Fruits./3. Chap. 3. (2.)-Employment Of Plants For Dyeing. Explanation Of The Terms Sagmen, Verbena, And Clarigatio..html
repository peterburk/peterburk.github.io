EXPLANATION OF THE TERMS SAGMEN, VERBENA, AND CLARIGATIO.</head><p>We know, too, that from plants are extracted admirablecolours for dyeing; and, not to mention the berries<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> of Galatia,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>Africa, and Lusitania, which furnish the coccus, a dye reserved for the military costume<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> of our generals, the people ofGaul beyond the Alps produce the Tyrian colours, the conchyliated,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and all the other hues, by the agency of plants<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> alone.They have not there to seek the murex at tine bottom of thesea, or to expose themselves to be the prey of the monsters ofthe deep, while tearing it from their jaws, nor have they to gosearching in depths to which no anchor has penetrated—andall this for the purpose of finding the means whereby somemother of a family may appear more charming in the eyes ofher paramour, or the seducer may make himself more captivating to the wife of another man. Standing on dry land, thepeople there gather in their dyes just as we do our crops of<pb n="4391" />corn—though one great fault in them is, that they wash<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> out;were it not for which, luxury would have the means of bedecking itself with far greater magnificence, or, at all events,at the price of far less danger.</p><p>It is not my purpose, however, here to enter further intothese details, nor shall I make the attempt, by substitutingresources attended with fewer risks, to circumscribe luxurywithin the limits of frugality; though, at the same time, Ishall have to speak on another occasion how that vegetableproductions are employed for staining stone and impartingtheir colours to walls.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> Still, however, I should not haveomitted to enlarge upon the art of dyeing, had I found that ithad ever been looked upon as forming one of our liberal<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> arts.Meantime, I shall be actuated by higher considerations, andshall proceed to show in what esteem we are bound to holdthe mute<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> plants even, or in other words, the plants of littlenote. For, indeed, the authors and founders of the Romansway have derived from these very plants even almost boundless results; as it was these same plants, and no others, thatafforded them the "sagmen,"<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> employed in seasons of publiccalamity, and the "verbena" of our sacred rites and embassies.These two names, no doubt, originally signified the same thing,—a green turf torn up from the citadel with the earth attachedto it; and hence, when envoys were dispatched to the enemyfor the purpose of clarigation, or, in other words, with theobject of <hi rend="ital">clearly</hi><span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> demanding restitution of property that hadbeen carried off, one of these officers was always known asthe "verbenarius."<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span><pb n="4392" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Granis."

Itwas commonly white or purple.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">For an account of all these colours see B. ix. cc. 60–65.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The vaccinium for instance.
