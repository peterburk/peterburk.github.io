It isa marvellous feature in this plant, that it takes a delight in beinggathered; indeed, the more it is plucked, the better it grows.It comes into flower in the month of August, and lasts throughout the autumn. The finest of all is the amaranth of Alexandria, which is generally gathered for keeping; for it is areally marvellous<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> fact, that when all the other flowers havegone out, the amaranth, upon being dipped in water, comes tolife again: it is used also for making winter chaplets. Thepeculiar quality of the amaranth is sufficiently indicated byits name, it having been so called from the circumstance thatit never fades.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span><pb n="4328" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Celosia cristata of Linnæus.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Spica."
