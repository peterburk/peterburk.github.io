The same person has left us one instance of magnanimity, to which there is nothing that can be at all compared. While one, who was an admirer of luxury, might perhaps on this occasion have enumerated the spectacles which heexhibited, the treasures which he lavished away, and the magnificence of his public works, I maintain that it was thegreat proof, and an incomparable one, of an elevated mind, forhim to have burnt with the most scrupulous carefulness thepapers of Pompeius, which were taken in his desk at the battleof Pharsalia, and those of Scipio, taken at Thapsus, without somuch as reading them.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Who infested the coasts of Cilicia, and whom he dislodged from theirstrongholds, and almost utterly extirpated.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This fact is mentioned by Seneca, de Ira, B. ii. c. 26.
