<div2 type="chapter" n="12" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 12. (15.)—OF THE MOTIONS OF THE PLANETS ANDTHE GENERAL LAWS OF THEIR ASPECTS<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>.</head><p>The three planets, which, as we have said, are situatedabove the sun<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>, are visible when they come into conjunctionwith him. They rise visibly<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> in the morning, when they arenot more than 11 degrees from the sun<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>; they are afterwardsdirected by the contact of his rays<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>, and when they attainthe trine aspect, at the distance of 120 degrees, they taketheir morning stationary positions<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>, which are termed pri-<pb n="1041" />mary; afterwards, when they are in opposition to the sun, theyrise at the distance of 180 degrees from him. And again advancing on the other side to the 120th degree, they attain theirevening stations, which are termed secondary, until the sunhaving arrived within 12 degrees of them, what is called theirevening setting becomes no longer visible<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>. Mars, as beingnearer to the sun, feels the influence of his rays in the quadrature,at the distance of 90 degrees, whence that motion receivesits name, being termed, from the two risings, respectively thefirst and the second nonagenarian<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>. This planet passes fromone station to another in six months, or is two months in eachsign; the two other planets do not spend more than fourmonths in passing from station to station.</p><p>The two inferior planets are, in like manner, concealed intheir evening conjunction, and, when they have left the sun,they rise in the morning the same number of degrees distantfrom him. After having arrived at their point of greatestelongation<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>, they then follow the sun, and having overtaken<pb n="1042" />him at their morning setting, they become invisible and passbeyond him. They then rise in the evening, at the distanceswhich were mentioned above. After this they return backto the sun and are concealed in their evening setting. Thestar Venus becomes stationary when at its two points ofgreatest elongation, that of the morning and of the evening,according to their respective risings. The stationary pointsof Mercury are so very brief, that they cannot be correctlyobserved.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"luminum canonica."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">They are then said, in astronomical language, to rise heliacally.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In the last chapter this distance was stated to be 7 degrees; see theremarks of Alexandre, in Lemaire, ii. 263.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"radiorum ejus contactu reguntur." The doctrine of the ancientastronomers was, that the motions of the planets are always governed bythe rays of the sun, according to its position, attracting or repelling them.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A planet appears to be stationary, <hi rend="ital">i. e.</hi> to be referred to the samepoint of the zodiac, when it is so situated with respect to the earth, thata straight line passing through the two bodies forms a tangent to thesmaller orbit. The apparent motion of the planets, sometimes direct and atother times retrograde, with their stationary positions, is occasioned by theearth and the planets moving in concentric orbits, with differentvelocities. One hundred and twenty degrees is the mean distance atwhichthe three superior planets become stationary. We have an elaboratedissertation by Marcus, on the unequal velocities of the planets, and ontheir stations and retrogradations, as well according to the system ofAristotle as to that of Copernicus; Ajasson, ii. 316 <hi rend="ital">et seq.</hi> He remarks,and, I conceive, with justice, "...ce n'est pas dans les traités d'astronomiede nos savans que l'on doit puiser les détails destinés àéclaircir le textedes chapitres xii, xiii, xiv et xv du second livre de Pline...Je ne disrien des commentaires de Poinsinet, d'Hardouin et d'autres savans peuversés en matière d'astronomie, qui ont fait dire à Pline les plus grandesabsurdités."</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Occasus planetæ vespertinus dicitur, quo die desinit post occasumsois supra horizontem oculis se præbere manifestum;" Alexandre inLemaire, ii. 265.

I conceive the meaning of the author to be,that while the other planets become stationary, when at 120 degrees from thesun, Mars becomes so at 90 degrees, being detained by the rays, which actupon him more powerfully, in consequence of his being nearer to theirsource.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">I may refer to the remarks of Marcus on the respective distancesfrom the sun at which Venus and Mercury become stationary, and whenthey attain their greatest elongations; Ajasson, ii. 328, 329. Accordingto Ptolemy, Magn. Constr. lib. viii. cap. 7, the evening setting of Venusis at 5°40? from the sun, and that of Mercury at 11°30?.</p></body>
