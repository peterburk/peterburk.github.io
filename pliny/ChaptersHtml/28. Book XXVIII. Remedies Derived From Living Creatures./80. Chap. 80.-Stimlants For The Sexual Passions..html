The right testicle,also, of an ass, is taken in a proportionate quantity of wine, or wornattached to the arm in a bracelet; or else the froth dischargedby that animal after covering, collected in a piece of red clothand enclosed in silver, as Osthanes informs us. Salpe recom-mends the genitals of this animal to be plunged seven times inboiling oil, and the corresponding parts to be well rubbedtherewith. Balcon<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> says that these genitals should be reducedto ashes and taken in drink; or else the urine: that has beenvoided by a bull immediately after covering: lie recommends,also, that the groin should be well rubbed with earth moistenedwith this urine.<pb n="5366" /></p><p>Mouse-dung, on the other hand, applied in the form of aliniment, acts as an antaphrodisiac. The lights of a wild boar orswine, roasted, are an effectual preservative against drunkenness; they must, however, be eaten fasting, and upon thesame day. The lights of a kid, too, are productive of thesame effect.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Georg. iii. 28.
