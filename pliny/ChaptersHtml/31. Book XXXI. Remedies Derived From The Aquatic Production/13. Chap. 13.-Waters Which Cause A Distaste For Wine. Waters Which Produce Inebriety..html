<div2 type="chapter" n="13" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 13.—WATERS WHICH CAUSE A DISTASTE FOR WINE. WATERSWHICH PRODUCE INEBRIETY.</head><p>Eudoxus says that persons who drink the water<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> of LakeClitorius take a distaste for wine, and Theopompus asserts thatthe waters of the springs already<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> named are productive ofinebriety. According to Mucianus,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> there is a fountain at<pb n="5478" />Andros, consecrated to Father Liber, from which wine flowsduring the seven days appointed for the yearly festival of thatgod, the taste of which becomes like that of water the moment it is taken out of sight of the temple.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See Ovid, Met. xv. 322. It sems to be uncertain whether it was atthis lake or the adjoining spring of Lusi above-mentioned, that thedaughters of Prœtus were purified by Melampus.

As Ajasson remarks, Mucianus should have hadthe sense to see that it was only a juggle of the priests of Bacchus. Hecompares it to the miracle of the blood of St. Januarius at Naples. Thecontrivance of the priests of Bel was not very dissimilar; but in theircase, <hi rend="ital">they themselves</hi> were the real recipients of what the god was supposedto devour.</p></body>
