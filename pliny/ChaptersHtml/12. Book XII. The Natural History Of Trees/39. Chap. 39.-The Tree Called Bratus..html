<div2 type="chapter" n="39" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 39.—THE TREE CALLED BRATUS.</head><p>Hence it is, that they import from the country of theElymæi<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> the wood of a tree called bratus,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> which is similar inappearance to a spreading cypress. Its branches are of awhitish colour, and the wood, while burning, emits a pleasantodour; it is highly spoken of by Claudius Cæsar, in hisHistory,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> for its marvellous properties. He states that theParthians sprinkle the leaves of it in their drink, that its smellclosely resembles that of the cedar, and that the smoke of it isefficacious in counteracting the effects of smoke emitted byother wood. This tree grows in the countries that lie beyondthe Pasitigris,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> in the territory of the city of Sittaca, uponMount Zagrus.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. vi. c. 31.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Although the savin shrub, the Juniperus Sabina of Linnæus, bearsthis name in Greek, it is evident, as Fée says, that Pliny does not alludeto it, but to a coniferous tree, as it is that family which produces a resinouswood with a balsamic odour when ignited. Bauhin and others wouldmake the tree meant to be the Thuya occidentalis of Linnæus; but, as Féeobserves, that tree is in reality a native originally of Canada, while theThuya orientalis is a native of Japan. He suggests, however, that theThuya articulata of Mount Atlas may have possibly been the citrus ofPliny.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See end of B. v.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">All these are mentioned in B. vi. c. 31.</p></body>
