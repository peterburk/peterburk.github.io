Pigeons, and otherbirds of a similar nature, shut the two eyelids; but the quadrupeds which are oviparous, such, for instance, as the tortoiseand the crocodile, have only the lower eyelid moveable, andnever wink, in consequence of the hardness of the eye. Theedge of the upper eyelid was by the ancients called " cilium,"from which comes our word "supercilia.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>" If the eyelidhappens to be severed by a wound it will not reunite,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> whichis the case also with some few other parts of the human body.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">" The eyebrows."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is not the fact.</p></body>
