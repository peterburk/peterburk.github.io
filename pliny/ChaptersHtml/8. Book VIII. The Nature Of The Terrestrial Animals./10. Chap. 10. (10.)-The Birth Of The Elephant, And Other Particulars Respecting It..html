<div2 type="chapter" n="10" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 10. (10.)ÑTHE BIRTH OF THE ELEPHANT, AND OTHER PARTICULARS RESPECTING IT.</head><p>The vulgar notion is, that the elephant goes with young tenyears;<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> but, according to Aristotle, it is two years only. Hesays also that the female only bears once, and then a single youngone; that they live two hundred years, and some of them as muchas three hundred. The adult age of the elephant begins at thesixtieth year.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> They are especially fond of water, and wandermuch about streams, and this although they are unable to swim,in consequence of their bulk.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> They are particularly sensitive to cold, and that, indeed, is their greatest enemy. Theyare subject also to flatulency, and to looseness of the bowels, but<pb n="2258" />to no other kind of disease.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> I find it stated, that on makingthem drink oil, any weapons which may happen to stick in theirbody will fall out; while, on the contrary, perspiration makesthem the more readily adhere.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> If they eat earth it is poisonto them, unless indeed they have gradually become accustomedby repeatedly doing so. They also devour stones as well; but thetrunks of trees are their most favourite food. They throw down,with a blow from their forehead, palms of exceeding height,and when lying on the ground, strip them of their fruit. Theyeat with the mouth, but they breathe, drink,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> and smell with[the proboscis], which is not unaptly termed their "hand."They have the greatest aversion to the mouse of all animals,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>and quite loathe their food, as it lies in the manger, if theyperceive that it has been touched by one of those animals.They experience the greatest torture if they happen to swallow,while drinking, a horseleech, an animal which people are beginning, I find, to call almost universally a "blood-sucker."<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>The leech fastens upon the wind-pipe, and produces intolerablepain.</p><p>The skin of the back is extremely hard, that of the belly issofter. They are not covered with any kind of bristles, nor yetdoes the tail even furnish them with any protection from theannoyance of flies; for vast as these animals are, they suffergreatly from them. Their skin is reticulated, and invitesthese insects by the odour it exhales. Accordingly, when aswarm of them has settled on the skin, while extended andsmooth, the elephant suddenly contracts it; and, in this way,<pb n="2259" />the flies are crushed between the folds which are thus closed.This power serves them in place of tail, mane, and hair.<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span></p><p>Their teeth are very highly prized, and from them we obtain the most costly materials for forming the statues of thegods. Luxury has discovered even another recommendation inthis animal, having found a particularly delicate flavour in thecartilaginous part of the trunk, for no other reason, in mybelief, than because it fancies itself to be eating ivory.<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> Tusksof enormous size are constantly to be seen in the temples;but, in the extreme parts of Africa, on the confines of ®thiopia, they are employed as door-posts for houses; and Polybiusinforms us, on the authority of the petty king Gulussa,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> thatthey are also employed as stakes in making fences for the foldsof cattle.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It has been stated, in a Note to chap. 5, that Mr. Corse found theperiod of the gestation of the elephant to be between twenty and twenty-one months.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">®lian, Anim. Nat. B. iv. c. 31, considers the age of sixty to be theprime period of their life, not the commencement of their prime.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This remark is incorrect; when the water is sufficiently deep, it swimswith ease; and if the end of the trunk remains exposed to the atmosphere,it can dive below the surface, or swim with the body immersed.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier remarks, that this statement is incorrect. He dissected threeelephants at Paris, and found that their death had been caused by inflammation of the lungs and chest. The species of elephant, which now inhabitsAsia and Africa, is certainly not adapted to a cold climate; but the numerous remains of elephants found in the north of Asia, prove that aspecies formerly existed, capable of enduring great cold. It is to be observed, that this species was covered with a thick, furry coat of wool andhair.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is from Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 26; but it is scarcelynecessary to remark, that it is without foundation. ®lian, Anim. Nat.B. ii. c. 18, refers to it, and explains it by supposing that the oil was notdrunk, but applied externally; which is less improbable.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">They suck the fluid into the cavity of the trunk, and bend the trunkinto the mouth, where it is received and swallowed in the usual manner.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This dislike is confirmed by Cuvier.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Sanguisuga."</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle, Hist.
