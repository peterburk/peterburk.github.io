IN WHAT TREES THE FRUITSGERMINATE THE ONE BELOW THE OTHER.</head><p>Egypt, too, produces another tree of a peculiar description,the Persian<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> tree, similar in appearance to the pear-tree, butretaining its leaves during the winter. This tree produceswithout intermission, for if the fruit is pulled to-day, freshfruit will make its appearance to-morrow: the time for ripening is while the Etesian<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> winds prevail. The fruit of thistree is more oblong than a pear, but is enclosed in a shell anda rind of a grassy colour, like the almond; but what is foundwithin, instead of being a nut as in the almond, is a plum,differing from the almond<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> in being shorter and quite soft. Thisfruit, although particularly inviting for its luscious sweetness,is productive of no injurious effects. The wood, for its goodness, solidity, and blackness, is in no respect inferior to thatof the lotus: people have been in the habit of making statuesof it. The wood of the tree which we have mentioned asthe "balanus,"<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> although very durable, is not so highly esteemed as this, as it is knotted and twisted in the greaterpart: hence it is only employed for the purposes of shipbuilding.<pb n="3183" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Fée identifies it with the Egyptian almond, mentioned by Pliny inB. xv. c. 28; the Myrobalanus chebulus of Wesling, the BalanitesÆgyptiaca of Delille, and the Xymenia Ægyptiaca of Linnæus. Schreberand Sprengel take it to be the Cordia Sebestana of Linnæus; but that is atree peculiar to the Antilles. The fruit is in shape like a date, enclosing alarge stone with five sides, and covered with a little viscous flesh, of somewhat bitter, though not disagreeable flavour. It is found in the vicinityof Sennaar, and near the Red Sea. The Arabs call it the "date of theDesert."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xviii. c. 68.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xv. c. 34.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or ben.
