<div2 type="chapter" n="53" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 53. (52.)ÑTHE ETRURIAN<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> AND THE ROMANOBSERVATIONS ON THESE POINTS.</head><p>The Tuscan books inform us, that there are nine Godswho discharge thunder-storms, that there are eleven different kindsof them, and that three of them are darted out byJupiter. Of these the Romans retained only two, ascribingthe diurnal kind to Jupiter, and the nocturnal to Summanus<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>; thislatter kind being more rare, in consequence ofthe heavens being colder, as was mentioned above. TheEtrurians also suppose, that those which are named Infernalburst out of the ground; they are produced in the winterand are particularly fierce and direful, as all things are whichproceed from the earth, and are not generated by or proceeding fromthe stars, but from a cause which is near at hand,and of a more disorderly nature. As a proof of this it issaid, that all those which proceed from the higher regionsstrike obliquely, while those which are termed terrestrialstrike in a direct line. And because these fall from matterwhich is nearer to us, they are supposed to proceed from theearth, since they leave no traces of a rebound; this beingthe effect of a stroke coming not from below, but from anopposite quarter. Those who have searched into the subject<pb n="1083" />more minutely suppose, that these come from the planetSaturn, as those that are of a burning nature do from Mars.In this way it was that Volsinium, the most opulent town ofthe Tuscans, was entirely consumed by lightning<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>. Thefirst of these strokes that a man receives, after he has comeinto possession of any property, is termed <hi rend="ital">Familiar</hi><span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, and issupposed to prognosticate the events of the whole of his life.But it is not generally supposed that they predict events ofa private nature for a longer space than ten years, unlessthey happen at the time of a first marriage or a birth-day;nor that public predictions extend beyond thirty years<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>, unless withrespect to the founding of colonies<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Seneca gives us an account of the opinions of the Tuscans; Nat.Qu¾st. ii. 32; and Cicero refers to the "libri fulgurales" of the Etrurians;De Divin. i. 72.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">According to Hardouin, "Summanus est Deus summus Manium,idem Orcus et Pluto dictus."

From the nature of the district in which it is situate, it isperhaps more probable, that the event alluded to in the text was producedby a volcanic eruption, attended by lightning, than by a simple thunderstorm.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Vocant et familiaria.....qu¾ prima fiunt familiam suam cuiqueindepto." This remark is explained by the following passage from Seneca;Nat. Qu¾st. ii. 47. "H¾c sunt fulmina, qu¾ primo accepto patrimonio,in novo hominis aut urbis statu fiunt." This opinion, as well as most ofthose of our author, respecting the auguries to be formed from thunder,is combated by Seneca; <hi rend="ital">ubi supra, ¤</hi> 48.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This opinion is also referred to by Seneca. in the following passage;"privata autem fulmina negant ultra decimum annum, publica ultratrigesimum posse deferri;" <hi rend="ital">ubi supra.</hi></p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"in deductione oppidorum;" according to Hardouin, Lemaire, i. 350,"quum in oppida coloniee deducuntur."</p></body>
