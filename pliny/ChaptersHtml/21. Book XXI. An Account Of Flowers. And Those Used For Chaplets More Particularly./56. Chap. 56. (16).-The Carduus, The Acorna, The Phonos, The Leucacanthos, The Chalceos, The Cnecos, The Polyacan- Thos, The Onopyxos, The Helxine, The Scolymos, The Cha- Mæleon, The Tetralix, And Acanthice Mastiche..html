<div2 type="chapter" n="56" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 56. (16).—THE CARDUUS, THE ACORNA, THE PHONOS, THELEUCACANTHOS, THE CHALCEOS, THE CNECOS, THE POLYACAN-THOS, THE ONOPYXOS, THE HELXINE, THE SCOLYMOS, THE CHA-MÆLEON, THE TETRALIX, AND ACANTHICE MASTICHE.</head><p>The carduus<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> has leaves and a stem covered with a pricklydown; the same is the case, too, with the acorna,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> the leucacanthos,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> the chalceos,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> the cnecos,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> the polyacanthos,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> theonopyxos,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> the helxine,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> and the scolymos;<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> the chamæleon,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>however, has no prickles upon the leaves. There is, however,this difference among these plants, that some of them havenumerous stems and branches, such as the carduus, for instance; while others, again, have a single stem and no branches,the cnecos, for example. Some, again, such as the erynge,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>are prickly at the head only; and some blossom in the summer,the tetralix and the helxine, for instance. The scolymosblossoms late, and remains a considerable period in flower:the acorna being distinguished only for its red colour and itsunctuous juice. The atractylis would be similar in everyrespect to the last, were it not that it is somewhat whiter,and produces a juice the colour of blood, a circumstance towhich it owes the name of "phonos,"<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> given to it by some.<pb n="4354" />The smell of this plant is powerful, and the seed only ripensat a late period, and never before autumn, although the samemay be said of all the prickly plants, in fact. All of themare capable, however, of being reproduced from either seedor root.</p><p>The scolymos, which belongs to the thistle<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> genus, differsfrom the rest of them in the circumstance that the root of itis boiled and eaten. It is a singular fact that this genus ofplants bears blossoms, buds, and fruit the whole of the summerthrough, without any interruption: when the leaf is dried,the prickles lose their pungency. The helxine is a plant butrarely seen, and in some countries only. It throws out leavesat the root, from the middle of which there is a protuberancein the shape of an apple, covered with leaves of its own: thehead of it contains a thick juice, of a sweet flavour, the namegiven to which is "acanthice mastiche."<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He probably means the thistle, but possibly the artichoke, under thisname.
