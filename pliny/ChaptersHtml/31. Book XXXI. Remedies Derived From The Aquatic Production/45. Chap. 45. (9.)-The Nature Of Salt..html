<div2 type="chapter" n="45" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 45. (9.)—THE NATURE OF SALT.</head><p>Salt, regarded by itself, is naturally igneous, and yet itmanifests an antipathy to fire, and flies<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> from it. It consumerseverything, and yet upon living bodies it has an astringent,desiccative, and binding effect, while the dead it preservesfrom putrefaction,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and makes them last for ages even. Inrespect, however, of its medicinal properties, it is of a mordent,burning, detergent, attenuating, and resolvent nature; it is, however, injurious to the stomach, except that it acts as a stimulant<pb n="5510" />to the appetite, For the cure of injuries inflicted by serpents, itis used with origanum, honey, and hyssop; and for the sting ofthe cerastes, with origanum, cedar-resin, pitch, or honey. Takeninternally with vinegar, it is good for injuries caused by thescolopendra; and, applied topically, with an equal proportionof linseed, in oil or vinegar, for stings inflicted by scorpions. Forstings of hornets, wasps, and insects of a similar description,it is applied with vinegar; and, for the cure of hemicrania,ulcers on the head, blisters, pimples, and incipient warts, withveal-suet. It is used also among the remedies for the eyes,and for the removal of fleshy exrescences upon those organs,as also of hangnails<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> upon the fingers or toes. For webs thatform upon the eyes it is peculiarly useful, and hence it is thatit is so commonly employed as an ingredient in eye-salves, aswell as plasters. For all these last-mentioned purposes, thesalt of Tatta or of Caunus is more particularly in request.</p><p>In cases where there is ecchymosis of the eyes, or a bruisefrom the effects of a blow, salt is applied, with an equal quantity of myrrh and honey, or with hyssop in warm water, theeyes being also fomented with salsugo. For this last-mentionedpurpose, the Spanish salt is preferred; and when wanted forthe treatment of cataract, it is ground upon small whet-stones, with milk. For bruises it is particularly useful,wrapped in a linen pledget and renewed from time to time,being first dipped in boiling water. For the cure of runningulcers of the mouth, it is applied with lint; gum-boils are alsorubbed with it; and, broken to pieces and powdered fine, itremoves granulations on the tongue. The teeth, it is said,will never become carious or corroded, if a person every morin-ing puts some salt beneath his tongue, fasting, and leaves itthere till it has melted. Salt effects the cure also of leprosy,boils, lichens, and itch-scabs; for all which purposes it is ap-plied with raisins—the stones being first removed—beef-suet,origanum, and leaven, or else bread. In such cases it is thesalt from Thebaïs that is mostly used; the same salt beingconsidered preferable for the treatment of prurigo, and beinghighly esteemed for affections of the uvula and tonsillary glands,in combination with honey.<pb n="5511" /></p><p>Every kind of salt is useful for the cure of quinzy; but, inaddition to this, it is necessary to make external applicationssimultaneously with oil, vinegar, and tar. Mixed withwine, it is a gentle aperient to the bowels, and, taken in asimilar manner, it acts as an expellent of all kinds of intestinalworms. Placed beneath the tongue, it enables convalescentsto support the heat<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> of the bath. Burnt more than once upona plate at a white heat, and then enclosed in a bag, it alleviatespains in the sinews, about the shoulders and kidneys moreparticularly. Taken internally, and similarly burnt at a whiteheat and applied in bags, it is curative of colic, griping painsin the bowels, and sciatica. Beaten up in wine and honey,with meal, it is a remedy for gout; a malady for the especialbehoof of which the observation should be borne in mind,that there is nothing better for all parts of the body than sunand salt:<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> hence<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> it is that we see the bodies of fishermen ashard as horn—gout, however, is the principal disease for thebenefit of which this maxim should be remembered.</p><p>Salt is useful for the removal of corns upon the feet, and ofchilblains: for the cure of burns also, it is applied with oil, orelse chewed. It acts as a check also upon blisters, and, in casesof erysipelas and serpiginous ulcers, it is applied topically withvinegar or with hyssop. For the cure of carcinoma it isemployed in combination with Taminian<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> grapes; and forphagedænic ulcers it is used parched with barley-meal, alinen pledget steeped in wine being laid upon it. In cases ofjaundice, it is employed as a friction before the fire, with oiland vinegar, till the patient is made to perspire, for the purposeof preventing the itching sensations attendant upon that dis-ease. When persons are exhausted with fatigue, it is usual torub them with salt and oil. Many have treated dropsy withsalt, have used external applications of salt and oil for theburning heats of fever, and have cured chronic coughs by layingsalt upon the patient's tongue. Salt has been used, also, asan injection for sciatica, and has been applied to ulcers of afungous or putrid nature.</p><p>To bites inflicted by the crocodile, salt is applied, the sores<pb n="5512" />being tightly bandaged with linen cloths, first dipped<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> invinegar. It is taken internally, with hydromel, to neutralizethe effects of opium, and is applied topically, with meal andhoney, to sprains and fleshy excrescences. In cases of toothache, it is used as a collutory with vinegar, and is very useful,applied externally, with resin. For all these purposes, however,froth of salt<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> is found to be more agreeable and still moreefficacious. Still, however, every kind of salt is good as aningredient in acopa,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> when warming properties are required:the same, too, in the case of detersive applications, when required for plumping out and giving a smooth surface to theskin. Employed topically, salt is curative of itch-scab in sheepand cattle, for which disease it is given them to lick. It isinjected, also, with the spittle, into the eyes of beasts of burden.Thus much with reference to salt.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He alludes to its decrepitation in flame.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pharnaces caused the body of his father Mithridates to be depositedin brine, in order to trausmit it to Pompey.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He uses the word "pterygia" here, as applied to the whole of thebody—"totius corporis"—in its two distinct senses, a hangnail or excrescence on the fingers, and a web or film on the eyes.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In c. 23, he has said much the same of cold water.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Sale et sole."</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This Passage would come more naturally <hi rend="ital">after</hi> the succeeding one.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxiii. . 13.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Ita ut batuerentur ante."
