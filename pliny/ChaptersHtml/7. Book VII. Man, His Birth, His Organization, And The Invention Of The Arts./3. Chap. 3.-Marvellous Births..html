That three children are sometimes produced at one birth, isa well-known fact; the case, for instance, of the Horatii andthe Curiatii. Where a greater number of children than this isproduced at one birth, it is looked upon as portentous, except,indeed, in Egypt, where the water of the river Nile, which isused for drink, is a promoter of fecundity.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> Very recently,towards the close of the reign of the Emperor Augustus, nowdeified, a certain woman of the lower orders, at Ostia, whosename was Fausta, brought into the world, at one birth, twomale children and two females, a presage, no doubt, of the famine which shortly after took place. We find it stated, also,that in Peloponnesus, a woman was delivered of five<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> children at a birth four successive times, and that the greater partof all these children survived. Trogus informs us, that in<pb n="2136" />Egypt,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> as many as seven children are occasionally produced atone birth.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span></p><p>Individuals are occasionally born, who belong to both sexes;such persons we call by the name of hermaphrodites;<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> theywere formerly called Androgyni, and were looked upon asmonsters,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> but at the present day they are employed for sensualpurposes.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span></p><p>Pompeius Magnus, among the decorations of his theatre,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>erected certain statues of remarkable persons, which had beenexecuted with the greatest care by artists of the very highest<pb n="2137" />reputation. Among others, we here read an inscription to thefollowing effect: "Eutychis,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> of Tralles,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> was borne to thefuneral pile by twenty of her children, having had thirty inall."<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> Also, Alcippe<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> was delivered of an elephant<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>—but thenthat must be looked upon as a prodigy; as in the case, too,where, at the commencement of the Marsian war,<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> a femaleslave was delivered of a serpent.<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> Among these monstrousbirths, also, there are beings produced which unite in one bodythe forms of several creatures. For instance, Claudius Cæsarinforms us, in his writings, that a Hippocentaur was born inThessaly, but died on the same day: and indeed I have seenone myself, which in the reign of that emperor was broughtto him from Egypt, preserved in honey.<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> We have a case,<pb n="2138" />also, of a child at Saguntum, which returned immediately intoits mother's womb, the same year in which that place wasdestroyed by Hannibal.</p><p>(4) The change of females into males is undoubtedly nofable. We find it stated in the Annals, that, in the consulshipof P. Licinius Crassus and C. Cassius Longinus,<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> a girl, whowas living at Casinum<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> with her parents, was changed into aboy; and that, by the command of the Aruspices, he was con-veyed away to a desert island. Licinius Mucianus informs us,that he once saw at Argos a person whose name was then Arescon, though he had been formerly called Arescusa: that this person had been married to a man, but that, shortly after, a beardand marks of virility made their appearance, upon which hetook to himself a wife. He had also seen a boy at Smyrna,<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> towhom the very same thing had happened. I myself saw inAfrica one L. Cossicius, a citizen of Thysdris,<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> who had beenchanged into a man the very day on which he was marriedto a husband.<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> When women are delivered of twins, it rarely<pb n="2139" />happens but that either the mother herself, or one, at least, ofthe twins perishes.<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> If, however, the twins should happen tobe of different sexes, it is less probable that both of them willsurvive. Female children are matured more quickly thanmales,<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span> and become old sooner. Of the two, male childrenmost frequently are known to move in the womb;<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span> they mostlylie on the right side of the body, females on the left.<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Columella, B. viii. c. 8, speaks of the fecundity of the Egyptians, butwithout ascribing any particular cause for it.—B.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Quinos." The old reading was "binos," "two" children onlybut Aristotle, in reference, no doubt, to the same circumstance, says, Hist. Anim. B, vii., "One woman, at four births, gave birth to twenty children.For she brought forth five at a time, and the greater part of them werereared."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It was a very general opinion, that the waters of the Nile possess theproperty of promoting fecundity. Seneca mentions it as an acknowledgedfact, Nat. Quæst. B. iii. c. 25.—B.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There are well-authenticated accounts of four children having beenproduced at one birth; but, beyond this, we have no statements in whichwe can place much confidence. In a note by Dalechamps, we have anexample of the credulity of the authors who have treated on this topic, aswell modern as ancient.—B. In the recent volumes, however, of "Notesand Queries," we find some apparently well-authenticated cases of womenbeing delivered of five children at a birth. Nathaniel Wanley, in his"Wonders of the Little World," also gives some apparently authentic instances of as many as five children being born at a birth: but we must beexcused giving credit to the story, quoted by him, of Matilda or Margaret,Countess of Henneberg, who was said to have been delivered, on the Friday before Palm-Sunday, in <date value="1276" authname="1276">1276</date>, "of 365 children, half sons and halfdaughters, with the exception of one, which was an hermaphrodite, allcomplete and well-fashioned, of the bigness of chickens new hatched,saith Camerarius."</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From Hermaphroditus, the son of Hermes or Mercury, and Aphroditeor Venus. According to the poetic story as told by Ovid, Met. B. iv., hewas united in one body, which bore the characteristics of both sexes, withthe nymph Salmacis.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Two cases of this description are mentioned by Livy, B. xxvii. c. 37,and B. xxxi. c. 12. In this latter passage, Livy enumerates the followingprodigious births; among the Sabines, two children of doubtful sex; atFrusino, a lamb with a sow's head; at Sinuessa, a pig with a humanhead; and among the Lucani, a foal with five feet. He informs us thatthe hermaphrodites were thrown into the sea.—B.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier says, "From time to time we do see persons of this nature;and it is not long ago that such a being was exhibited in Paris, thoughcertainly not of a nature to have been ' in deliciis,' at the present day."</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny gives further particulars of this theatre in B. xxxvi. c. 24. Itwas the first stone theatre erected at Rome, and was built B.C. <date value="-55" authname="-55">55</date>, andcontained 40,000 spectators.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Solinus, the ape of Pliny, absolutely takes the meaning of this passage to be, that Eutychis herself was exhibited on the stage by the ordersof Pompey.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">For Tralles, in Asia Minor, see B. v. c. 29.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier speaks of the wife of a porter at the Jardin du Roi, at Paris,who, to his knowledge, had been the mother of thirty children.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It seems doubtful whether Pliny means that the statue of Alcippe wasalso to be seen in the Theatre of Pompey. Tatianus tells the same storyof one Glaucippe, and it is not improbable that under that name he refersto the same person. He says that a bronze statue of her was made byNiceretus, the Athenian. Hardouin suggests that this is the story alludedto by Livy, B. xxvii., and by Valerius Maximus, B. i. e. 6, in their statement that, among other portents, a boy was born with the head of an ele-phant.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier remarks, that it is not an uncommon circumstance, both inman and in other animals, for an atrophy of the maxillary bones to cause thenose to sink down, and produce some resemblance to the trunk of anelephant. To this circumstance, he refers the tales met with, of women,sows, and dogs having produced elephants; see also Val. Maximus, B. vi.c. 5.—B.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">As to this war, see B. ii. c. 85. The portents observed on this occasion were collected by the historian Sisenna, as we learn from Cicero, DeDivin. B. ii.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We find that this incredible tale is not only told by Julius Obsequens, but, according to Dalechamps, by Cornelius Gemma, a comparatively modern writer.—B.</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier remarks, that, in certain quadrupeds, individuals are occasionally born with the upper jaw preternaturally small, so much so, thatthe lower jaw, by its projection, bears some resemblance to a human chin.He had seen a case of this description at Geneva, in a calf, supposed, evenby persons of information, to be the produce of an unnatural connection ofa cow with a Savoyard shepherd. This subject is treated very philosophically by Lucretius, B. v. c. 876, <hi rend="ital">et seq.</hi> With respect to the supposed Hippocentaur of Thessaly, Cuvier remarks upon the successive additions which the story had gained, in the writings of various authors.Cicero, in various parts of his writings, refers to the account of the Hippocentaur as a fabulous tale; Tusc. Quæst. B. i. e. 27; de Nat. Deor. B. ii. c. 38, and B. ii. c. 2; De Divin. B. ii. c. 21.—B.</p><p><span id="note_17"><a href="#ref_17">17. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Consuls A.U.C. 581.</p><p><span id="note_18"><a href="#ref_18">18. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. iii. c. 9. Hardouin remarks that Aulus Gellius, in copyingfrom this passage, seems to have read the word "Casini," as though itwere C. Asinü, meaning that the boy belonged to one C. Asinius. However, it is pretty clear that the reading adopted is the right one, Plinyhaving been careful to give the various localities at which these wonderfulfacts occurred.</p><p><span id="note_19"><a href="#ref_19">19. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Phlegon tells us that this happened in the first year of Nero, and thatthe name of the youth, while supposed to be a girl, was Philotis.</p><p><span id="note_20"><a href="#ref_20">20. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. v. c. 4, 5.</p><p><span id="note_21"><a href="#ref_21">21. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A case of this description is mentioned by Ambrose Paré. The individual was brought up as a girl, but, in consequence of a sudden muscularexertion, the organs of the male were developed, which had previouslybeen concealed internally. It may be remarked, that a great proportionof the well-authenticated cases of a supposed change of sex have been fromthe female to the male, evidently of the kind mentioned by Paré, wherethe male organs have been concealed in childhood, and become subsequentlydeveloped. Cases, however, have occasionally occurred of the contrarykind, arising probably from the unusual size of the clitoris; there are alsocertain cases, where, from the malformation of the parts, the sex is actuallydoubtful, or where even a certain degree of the two may exist, as hasbeen stated above, in Note 51 to Chapter 2. This paragraph of Pliny isquoted by Aulus Gellius, B. ix. c. 4.—B.</p><p><span id="note_22"><a href="#ref_22">22. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This does not correspond with the fact, as it exists in our time; acircumstance which may probably depend upon our improvement in theobstetrical art. Nor is the opinion, that both twins are less likely to live,if of different sexes, sanctioned by modern experience.—B.</p><p><span id="note_23"><a href="#ref_23">23. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Feminas gigni celerius quam mares;" there has been much discussion among the commentators, both with respect to the meaning of thesewords, and the fact to which they are supposed to refer. Hardouin interprets the phrase, "crescere, perfici, vigere, adolescere;" Cuvier translatesit, "les filles sont portées moins long-temps par leur mere." There is,however, no foundation for this opinion as to a difference in the period ofthe gestation.—B.</p><p><span id="note_24"><a href="#ref_24">24. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There may be some ground for this opinion; it is maintained byAristotle in his Hist.
