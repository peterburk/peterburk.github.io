<div2 type="chapter" n="47" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 47.—THE PERIODS OF THE WINDS<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>.</head><p>The spring opens the seas for the navigators. In the beginning ofthis season the west winds soften, as it were, thewinter sky, the sun having now gained the 25th degree ofAquarius; this is on the sixth day before the Ides of February<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>.This agrees, for the most part, with all the remarks that Ishall subsequently make, only anticipating the period by oneday in the intercalary year, and again, preserving the sameorder in the succeeding lustrum<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>. After the eighth day before theCalends of March<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, Favonius is called by some Chelidonias<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>, fromthe swallows making their appearance. Thewind, which blows for the space of nine days, from the seventy-firstday after the winter solstice<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>, is sometimes called Ornithias, fromthe arrival of the birds<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>. In the contrary direction toFavonius is the wind which we name Subsolanus, and<pb n="1076" />this is connected with the rising of the Vergiliæ, in the 25thdegree of Taurus, six days before the Ides of May<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>, which isthe time when south winds prevail: these are opposite toSeptemtrio. The dog-star rises in the hottest time of thesummer, when the sun is entering the first degree of Leo<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>;this is fifteen days before the Calends of August. The northwinds, which are called Prodromi<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>, precede its rising by abouteight days. But in two days after its rising, the same northwinds, which are named Etesiæ<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>, blow more constantly duringthis period; the vapour from the sun, being increased twofoldby the heat of this star, is supposed to render these windsmore mild; nor are there any which are more regular. Afterthese the south winds become more frequent, until the appearance ofArcturus<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>, which rises eleven days before the autumnalequinox. At this time Corus sets in; Corus is an autumnalwind, and is in the opposite direction to Vulturnus. Afterthis, and generally for forty-four days after the equinox, atthe setting of the Vergiliæ, the winter commences, whichusually happens on the third of the Ides of November<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>. Thisis the period of the winter north wind, which is very unlikethe summer north wind, and which is in the opposite direction toAfricus. For seven days before the winter solstice,and for the same length of time after it, the sea becomescalm, in order that the king-fishers may rear their young;from this circumstance they have obtained the name of thehalcyon days<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>; the rest of the season is winterly<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>. Yet the<pb n="1077" />severity of the storms does not entirely close up the sea.In former times, pirates were compelled, by the fear of death,to rush into death, and to brave the winter ocean; now weare driven to it by avarice<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span>.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We may learn the opinions of the Romans on the subject of thischapter from Columella, xi. 2.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">corresponding to the 8th day of the month.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">...lustro sequenti...; "tribus annis sequentibus."
