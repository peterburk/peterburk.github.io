It is planted by placing the bulb ofthe root, that part which some people call the "eye,"<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> in atrench three quarters of a foot in depth, at intervals of twofeet and a half. A reed-bed will renew itself spontaneouslyafter the old one has been rooted up, a circumstance which ithas been found more beneficial to take advantage of thanmerely to thin them, as was formerly the practice; the rootsbeing in the habit of creeping and becoming interlaced, athing that ends eventually in the destruction of the bed. Theproper time for planting reeds is before the eyes begin to swell,or, in other words, before the calends of March.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> The reedcontinues to increase until the winter solstice but ceases to doso when it begins to grow hard, a sign that it is fit for cutting.It is generally thought, too, that the reed requires to betrenched round as often as the vine.</p><p>The reed also is planted in a horizontal position,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and thencovered with earth to a very great depth; by this method asmany plants spring up as there are eyes. It is propagated, also,by planting out in trenches a foot in depth, care being taken tocover up two of the eyes, while a third knot is left just on alevel with the ground; the head, too, is bent downwards, thatit may not become charged with dew. The reed is usually cutwhen the moon is on the wane.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> When required for thevineyard, it is better dried for a year than used in a greenstate.<pb n="3494" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Arundo donax of Linn¾us.
