(17.)—REMEDIES FOR MELANCHOLY, LETHARGY, ANDPHTHSIS.</head><p>For patients affected with melancholy,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> calves' dung, boiledin wine, is a very useful remedy. Persons are aroused fromlethargy by applying to the nostrils the callosities from anass's legs steeped in vinegar, or the fumes of burnt goats'horns or hair, or by the application of a wild boar's liver: aremedy which is also used for confirmed<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> drowsiness.</p><p>The cure of phthisis is effected by taking a wolf's liverboiled in thin wine; the bacon of a sow that has been fedupon herbs; or the flesh of a she-ass, eaten with the broth:this last mode in particular, being the one that is employed by<pb n="5356" />the people of Achaia. They say too, that the smoke of driedcow-dung—that of the animal when grazing, I mean-is remarkably good for phthisis, inhaled through a reed;<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and wefind it stated that the tips of cows' horns are burnt, and administered with honey, in doses of two spoonfuls, in the formof pills. Goat suet, many persons say, taken in a pottage ofalica,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> or melted fresh with honied wine, in the proportion ofone ounce of suet to one cyathus of wine, is good for coughand phthisis, care being taken to stir the mixture with a sprigof rue. One author of credit assures us that before now, apatient whose recovery has been despaired of; has been restoredto health by taking one cyathus of wild goat<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> suet and anequal quantity of milk. Some writers, too, have stated thatashes of burnt swine's dung are very useful, mixed with raisinwine; as also the lights of a deer, a spitter<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> deer in particular,smoke-dried and beaten up in wine.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Under this name, as Ajasson remarks, the affections now called "hysteria" are included.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Veternum."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Another instance of smoking, though not a very tempting one.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xviii. c. 29.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Rupicapra."</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Subulo."</p></body>
