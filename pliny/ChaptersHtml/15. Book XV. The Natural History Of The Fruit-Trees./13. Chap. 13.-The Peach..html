As tothe wild plum, it is a well-known fact that it will grow anywhere; and I am, therefore, the more surprised that no mention has been made of it by Cato, more particularly as he haspointed out the method of preserving several of the wildfruits as well. As to the peach-tree, it has been only introduced of late years, and with considerable difficulty; so muchso, that it is perfectly barren in the Isle of Rhodes, the firstresting-place<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> that it found after leaving Egypt.</p><p>It is quite untrue that the peach which grows in Persia ispoisonous, and produces dreadful tortures, or that the kingsof that country, from motives of revenge, had it transplantedin Egypt, where, through the nature of the soil, it lost all itsevil properties—for we find that it is of the "persea"<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> thatthe more careful writers have stated all this,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> a totally differenttree, the fruit of which resembles the red myxa, and, indeed,cannot be successfully cultivated anywhere but in the East.The learned have also maintained that it was not introducedfrom Persis into Egypt with the view of inflicting punishment,but say that it was planted at Memphis by Perseus; forwhich reason it was that Alexander gave orders that the victors should be crowned with it in the games which he instituted there in honour of his<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> ancestor: indeed, this tree hasalways leaves and fruit upon it, growing immediately upon theothers. It must be quite evident to every one that all ourplums have been introduced since the time of Cato.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span><pb n="3297" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot"><hi rend="ital">I. e.</hi> Asia Minor.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hospitium.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xiii. c. 17.
