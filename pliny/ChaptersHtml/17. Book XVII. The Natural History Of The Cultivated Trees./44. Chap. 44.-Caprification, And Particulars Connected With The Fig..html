Indeed, these insects are so eager to taketheir flight, that they mostly leave behind them either a legor a part of a wing on their departure. There is anotherspecies of gnat,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> too, that grows in the fig, which in its indolence and malignity strongly resembles the drone of the beehive, and shows itself a deadly enemy to the one that is ofreal utility; it is called centrina, and in killing the othersit meets its own death.</p><p>Moths, too, attack the seeds of the fig: the best plan of gettingrid of them, is to bury a slip of mastich,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> turned upside down, inthe same trench. The fig, too, is rendered extremely productive<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>by soaking red earth in amurca, and laying it, with some manure, upon the roots of the tree, just as it is beginning tothrow out leaves. Among the wild figs, the black ones, andthose which grow in rocky places, are the most esteemed, fromthe fact of the fruit containing the most seed. Caprificationtakes place most advantageously just after rain.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xv. c. 21: the Cynips psenes of Linn.
