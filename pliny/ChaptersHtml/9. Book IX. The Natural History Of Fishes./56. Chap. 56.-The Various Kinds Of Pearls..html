<div2 type="chapter" n="56" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 56.ÑTHE VARIOUS KINDS OF PEARLS.</head><p>There is no doubt that pearls wear with use, and will changetheir colour, if neglected. All their merit consists in theirwhiteness, large size, roundness, polish, and weight; qualitieswhich are not easily to be found united in the same; so muchso, indeed, that no two pearls are ever found perfectly alike;and it was from this circumstance, no doubt, that our Romanluxury first gave them the name of "unio,"<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> or the uniquegem: for a similar name is not given them by the Greeks; nor,indeed, among the barbarians by whom they are found arethey called anything else but "margarit¾."<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> Even in the verywhiteness of the pearl there is a great difference to be observed. Those are of a much clearer water that are found inthe Red Sea,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> while the Indian pearl resembles in tint thescales<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> of the mirror-stone, but exceeds all the others in size.The colour that is most highly prized of all, is that of those<pb n="2435" />which are thence called alum-coloured<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> pearls. Long pearlsalso have their peculiar value; those are called "elenchi,"which are of a long tapering shape, resembling our alabaster<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>boxes in form, and ending in a full bulb.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> Our ladiesquite glory in having these suspended from their fingers, ortwo or three of them dangling from their ears. For the purpose of ministering to these luxurious tastes, there are variousnames and wearisome refinements which have been devised byprofuseness and prodigality; for after inventing these ear-rings,they have given them the name of "crotalia,"<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> or castanetpendants, as though quite delighted even with the rattling ofthe pearls as they knock against each other; and now, at thepresent day, the poorer classes are even affecting them, aspeople are in the habit of saying, that "a pearl worn by awoman in public, is as good as a lictor<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> walking before her."Nay, even more than this, they put them on their feet, andthat, not only on the laces of their sandals, but all over the<pb n="2436" />shoes;<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> it is not enough to wear pearls, but they must treadupon them, and walk with them under foot as well.</p><p>Pearls used formerly to be found in our sea, but more frequently about the Thracian Bosporus;<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> they were of a redcolour, and small,<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> and enclosed in a shell-fish known by thename of "myes." In Acarnania there is a shell-fish called"pina,"<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> which produces pearls; and from this it is quiteevident that it is not one kind of fish only that produces them.Juba states also, that on the shores of Arabia there is a shellfish which resembles a notched comb, and covered all over withhair<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> like a sea-urchin, and that the pearl lies imbedded in itsflesh, in appearance bearing a strong resemblance to a hailstone.<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> No such shell-fish, however, as these are ever brought toRome. Nor yet are anypearls of value found in Acarnania, beingshapeless, rough, and of a marble hue; those are better whichare found in the vicinity of Actium; but still they are small,which is the case also with those found on the coast of Mauritania. Alexander Polyhistor and Sudines<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> are of opinion thatas they grow old their tints gradually fade.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Isidorus and Solinus, however, say that the pearl is so called, becausetwo are never found together. The derivation given by Pliny is, however,the more probable one. From the Latin "unio," comes our word"onion;" which, like the pearl, consists of numerous coats, one laidupon the other.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hence we must conclude that the word "margarita" is not of Greek,but Eastern origin.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">®lian, Hist. Anim. B. xv. c. 8, says, that the Indian pearls, andthose which come from the Red Sea, are the best.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The lamin¾ of the lapis specularis, described by Pliny, B. xxxvi.c. 45.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Exaluminatos." It is clear from this passage that Pliny was acquainted with our alum, as he here clearly implies that the alum knownto him was of a white colour. Beckmann, however, in his History ofInventions, asserts that our alum was <hi rend="ital">certainly</hi> not known to the Greeksand Romans, and that their "alumen" was nothing else but vitriol, thegreen sulphate of iron, and that not in its pure state, but such as formsin mines. Pereira, however, in his Materia Medica, says, that there canbe little doubt that Pliny was acquainted with our alum, but did not distinguish it from sulphate of iron, as he informs us that one kind of alumwas white, and was used for dyeing wool of various colours. It is mentioned more fully in B. xxxv. c. 52, where he speaks of its use in dyeing.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">These alabaster boxes for unguents are mentioned by Pliny inB. xxxvi. c. 12. They were usually pear-shaped; and as they were heldwith difficulty in the hand, on account of their extreme smoothness, theywere called <foreign lang="greek">a)la/bastra,</foreign> from <foreign lang="greek">a\,</foreign> "not," and <foreign lang="greek">labe/sqai,</foreign> "to be held."The reader will recollect the offer made to our Saviour, of the "alabasterbox of ointment of spikenard, very precious." Matt. xxvi. 7. Markxiv. 3.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Seneca, Benef. B. vii. c. 9, speaks of them as hanging in tiers fromthe ears of the Roman matrons, two and two; and he says that they arenot satisfied unless they have two or three patrimonies suspended from eachear.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From their resemblance to "crotala," used by dancers, and similar toour castanets.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">That the pearls as fully bespeak the importance of the wearer, as thelictor does of the magistrate whom he is preceding. The honour of beingescorted by one or two lictors, was usually granted to the wives and othermembers of the imperial family.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Even on the "socculus," or "soccus," a shoe or slipper which did notrequire any "obstragulum," or tie. We find from Seneca, De Ben. B. ii.c. 12, and Pliny, B. xxxvii. c. 6, that Caligula wore gold and pearls uponhis socculi.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">®ian, Hist. Anim. B. xv. c. 8, states to this effect from Juba.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">They are found also, Ajasson says, at the present day, in some of thecoldest rivers and torrents of Auvergne.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "pinna," the Greek name of this kind of pearl oyster.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier remarks, that he is here probably speaking of some spinybivalve, perhaps the Spondylus of Linn¾us.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Grandini." But Hardouin thinks, and probably correctly, that themeaning here of the word is the "measles of swine;" for Androsthenes, inAthen¾us, B. iii., has a similar passage, in which he says: "The stone(<hi rend="ital">i. e.</hi> pearl) grows in the flesh of the shell-fish, just as the measles grow inthe flesh of swine."</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He is also mentioned in B. xxxvi. c. 12, and B. xxxvii. cc. 9, 11, 23,35, and 50, as a writer on gems; but nothing else seems to be known ofhim.</p></body>
