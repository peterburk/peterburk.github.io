Thereis also a sign in the heavens; for, when a shock is near athand, either in the daytime or a little after sunset, a cloudis stretched out in the clear sky, like a long thin line<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>. Thewater in wells is also more turbid than usual, and it emits adisagreeable odour<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This observation is taken from Aristotle, Meteor. ii. 8.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Phænomena of this kind have been frequently noticed, and are notdifficult of explanation.</p></body>
