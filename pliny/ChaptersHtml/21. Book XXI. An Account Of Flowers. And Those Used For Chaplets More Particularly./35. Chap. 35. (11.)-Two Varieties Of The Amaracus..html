<div2 type="chapter" n="35" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 35. (11.)ÑTWO VARIETIES OF THE AMARACUS.</head><p>Diodes, the physician, and the people of Sicily have giventhe name of "amaracus" to the plant known in Egypt andSyria as sampsuchum.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> It is reproduced two ways, from<pb n="4335" />seed and from cuttings, being more long-lived than the preceding plants, and possessed of a more agreeable smell. Theamaracus, like the abrotonum, has a great abundance of seed,but while the abrotonum has a single root, which penetratesdeep into the ground, those of the other plant adhere butlightly to the surface of the earth. Those of the other plantswhich love the shade, water, and manure, are generally setat the beginning of autumn, and even, in some localities, inspring.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xiii. c. 2. The sampsuchum, or amaracus, is generallythought to be the sweet majoram, or Origanum marjorana of Linn¾us.But FŽe identifies it with the Origanum majoranoides of Willdenow, ourorgany, wild or false marjoram.</p></body>
