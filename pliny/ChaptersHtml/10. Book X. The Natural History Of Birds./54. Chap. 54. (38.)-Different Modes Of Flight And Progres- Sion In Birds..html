(38.)â€”DIFFERENT MODES OF FLIGHT AND PROGRES-SION IN BIRDS.</head><p>The flight of the pigeon also leads me to consider that ofother birds as well. All other animals have one determinatemode of progression, which in every kind is always the same;it is birds alone that have two modes of moving-the one onthe ground, the other in the air. Some of them walk, suchas the crow, for instance; some hop, as the sparrow and theblackbird; some, again, run, as the partridge and the woodhen;while others throw one foot before the other, the stork and thecrane, for instance. Then again, in their flight, some birds expand their wings, and, poising themselves in the air, only movethem from time to time; others move them more frequently,but then only at the extremities; while others expand themso as to expose the whole of the side. On the other hand,some fly with the greater part of the wings kept close tothe side; and some, after striking the air once, others twice,make their way through it, as though pressing upon it enclosedbeneath their wings; other birds dart aloft in a vertical direction, others horizontally, and others come falling straightdownwards. You would almost think that some had beenhurled upwards with a violent effort, and that others, again, hadfallen straight down from aloft; while others are seen to springforward in their flight. Ducks alone, and the other birds ofthat kind, in an instant raise themselves aloft, taking a springfrom the spot where they stand straight upwards towards theheavens; and this they can do from out of the water even;hence it is that they are the only birds that can make their<pb n="2521" />escape from the pitfalls which we employ for the capture ofwild beasts.</p><p>The vulture and the heavier wild birds can only fly after takinga run, or else by commencing their flight from an elevated spot.They use the tail by way of rudder. There are some birds thatare able to see all around them; others, again, have to turn theneck to do so. Some of them eat what they have seized, holdingit in their feet. Many, as they fly, utter some cry; while onthe other hand, many, in their flight, are silent. Some fly withthe breast half upright, others with it held downwards, othersfly obliquely, or else side-ways, and others following the direction of the bill. Some, again, are borne along with the headupwards; indeed the fact is, that if we were to see several kindsat the same moment, we should not suppose that they have tomake their way in the same element.</p></div2></body>
