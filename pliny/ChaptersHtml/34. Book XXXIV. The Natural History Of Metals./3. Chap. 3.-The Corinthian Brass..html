Formerly a mixture was madeof copper fused with gold and silver, and the workmanship inthis metal was considered even more valuable than the materialitself; but, at the present day, it is difficult to saywhether the workmanship in it, or the material, is the worst.Indeed, it is wonderful, that while the value of these works<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span><pb n="6150" />has so infinitely increased, the reputation of the art itself<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> isnearly extinct. But it would appear, that in this, as in everything else, what was formerly done for the sake of reputation,is now undertaken for the mere purpose of gain. Forwhereas this art was ascribed to the gods<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> themselves, andmen of rank in all countries endeavoured to acquire fame bythe practice of it, we have now so entirely lost the method ofmaking this valuable compound by fusion, that, for this longtime past, not even chance itself has assumed, in this department,the privilege which formerly belonged to art.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span></p><p>Next after the above compound, so celebrated in antiquity,the Corinthian metal has been the most highly esteemed. Thiswas a compound produced by accident, when Corinth was burntat the time of its capture.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> There has been a wonderful maniawith many for gaining possession of this metal. It is even said,that Verres, whom M. Cicero caused to be condemned, wasproscribed by Antonius, along with Cicero, for no other reasonthan his refusal to give up some specimens of Corinthian metal,which were in his possession. But most of these people seemto me to make a pretence of their discernment in reference tothis metal, rather for the purpose of distinguishing themselvesfrom the multitude, than from any real knowledge which theypossess; and this I will briefly show.</p><p>Corinth was captured in the third year of the 158thOlympiad, being the year of the City, 608,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> some ages after theperiod when those artists flourished, who produced all thespecimens of what these persons now call Corinthian metal.It is in order, therefore, to refute this opinion, that I shallstate the age when these different artists lived; for, if wereckon according to the above-mentioned era of the Olympiads,it will be easy to compare their dates with the correspondingyears of our City. The only genuine Corinthian vessels, then,<pb n="6151" />are those which these men of taste metamorphose, sometimesinto dishes, sometimes into lamps, or even into washing-basins,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>without any regard to decency. They are of threekinds; the white variety, approaching very nearly to thesplendour of silver, and in which that metal forms a largeproportion of the compound; a second kind, in which theyellow colour of gold predominates; and a third, in which allthe metals are mixed in equal proportions. Besides these,there is another mixture, the composition of which it is impossibleto describe, for although it has been formed intoimages and statues by the hand of man, it is chance that rulesin the formation of the compound. This last is highly prizedfor its colour, which approaches to that of liver, and it ison this account that it is called "hepatizon:"<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> it is far inferiorto the Corinthian metal, but much superior to theÆginetan and Delian, which long held the first rank.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He alludes to the <hi rend="ital">ancient</hi> works of art in this compound metal.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The art of making compound metals.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Vulcan, namely.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">No one has accidentally stumbled upon the art of making this compositemetal.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We have an account of the destruction of Corinth, and the accidentalformation of this compound, in Florus, B. ii. c. 16.
