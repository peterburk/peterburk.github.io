<div2 type="chapter" n="27" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 27. (21.)—WINE-VESSELS—WINE-CELLARS.</head><p>The various methods of keeping and storing wines in thecellar are very different. In the vicinity of the Alps, they puttheir wines in wooden vessels hooped around;<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> during theircold winters, they even keep lighted fires, to protect the winesfrom the effects of the cold. It is a singular thing to mention, but still it has been occasionally seen, that these vesselshave burst asunder, and there has stood the wine in frozenmasses; a miracle almost, as it is not ordinarily the nature ofwine to freeze, cold having only the effect of benumbing it.In more temperate climates, they place their wines in dolia,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>which they bury in the earth, either covering them entirely orin part, according to the temperature. Sometimes, again, theyexpose their wines in the open air, while at others they areplaced beneath sheds for protection from the atmosphere.<pb n="3269" /></p><p>The following are among the rules given for the propermanagement of wines:—One side of the wine-cellar, or, atall events, the windows, ought to face the north-east, or at leastdue east. All dunghills and roots of trees, and everything ofa repulsive smell, ought to be kept at as great a distance aspossible, wine being very apt to contract an odour. Fig-treestoo, either wild or cultivated, ought not to be planted in thevicinity. Intervals should also be left between the vessels,in order to prevent infection, in case of any of them turningbad, wine being remarkably apt to become tainted. Theshape, too, of the vessels is of considerable importance: thosethat are broad and bellying<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> are not so good.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> We find it recommended too, to pitch them immediately after the rising ofthe Dog-star, and then to wash them either with sea or saltwater, after which they should be sprinkled with the ashes oftree-shoots or else with potters' earth; they ought then to becleaned out, and perfumed with myrrh, a thing which oughtto be frequently done to the wine-cellars as well. Weak,thin wines should be kept<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> in dolia sunk in the ground, whilethose in which the stronger ones are kept should be more exposed to the air. The vessels ought on no account to be entirelyfilled, room being left for seasoning, by mixing either raisinwine or else defrutum flavoured with saffron; old pitch andsapa are sometimes used for the same purpose. The lids, too,of the dolia ought to be seasoned in a similar manner, withthe addition of mastich and Bruttian pitch.</p><p>It is strongly recommended never to open the vessels, except in fine weather; nor yet while a south wind is blowing,or at a full moon.</p><p>The flower<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> of wine when white is looked upon as a goodsign; but when it is red, it is bad, unless that should happento be the colour of the wine. The vessels, too, should not behot to the touch, nor should the covers throw out a sort ofsweat. When wine very soon flowers on the surface andemits an odour, it is a sign that it will not keep.</p><p>As to defrutum and sapa, it is recommended to commenceboiling them when there is no moon to be seen, or, in other<pb n="3270" />words, at the conjunction of that planet, and at no other time.Leaden<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> vessels should be used for this purpose, and not copper<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>ones, and walnuts are generally thrown into them, from anotion that they absorb<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> the smoke. In Campania they expose the very finest wines in casks in the open air, it being theopinion that it tends to improve the wine if it is exposed to theaction of the sun and moon, the rain and the winds.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Casks, in fact, similar to those used in France at the present day.
