<div2 type="chapter" n="21" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 21. (4.)—HOW GOLD IS FOUND.</head><p>Gold is found in our own part of the world; not to mentionthe gold extracted from the earth in India by the ants,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> andin Scythia by the Griffins.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> Among us it is procured inthree different ways; the first of which is, in the shape ofdust, found in running streams, the Tagus<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> in Spain, for instance,the Padus in Italy, the Hebrus in Thracia, the Pactolus inAsia, and the Ganges in India; indeed, there is no gold foundin a more perfect state than this, thoroughly polished as it isby the continual attrition of the current.</p><p>A second mode of obtaining gold is by sinking shafts or seekingit among the debris of mountains; both of which methodsit will be as well to describe. The persons in search of goldin the first place remove the "segutilum,"<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> such being the<pb n="6100" />name of the earth which gives indication of the presence ofgold. This done, a bed is made, the sand of which is washed,and, according to the residue found after washing, a conjectureis formed as to the richness of the vein. Sometimes, indeed,gold is found at once in the surface earth, a success, however,but rarely experienced. Recently, for instance, in the reign ofNero, a vein was discovered in Dalmatia, which yielded dailyas much as fifty pounds' weight of gold. The gold that isthus found in the surface crust is known as "talutium,"<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> incases where there is auriferous earth beneath. The mountainsof Spain,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> in other respects arid and sterile, and productive ofnothing whatever, are thus constrained by man to be fertile,in supplying him with this precious commodity.</p><p>The gold that is extracted from shafts is known by somepersons as "canalicium," and by others as "canaliense;"<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> itis found adhering to the gritty crust of marble,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> and, altogetherdifferent from the form in which it sparkles in the sapphirus<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>of the East, and in the stone of Thebais<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> and other gems, itis seen interlaced with the molecules of the marble. Thechannels of these veins are found running in various directionsalong the sides of the shafts, and hence the name of the goldthey yield—"canalicium."<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> In these shafts, too, the superincumbentearth is kept from falling in by means of woodenpillars. The substance that is extracted is first broken up,and then washed; after which it is subjected to the action offire, and ground to a fine powder. This powder is known as"apitascudes," while the silver which becomes disengaged inthe<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> furnace has the name of "sudor"<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> given to it. The im-<pb n="6101" />purities that escape by the chimney, as in the case of allother metals, are known by the name of "scoria." In thecase of gold, this scoria is broken up a second time, and meltedover again. The crucibles used for this purpose are made of"tasconium,"<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> a white earth similar to potter's clay in appearance;there being no other substance capable of with-standingthe strong current of air, the action of the fire, andthe intense heat of the melted metal.</p><p>The third method of obtaining gold surpasses the laboursof the Giants<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> even: by the aid of galleries driven to a longdistance, mountains are excavated by the light of torches, theduration of which forms the set times for work, the workmennever seeing the light of day for many months together.These mines are known as "arrugiæ;"<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> and not unfrequentlyclefts are formed on a sudden, the earth sinks in, and the workmenare crushed beneath; so that it would really appear less rashto go in search of pearls and purples at the bottom of the sea,so much more dangerous to ourselves have we made the earththan the water! Hence it is, that in this kind of mining,arches are left at frequent intervals for the purpose of supportingthe weight of the mountain above. In mining eitherby shaft or by gallery, barriers of silex are met with, whichhave to be driven asunder by the aid of fire and vinegar;<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> ormore frequently, as this method fills the galleries with suffocatingvapours and smoke, to be broken to pieces with bruising-machinesshod with pieces of iron weighing one hundred andfifty pounds: which done, the fragments are carried out on theworkmen's shoulders, night and day, each man passing themon to his neighbour in the dark, it being only those at the pit'smouth that ever see the light. In cases where the bed of silexappears too thick to admit of being penetrated, the miner tracesalong the sides of it, and so turns it. And yet, after all, the labourentailed by this silex is looked upon as comparatively easy, therebeing an earth—a kind of potter's clay mixed with gravel,"gangadia" by name, which it is almost impossible to overcome.This earth has to be attacked with iron wedges and hammers<pb n="6102" />like those previously mentioned,<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> and it is generally consideredthat there is nothing more stubborn in existence—except indeedthe greed for gold, which is the most stubborn of all things.</p><p>When these operations are all completed, beginning at thelast, they cut away<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> the wooden pillars at the point wherethey support the roof: the coming downfall gives warning,which is instantly perceived by the sentinel, and by him only,who is set to watch upon a peak of the same mountain. Byvoice as well as by signals, he orders the workmen to be immediatelysummoned from their labours, and at the samemoment takes to flight himself. The mountain, rent to pieces,is cleft asunder, hurling its debris to a distance with a crashwhich it is impossible for the human imagination to conceive;and from the midst of a cloud of dust, of a density quite incredible,the victorious miners gaze upon this downfall ofNature. Nor yet even then are they sure of gold, nor indeedwere they by any means certain that there was any to befound when they first began to excavate, it being quite sufficient,as an inducement to undergo such perils and to incursuch vast expense, to entertain the hope that they shall obtainwhat they so eagerly desire.</p><p>Another labour, too, quite equal to this, and one which entailseven greater expense, is that of bringing rivers<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> fromthe more elevated mountain heights, a distance in many instancesof one hundred miles perhaps, for the purpose ofwashing these debris. The channels thus formed are called"corrugi," from our word "corrivatio,"<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> I suppose; and evenwhen these are once made, they entail a thousand fresh labours.The fall, for instance, must be steep, that the water may beprecipitated, so to say, rather than flow; and it is in thismanner that it is brought from the most elevated points.Then, too, vallies and crevasses have to be united by the aid ofaqueducts, and in another place impassable rocks have to behewn away, and forced to make room for hollowed troughs ofwood; the person hewing them hanging suspended all thetime with ropes, so that to a spectator who views the operations<pb n="6103" />from a distance, the workmen have all the appearance, not somuch of wild beasts, as of birds upon the wing.<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> Hangingthus suspended in most instances, they take the levels, andtrace with lines the course the water is to take; and thus,where there is no room even for man to plant a footstep, arerivers traced out by the hand of man. The water, too, is consideredin an unfit state for washing, if the current of theriver carries any mud along with it. The kind of earth thatyields this mud is known as "urium;"<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span> and hence it is thatin tracing out these channels, they carry the water over bedsof silex or pebbles, and carefully avoid this urium. Whenthey have reached the head of the fall, at the very brow of themountain, reservoirs are hollowed out, a couple of hundredfeet in length and breadth, and some ten feet in depth. Inthese reservoirs there are generally five sluices left, aboutthree feet square; so that, the moment the reservoir is filled, thefloodgates are struck away, and the torrent bursts forth withsuch a degree of violence as to roll onwards any fragments ofrock which may obstruct its passage.</p><p>When they have reached the level ground, too, there isstill another labour that awaits them. Trenches—known as"agogæ"<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span>—have to be dug for the passage of the water; andthese, at regular intervals, have a layer of ulex placed at thebottom. This ulex<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span> is a plant like rosemary in appearance,rough and prickly, and well-adapted for arresting any piecesof gold that may be carried along. The sides, too, are closedin with planks, and are supported by arches when carried oversteep and precipitous spots. The earth, carried onwards inthe stream, arrives at the sea at last, and thus is the shatteredmountain washed away; causes which have greatly tended toextend the shores of Spain by these encroachments upon thedeep. It is also by the agency of canals of this descriptionthat the material, excavated at the cost of such immense labourby the process previously described,<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span> is washed and car-<pb n="6104" />ried away; for otherwise the shafts would soon be choked upby it.</p><p>The gold found by excavating with galleries does not requireto be melted, but is pure gold at once. In these excavations,too, it is found in lumps, as also in the shafts which are sunk,sometimes exceeding ten pounds even. The names given tothese lumps are "palagæ," and "palacurnæ,"<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span> while the goldfound in small grains is known as "baluce." The ulex thatis used for the above purpose is dried and burnt, after whichthe ashes of it are washed upon a bed of grassy turf, in orderthat the gold may be deposited thereupon.</p><p>Asturia, Gallæcia, and Lusitania furnish in this manner,yearly, according to some authorities, twenty thousand pounds'weight of gold, the produce of Asturia forming the major part.Indeed, there is no part of the world that for centuries hasmaintained such a continuous fertility in gold. I have already<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span>mentioned that by an ancient decree of the senate, the soil ofItaly has been protected from these researches; otherwise,there would be no land more fertile in metals. There is extantalso a censorial law relative to the gold mines of Victumulæ,in the territory of Vercellæ,<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span> by which the farmers of therevenue were forbidden to employ more than five thousandmen at the works.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xi. c. 36.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. vii. c. 2.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. iv. c. 17.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ajasson remarks, that the Castilians still call the surfaceearth of auriferous deposits by the name of <hi rend="ital">segullo.</hi> He alsodoubts the correctness ofPliny's assertion as to the produce of the mines of Dalmatia.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxxiv. c. 47.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We learn from Ajasson that numerous pits or shafts are still to beseen in Spain, from which the Romans extracted gold.
