It bears some resemblance to myrrh, but isvery difficult of access, by reason of the thorns with which itis armed. Here, too, a poisonous shrub is found, with a rootlike the radish,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and leaves like those of the laurel, By itspowerful odour it attracts horses, and was very nearly depriving Alexander of all his cavalry upon his first arrival there,an accident which also happened in Gedrosia. A thornyshrub<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> has been also spoken of as a native of the samecountry, with leaves like those of the laurel, the juice ofwhich, if sprinkled upon the eyes, is productive of blindnessin all animals. Another plant is also mentioned, with a mostremarkable odour, and full of diminutive serpents,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> the stingof which is sure to cause instant death. Onesicritus states,that in the vallies of Hyrcania, there is a tree resembling thefig, and known as the occhus,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> from which a honey distilsfor two hours every morning.<pb n="3116" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is unknown what plant is here alluded to by Pliny, but Sprengelsuggests that it is the Acacia latronum.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From the description, this would appear to be a sort of poisonoushorse-radish.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There is a tree in India, as we are informed by FŽe, which is knownas the Ex¾caria Agallochum, the juice of which is remarkably acrid.Sailors, on striking it with a hatchet, and causing the juice to spirt intotheir eyes, have been in danger of losing their sight. It is possible thatthis may be the tree here alluded to by Pliny.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He borrows the account of this marvellous shrub from Theophrastus.No such plant is likely to have ever existed; though small, and even large,snakes may occasionally take refuge among shrubs and hollow trees.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There is little doubt that the Hedysarum Alhagi of Linn¾us is heremeant, from which a kind of honey or manna flows, known as "Eastern "manna, or tereniabin. It is not so high as the fig-tree, and is found inKhorasan, Syria, Mesopotamia, and elsewhere. The manna distils prin-cipally in the morning.</p></body>
