B. v. 1. 450, <hi rend="ital">et seq.</hi> Pliny also mentions this in B. xxix. c. 4,though he speaks of some difference in their appearance. It is a speciesof gecko, the tarentola of Italy, the tarente of Provence, and the geckotta,probably, of Lacepède. The gecko, Cuvier says, is not venomous; but itcauses small blisters to rise on the skin when it walks over it, the result,probably, of the extreme sharpness of its nails.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See c. 28 of this Book, and B. viii. c. 95; B. xxx. c. 27.</p></body>
