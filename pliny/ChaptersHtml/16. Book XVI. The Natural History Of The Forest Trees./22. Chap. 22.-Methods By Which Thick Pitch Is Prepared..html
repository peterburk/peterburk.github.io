This liquid, thrown againinto a brazen cauldron, and mixed with vinegar, becomes still<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>thicker, and when left to coagulate, receives the name of"Bruttian"<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> pitch. It is used, however, only for pitching theinsides of dolia<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and other vessels, it differing from the otherkinds in being more viscous, of a redder colour, and moreunctuous than is usually the case. All these varieties of pitchare prepared from the pitch-tree, by putting red-hot stones,with the resinous wood, in troughs made of strong oak; orif these troughs are not attainable, by piling up billets of the<pb n="3362" />wood in the method employed for the manufacture of charcoal.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> It is this pitch that is used for seasoning wine, beingfirst pounded and reduced to a fine powder: it is of a blackercolour, too, than the other sort. The same resin, if boiled gentlywith water, and then strained off, becomes viscous, and assumesa red colour; it is then known as "distilled"<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> pitch:" formaking this, the refuse portions of the resin and the bark ofthe tree are generally selected.</p><p>Another method is adopted for the manufacture of that usedas crapula.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> Raw flower of resin is taken, direct from thetree, with a plentiful sprinkling of small, thin chips of thewood. These are then pounded<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> down and passed through asieve, after which they are steeped in water, which is heatedtill it comes to a boil. The unctuous portion that is extractedfrom this is the best resin: it is but rarely to be met with,and then only in a few places in Italy, in the vicinity of theAlps: it is in considerable request for medicinal purposes.For this, they generally boil a congius of white resin to twocongii of rain-water:<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> some persons, however, think it better<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>to boil it without water for one whole day by a slow fire,taking care to use a vessel of white copper.<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> Some, again,are in the habit of boiling the resin of the terebinth<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> in a flatpan<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> placed upon hot ashes, and prefer it to any other kind.The resin of the mastich<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> is held in the next degree of estimation.<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span><pb n="3363" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is impracticable; neither vinegar, wine, nor water, will minglewith pitch. These resins, however, if stirred up briskly in hot water, become of a paler colour, and acquire an additional suppleness.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Perhaps so called from Calabria, a country where the pine abounded,and part of which was called Bruttium.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or wine-vats.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See c. 8 of the present Book.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Stillaticia.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xiv. c. 25.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This operation removes from the pitch a great portion of its essentialoil, and disengages it of any extraneous bodies that may have been mixedwith it.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Fée remarks that there is no necessity for this selection, though nodoubt rain-water is superior to spring or cistern water, for some purposes,from its holding no terreous salts in solution.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This would colour the resin more strongly, Fée says, and give it agreater degree of friability.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxxiv. c. 20.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xiv. c. 25, and B. xxiv. c. 22.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Sartago." Generally understood to be the same as our frying-pan.Fée remarks that this method would most inevitably cause the mass infusion to ignite; and should such not be the case, a coloured resin wouldbe the result, coloured with a large quantity of carbon, and destitute of allthe essential oil that the resin originally contained.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xiv. c. 20.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The terebinthine of the mastich, Fée says, is an oleo-resin, or inother words, composed of an essential oil and a resin.</p></body>
