<div2 type="chapter" n="62" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 62. (38.)—HOW WOOLS ARE DYED WITH THE JUICES OF THE PURPLE.</head><p>The most favourable season for taking these fish is after therising of the Dog-star, or else before spring; for when they haveonce discharged<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> their waxy secretion, their juices have noconsistency: this, however, is a fact unknown in the dyers'workshops, although it is a point of primary importance.After it is taken, the vein is extracted, which we have<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> previously spoken of, to which it is requisite to add salt, a sextarius<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> about to every hundred pounds of juice. It is sufficientto leave them to steep for a period of three days, and no<pb n="2446" />more, for the fresher they are, the greater virtue there isin the liquor. It is then set to boil in vessels of tin,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> andevery hundred amphoræ<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> ought to be boiled down to five hundred pounds of dye, by the application of a moderate heat; forwhich purpose the vessel is placed at the end of a long funnel,which communicates with the furnace; while thus boiling,the liquor is skimmed from time to time, and with it the flesh,which necessarily adheres to the veins. About the tenth day,generally, the whole contents of the cauldron are in a liquifiedstate, upon which a fleece, from which the grease has beencleansed, is plunged into it by way of making trial; but untilsuch time as the colour is found to satisfy the wishes of thosepreparing it, the liquor is still kept on the boil. The tint thatinclines to red is looked upon as inferior to that which isof a blackish hue. The wool is left to lie in soak for fivehours, and then, after carding it, it is thrown in again, until ithas fully imbibed the colour. The juice of the buccinumis considered very inferior if employed by itself, as it is foundto discharge its colour; but when used in conjunction withthat of the pelagiæ, it blends<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> with it very well, gives a brightlustre to its colour, which is otherwise too dark, and impartsthe shining crimson hue of the kermes-Berry, a tint that isparticularly valued. By the admixture of their respectivevirtues these colours are thus heightened or rendered sombreby the aid of one another. The proper proportions for mixingare, for fifty pounds of wool, two hundred pounds of juice of thebuccinum and one hundred and eleven of juice of the pelagiæ.<pb n="2447" />From this combination is produced the admirable tint knownas amethyst colour.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> To produce the Tyrian hue the wool issoaked in the juice of the pelagiæ while the mixture is in anuncooked and raw state; after which its tint is changed bybeing dipped in the juice of the buccinum. It is considered ofthe best quality when it has exactly the colour of clotted blood,and is of a blackish hue to the sight, but of a shining appearance when held up to the light; hence it is that we findHomer speaking of "purple blood."<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Quum cerificavere." Cuvier remarks that Aristotle, Hist. Anim.B. v. c. 14, says, that these shell-fish make "waxen combs," meaningthereby collections of cells, similar to those formed by the bee; and it isto this notion that Pliny refers in the use of the word "cerificavere." It isthe fact, Cuvier says, that the univalve sea shell-fish, and more particularlythe buccini and the murices, envelope their eggs with glutinous vesicles ofvaried forms, according to the respective species; which, when massed together, may be not inappropriately termed "combs."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In c. 60. As Cuvier remarks, with considerable justice, this description by Pliny of the process of dyeing in purple, is very difficult to explain,seeing that the art is now entirely lost. Reaumur, he says, made someattempts at dyeing with a small buccinum found off the French coasts, theBuccinum lapillus of Linnæus; but without any result.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">About twenty ounces.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Because iron or brazen vessels might impart a tinge to the colour.The same would probably be the case if the word "plumbo "were to beconsidered as signifying "lead." As, however, Pliny uses this word inthe signification of "tin," it is most probable that that is his meaning.Littré, however, translates the word "plombe," "lead."</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hardouin says, that the weight of the contents of the amphora wouldbe about eighty pounds: it would therefore take eight thousand pounds ofmaterial, to make five hundred pounds of dye. The passage, however, whichruns as follows, "Fervere in plumbo, singulasque amphoras centenas adquingentenas medicaminis libras aequari," may be rendered, "It is thenset to boil in vessels of tin, and every hundred amphoræ of water ought tohe proportioned to five hundred pounds of the material;" indeed, thisis probably the correct translation, though Littré, who is generally veryexact, adopts that given in the text.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Alligatur:" which word may also mean, that mixed with the buccinum, it will hold fast, and not speedily fade or wash out.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">So called from the gem of that name; see B. xxxvii. c. 40.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot"><foreign lang="greek">Ai(/mati porfure/w|.</foreign> II.
