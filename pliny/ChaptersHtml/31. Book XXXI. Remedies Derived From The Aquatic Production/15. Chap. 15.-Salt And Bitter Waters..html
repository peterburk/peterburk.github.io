It is full, he says, of white serpents, twenty cubitslong.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> He mentions, also, a certain spring in Arabia, whichrises from the ground with such remarkable force, as to throwback any object pressed down upon it, however weighty.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Lacum insanum."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Juba has been deceived, Ajasson remarks, by the tales of travellers,there being no serpents of this length in Africa, except boas.
