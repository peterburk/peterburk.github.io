<div2 type="chapter" n="47" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 47.—METHODS OF REMOVING SUPERFLUOUS HAIR.DEPILATORIES.</head><p>Depilatories are prepared from the blood, gall, and liver of thetunny, either fresh or preserved; as also from pounded liver ofthe same fish, preserved with cedar resin<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> in a leaden box; a re-<pb n="6056" />cipe which we find given by the midwife Salpe<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> for disguisingthe age of boys on sale for slaves. A similar property belongsto the pulmo marinus,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> to the blood and gall of the sea-hare,and to the sea-hare itself, stifled in oil. The same, too, withashes of burnt crabs or sea scolopendræ,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> mixed with oil;sea-nettles,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> bruised in squill vinegar; and brains of the torpedo<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>applied with alum on the sixteenth day of the moon.The thick matter emitted by the small frogs, which we havedescribed when treating<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> of eye-diseases, is a most efficientdepilatory, if applied fresh: the same, too, with the frog itself,dried and pounded, and then boiled down to one-third in threeheminæ of water, or else boiled in a copper vessel with oil in alike proportion. Others, again, prepare a depilatory from fifteenfrogs, in manner already<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> stated under the head of remediesfor the eyes. Leeches, also, grilled in an earthen vessel, andapplied with vinegar, have the same property as a depilatory;the very odour, too, which attaches to the persons who thus burnthem is singularly efficacious for killing bugs.<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> Cases are to befound, too, where persons have used castoreum with honey,for many days together, as a depilatory. In the case, however,of every depilatory, the hairs should always be removed beforeit is applied.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Cedrium."
