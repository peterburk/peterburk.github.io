Applied with oil of roses in wool, it causes scurf uponthe face to disappear: some persons add butter to it. In casesof morphew, the spots are first pricked with a needle, and thenrubbed with dog's gall. For livid spots and bruises on theface, the lights of a ram or sheep are cut fine and appliedwarm, or else pigeons' dung is used. Goose-grease or poultry-grease is a good preservative of the skin of the face. Forlichens a liniment is used, made of mouse-dung in vinegar, orof the ashes of a hedge-hog mixed with oil: but, when theseremedies are employed, it is recommended first to foment theface with nitre dissolved in vinegar. Maladies of the face are alsoremoved by employing the ashes of the small, broad, snail thatis so commonly found, mixed with honey. Indeed, the ashesof all snails are of an inspissative nature, and are possessed ofcertain calorific and detersive properties: hence it is that theyform an ingredient in caustic applications, and are used in theform of a liniment for itch-scabs, leprous sores, and freckles onthe face.</p><p>I find it stated that a certain kind of ant known by the nameof "Herculanea,"<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> is beaten up, with the addition of a little<pb n="5433" />salt, and used for the cure of these diseases. The buprestis<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>is an insect but rarely found in Italy, and very similar to ascarabæus, with long legs. Concealed among the grass, it isvery liable to be swallowed unobserved, by oxen in particular;and the moment it comes in contact with the gall, it causessuch a degree of inflammation, that the animal bursts asunder;a circumstance to which the insect owes its name. Appliedtopically with he-goat suet, it removes lichens on the face,owing to its corrosive properties, as previously<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> stated. Avulture's blood, beaten up with cedar resin and root of whitechamæleon—a plant which we have already<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> mentioned—andcovered with a cabbage leaf, when applied, is good for the cureof leprosy; the same, too, with the legs of locusts, beaten upwith he-goat suet. Pimples are treated with poultry grease,beaten up and kneaded with onions. One very useful substance for the face is honey in which the bees have died; but asovereign detergent for that part is swans' grease, which hasalso the property of effacing wrinkles. Brand-marks<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> areremoved by using pigeons' dung, diluted in vinegar.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Dalechamps thinks that these "Herculean" ants were so called fromtheir great size.
