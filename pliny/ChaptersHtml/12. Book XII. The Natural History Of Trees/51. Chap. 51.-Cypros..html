The price ofit is five denarii per pound. The best is that produced on thebanks of the Nile, near Canopus, that of second quality comingfrom Ascalon in Judæa, and the third in estimation for thesweetness of its odour, from the island of Cyprus. Some peoplewill have it that this is the same as the tree which in Italy wecall ligustrum.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The henné, the Lawsonia inermis of the modern naturalists, a shrubfound in Egypt, Syria, and Barbary.
