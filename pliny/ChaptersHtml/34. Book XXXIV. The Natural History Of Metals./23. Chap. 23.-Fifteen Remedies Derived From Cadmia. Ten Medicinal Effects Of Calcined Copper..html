TENMEDICINAL EFFECTS OF CALCINED COPPER.</head><p>Cadmia<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> acts as a desiccative, heals wounds, arrests discharges,acts detergently upon webs and foul incrustations ofthe eyes, removes eruptions, and produces, in fact, all the goodeffects which we shall have occasion to mention when speakingof lead. Copper too, itself, when calcined, is employed forall these purposes; in addition to which it is used for whitespots and cicatrizations upon the eyes. Mixed with milk, itis curative also of ulcers upon the eyes; for which purpose,the people in Egypt make a kind of eye-salve by grinding itupon whet stones. Taken with honey, it acts as an emetic.For these purposes, Cyprian copper is calcined in unbakedearthen pots, with an equal quantity of sulphur; the aperturesof the vessel being well luted, and it being left in the furnaceuntil the vessel itself has become completely hardened. Somepersons add salt, and others substitute alum<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> for sulphur;others, again, add nothing, but merely sprinkle the copper withvinegar. When calcined, it is pounded in a mortar of Thebaicstone,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> after which it is washed with rain water, and then<pb n="6194" />pounded with a large quantity of water, and left to settle.This process is repeated until the deposit has gained theappearance of minium;<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> after which it is dried in the sun, andput by for keeping in a box made of copper.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We have the same account of the medicinal effects of Cadmia, andthe other preparations mentioned in this Chapter, given by Dioscorides.—B.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">For an account of the "alumen" of the ancients, see B. xxxv. c. 52.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxxiii. c. 21, and B. xxxvi. c. 13.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxxiii. c. 37.</p></body>
