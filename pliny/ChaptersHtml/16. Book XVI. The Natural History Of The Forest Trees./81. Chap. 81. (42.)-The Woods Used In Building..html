<div2 type="chapter" n="81" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 81. (42.)—THE WOODS USED IN BUILDING.</head><p>We have in Italy some woods that are apt to split ofthemselves: to prevent this, architects recommend that theyshould be first seasoned in manure<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and then dried, in orderto render them proof against the action of the atmosphere.The woods of the fir and larch are well adapted, even whenused transversely, for the support of heavy burdens; while therobur and the olive are apt to bend and give way under aweight. The wood of the poplar and the palm are also strong,but this last will bend, though in a manner different fromthe others; for, while in all other instances the wood bendsdownwards, in the palm it bends in the contrary direction,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>and forms an arch. The woods of the pine and the cypressare proof against decay and all attacks of wood-worm. Thewalnut is easily warped, but we sometimes see beams evenmade of it. It gives warning, however, before it breaks, by aloud cracking noise; such was the case at Antandros, at thepublic baths there—the bathers took the alarm upon hearingthe beams crack, and made their escape. The pine, the pitch-tree, and the alder are employed for making hollow pipes forthe conveyance, of water, and when buried in the earth willlast for many years. If, however, they are not well coveredover, they will very soon rot; and the resistance they offer todecay will increase in a most surprising degree if the outersurface as well is left in contact with the water.<pb n="3427" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This process, Fée says, would be attended with no success.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is not quite clear whether he intends this observation to apply to thepoplar and the palm, or to the last only.
