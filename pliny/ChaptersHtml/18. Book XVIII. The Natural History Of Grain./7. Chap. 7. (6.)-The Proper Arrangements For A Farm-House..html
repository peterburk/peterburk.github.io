<div2 type="chapter" n="7" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 7. (6.)—THE PROPER ARRANGEMENTS FOR A FARM-HOUSE.</head><p>The proper plan to be pursued is this:<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> the farm-house mustnot be unsuitable for the farm, nor the farm for the house; andwe must be on our guard against following the examples of L.Lucullus and Q. Scævola, who, though living in the same age,fell into the two opposite extremes; for whereas the farm-houseof Scævola was not large enough for the produce of his farm,the farm of Lucullus was not sufficiently large for the house hebuilt upon it; an error which gave occasion to the reproof ofthe censors, that on his farm there was less of ground forploughing than of floor for sweeping. The proper arrange-ments for a farm-house are not to be made without a certaindegree of skill. C. Marius, who was seven times consul, wasthe last person who had one built at Misenum;<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> but he erectedit with such a degree of that artistic skill which he had displayed in castrametation, that Sylla Felix<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> even made theremark, that in comparison with Marius, all the others hadbeen no better than blind.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span></p><p>It is generally agreed, that a farm-house ought neither tobe built near a marsh, nor with a river in front of it; for, as<pb n="4014" />Homer<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> has remarked, with the greatest correctness, unwholesome vapours are always exhaled from rivers before the risingof the sun. In hot localities, a farm-house should have anorthern aspect, but where it is cold, it should look towardsthe south; where, on the other hand, the site is temperate, thehouse should look due east. Although, when speaking<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> ofthe best kinds of soil, I may seem to have sufficiently discussedthe characteristics by which it may be known, I shall take thepresent opportunity of adding a few more indications, employing the words of Cato<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> more particularly for the purpose."The dwarf-elder," says he, "the wild plum,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> the bramble,the small bulb,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> trefoil, meadow grass,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> the quercus, and thewild pear and wild apple, are all of them indicative of a cornland. The same is the case, too, where the land is black, orof an ashy colour. All chalky soils are scorching, unless theyare very thin; the same, too, with sand, unless it is remarkablyfine. These remarks, however, are more applicable to champaign localities than declivities."</p><p>The ancients were of opinion, that before everything, moderation should be observed in the extent of a farm; for it wasa favourite maxim of theirs, that we ought to sow the less, andplough the more: such too, I find, was the opinion entertainedby Virgil,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> and indeed, if we must confess the truth, it is thewide-spread domains that have been the ruin<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> of Italy, andsoon will be that of the provinces as well. Six proprietorswere in possession of one half of Africa,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> at the period when<pb n="4015" />the Emperor Nero had them put to death. With that greatness of mind which was so peculiarly his own, and of whichhe ought not to lose the credit, Cneius Pompeius would neverpurchase the lands that belonged to a neighbour. Mago hasstated it as his opinion, that a person, on buying a farm, oughtat once to sell his town house;<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> an opinion, however, whichsavours of too great rigidity, and is by no means conformable tothe public good. It is with these words, indeed, that he beginshis precepts; a good proof, at all events, that he looks upon thepersonal inspection of the owner as of primary importance.</p><p>The next point which requires our care is to employ a farmsteward<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> of experience, and upon this, too, Cato<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> has givenmany useful precepts. Still, however, it must suffice forme to say that the steward ought to be a man nearly as cleveras his master, though without appearing to know it. It is thevery worst plan of all, to have land tilled by slaves let loosefrom the houses of correction, as, indeed, is the case with allwork entrusted to men who live without hope. I may possiblyappear guilty of some degree of rashness in making mention ofa maxim of the ancients, which will very probably be lookedupon as quite incredible—"That nothing is so disadvantageousas to cultivate land in the highest style of perfection." L.Tarius Rufus, a man who, born in the very lowest ranks oflife, by his military talents finally attained the consulship,<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span>and who in other respects adhered to the old-fashioned notionsof thriftiness, made away with about one hundred millions ofsesterces, which, by the liberality of the late Emperor Augustus, he had contrived to amass, in buying up lands in Picenum,and cultivating them in the highest style, his object being togain a name thereby; the consequence of which was, that hisheir renounced<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> the inheritance. Are we of opinion, then,that ruin and starvation must be the necessary consequence ofsuch a course as this? Yes, by Hercules! and the very bestplan of all is to let moderation guide our judgment in all things.To cultivate land well is absolutely necessary, but to cultivate<pb n="4016" />it in the very highest style is mere extravagance, unless, indeed, the work is done by the hands of a man's own family, histenants, or those whom he is obliged to keep at any rate. Butbesides this, even when the owner tills the land itself, thereare some crops which it is really not worth the while to gather,if we only take into account the manual labour expended uponthem. The olive, too, should never be too highly<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> cultivated,nor must certain soils, it is said, be too carefully tilled, thoseof Sicily,<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> for instance; hence it is, that new comers there sooften find themselves deceived.<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cato, c. 3.
