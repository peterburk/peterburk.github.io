<div2 type="chapter" n="42" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 42.—PECULIAR REMEDIES DERIVED FROM VARIOUS ANIMALS,AND CLASSIFIED ACCORDING TO THE MALADIES. REMEDIESAGAINST THE POISON OF SERPENTS, DERIVED FROM THE STAG,THE FAWN, THE OPHION, THE SHE-GOAT, THE KID, AND THEASS.</head><p>We will therefore classify the various remedies, accordingto the maladies for which they are respectively used; and, firstof all, those to which man has recourse for injuries inflicted by<pb n="5329" />serpents. That deer are destructive to those reptiles<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> no oneis ignorant; as also of the fact that they drag them from theirholes when they find them, and so devour them. And it isnot only while alive and breathing that deer are thus fatal toserpents, but even when dead and separated limb from limb.The fumes of their horns, while burning, will drive awayserpents, as already<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> stated; but the bones, it is said, of theupper part of a stag's throat, if burnt upon a fire, will bring thosereptiles together. Persons may sleep upon a deer's skin inperfect safety, and without any apprehension of attacks byserpents; its rennet too, taken with vinegar, is an effectual antidote to the stings of those reptiles; indeed, if it has been onlytouched by a person, he will be for that day effectually protected from them. The testes, dried, or the genitals of themale animal, are considered to be very wholesome, taken inwine, and so are the umbles, generally known as the "centipellio."<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> Persons having about them a deer's tooth, or whohave taken the precaution of rubbing the body with a deer orfawn's marrow, will be sure to repel the attacks of all serpents.</p><p>But the most effectual remedy of all is thought to be therennet of a fawn that has been cut from the uterus of thedam, as already<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> mentioned in another place. Deer's blood,burnt upon a fire of lentisk wood, with dracontium,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> cunilago,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>and alkanet, will attract serpents, they say; while, on theother hand, if the blood is removed and pyrethrum<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> substitutedfor it, they will take to flight.</p><p>I find an animal mentioned by Greek writers, smaller thanthe stag, but resembling it in the hair, and to which they givethe name of "ophion."<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> Sardinia, they say, is the only country that produces it; I am of opinion, however, that it is nowextinct, and for that reason I shall not enlarge upon its medicinal properties.</p><p>(10.) As a preservative against the attacks of serpents, thebrains and blood of the wild boar are held in high esteem:the liver also, dried and taken in wine with rue; and the fat,<pb n="5330" />used with honey and resin. Similar properties are attributedto the liver of the domesticated boar and the outer filaments,and those only, of the gall, these last being taken in doses offour denarii; the brains also, taken in wine, are equally ef-fectual. The fumes of the burning horns or hair of a she-goatwill repel serpents, they say: the ashes, too, of the horns, usedeither internally or externally, are thought to be an antidoteto their poison. A similar effect is attributed to goats' milk,taken with Taminian<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> grapes; to the urine of those animals,taken with squill vinegar; to goats' milk cheese, applied withoriganum;<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> and to goat suet, used with wax.</p><p>In addition to all this, as will be seen hereafter, there are athousand other remedial properties attributed to this animal;a fact which surprises me all the more, seeing that the goat,it is said, is never free from fever.<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> The wild animals of thesame species, which are very numerous, as already<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> stated,have a still greater efficacy attributed to them; but the hegoat has certain properties peculiar to itself, and Democritusattributes properties still more powerful to the animal when ithas been the only one yeaned. It is recommended also to applyshe-goat's dung, boiled<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> in vinegar, to injuries inflicted byserpents, as also the ashes of fresh dung mixed with wine.As a general rule, persons who find that they are recoveringbut slowly from injuries inflicted by a serpent, will find theirhealth more speedily re-established by frequenting the stallswhere goats are kept. Those, however, whose object is a moreassured remedy, attach immediately to the wound the paunchof a she-goat killed for the purpose, dung and all. Others,again, use the flesh of a kid just killed, and fumigate it withthe singed hair, the smell of which has the effect of repellingserpents.</p><p>For stings of serpents, as also for injuries inflicted by thescorpion and shrew-mouse, some employ the skin of a goatnewly killed, as also the flesh and dung of a horse that hasbeen out at pasture, or a hare's rennet in vinegar. They say,too, that if a person has the body well rubbed with a hare'srennet, he will never receive injury from venomous animals.When a person has been stung by a scorpion, she-goat's dung,<pb n="5331" />boiled with vinegar, is considered a most efficient remedy: incases too, where a buprestis has been swallowed, bacon and thebroth in which it has been boiled, are highly efficacious. Nay,what is even more than this, if a person applies his mouth toan ass's ear, and says that he has been stung by a scorpion, thewhole of the poison, they say, will immediately pass awayfrom him and be transferred to the animal. All venomouscreatures, it is said, are put to flight by a fumigation madeby burning an ass's lights. It is considered an excellentplan too, to fumigate persons, when stung by a scorpion, withthe smoke of burnt calves' dung.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. viii. c. 50.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. viii. c. 50.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "hundred skins."
