The andrachne is awild tree, which never grows in the plain country, and is similar to the arbute tree in appearance, only that its leaves aresmaller, and never fall off. The bark, too, is not rough, butmight be taken to be frozen all over, so truly wretched is itsappearance.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In the former editions, "adrachne"Ñthe Arbutus integrifolia, Feesays, and not the Arbutus andrachne of Linn¾us, as Sprengel thinks.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Porcillaca."
