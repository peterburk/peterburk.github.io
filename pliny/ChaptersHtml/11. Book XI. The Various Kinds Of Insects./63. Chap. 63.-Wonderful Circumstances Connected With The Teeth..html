Whileother<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> animals keep their teeth to the time of their death,man, the lion, the beasts of burden, the dog, and the ruminating animals, all change them; the lion and the dog, however, change none<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> but the canine teeth. The canine tooth ofthe wolf, on the right side, is held in high esteem as an amulet.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>There is no animal that changes the maxillary teeth, whichstand beyond the canine teeth. With man, the last teeth,which are known as the " genuini," or cheek teeth,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> comeabout the twentieth year, and with many men, and females aswell, so late even as the eightieth; but this only in the caseof those who have not had them in their youth. It is awell-known fact, that the teeth are sometimes shed in old age,and replaced by others. Mucianus has stated that he, himself,saw one Zocles, a native of Samothrace, who had a new set ofteeth when he was past his one hundred and fourth year. Inaddition to these facts, in man males have more teeth thanfemales,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> which is the case also in sheep, goats, and swine.<pb n="3060" />Timarchus, the son of Nicocles the Paphian, had a double<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>row of teeth in his jaws: the same person had a brother alsowho never changed his front teeth, and, consequently, worethem to the very stumps. There is an instance, also, of a manhaving a tooth growing in the palate.<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> The canine teeth,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>when lost by any accident, are never known to come again.While in all other animals the teeth grow of a tawny colourwith old age, with the horse, and him only, they become whiterthe older he grows.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Very few other animals are born with teeth, in their natural state.Apes, dogs, and cats are not born with teeth.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From the fourth to the eighth month in reality, during which thefour central incisors appear.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The only ones that do not change are those which have three molarson each side of the jaw.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is erroneous: they change the incisors and molars as well.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxviii. c. 78.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">By us known as the "wisdom" teeth.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is not the fact: they have usually the same number, but thereare exceptions on both sides.
