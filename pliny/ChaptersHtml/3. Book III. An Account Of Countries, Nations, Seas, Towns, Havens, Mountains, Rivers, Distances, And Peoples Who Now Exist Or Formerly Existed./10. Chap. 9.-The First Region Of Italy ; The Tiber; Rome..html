<div2 type="chapter" n="9" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 9.ÑTHE FIRST REGION OF ITALY<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>; THE TIBER; ROME.</head><p>The Tiber or Tiberis, formerly called Thybris, and previously Albula<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>, flows down from nearly the central part ofthe chain of the Apennines, in the territory of the Arretini.It is at first small, and only navigable by means of sluices,in which the water is dammed up and then discharged, in thesame manner as the Timia<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and the Glanis, which flow intoit; for which purpose it is found necessary to collect the waterfor nine days, unless there should happen to be a fall of rain.And even then, the Tiber, by reason of its rugged and unevenchannel, is really more suitable for navigation by rafts thanby vessels, for any great distance. It winds along for acourse of 150 miles, passing not far from Tifernum<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, Perusia,and Ocriculum<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>, and dividing Etruria from the Umbri<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> andthe Sabini<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>, and then, at a distance of less than sixteen<pb n="1192" />miles from the city, separating the territory of Veii fromthat of Crustuminum, and afterwards that of the Fidenatesand of Latium from Vaticanum.</p><p>Below its union with the Glanis from Arretinum the Tiberis swollen by two and forty streams, particularly the Nar<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>and the Anio, which last is also navigable and shuts inLatium at the back; it is also increased by the numerousaqueducts and springs which are conveyed to the City. Hereit becomes navigable by vessels of any burden which may comeup from the Italian sea; a most tranquil dispenser of theproduce of all parts of the earth, and peopled and embellishedalong its banks with more villas than nearly all the otherrivers of the world taken together. And yet there is noriver more circumscribed than it, so close are its banks shutin on either side; but still, no resistance does it offer, althoughits waters frequently rise with great suddenness, and no partis more liable to be swollen than that which runs throughthe City itself. In such case, however, the Tiber is ratherto be looked upon<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> as pregnant with prophetic warnings tous, and in its increase to be considered more as a promoterof religion than a source of devastation.</p><p>Latium<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> has preserved its original limits, from the Tiberto Circeii<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>, a distance of fifty miles: so slender at the beginning were the roots from which this our Empire sprang.Its inhabitants have been often changed, and differentnations have peopled it at different times, the Aborigines,<pb n="1193" />the Pelasgi, the Arcades, the Seculi, the Aurunci, the Rutuli,and, beyond Circeii, the Volsci, the Osci, and the Ausoneswhence the name of Latium came to be extended as far asthe river Liris<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>.</p><p>We will begin with Ostia<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>, a colony founded by a king ofRome, the town of Laurentum<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>, the grove of Jupiter Indiges<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>, the river Numicius<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span>, and Ardea<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span>, founded by Dana‘, themother of Perseus. Next come the former site of Aphrodisium<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span>, the colony of Antium<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span>, the river and island calledAstura<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span>, the river Nymph¾us<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span>, the Clostra Romana<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span>, andCirceii<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span>, formerly an island, and, if we are to believe Homer,surrounded by the open sea, though now by an extensive plain.The circumstances which we are enabled to publish on thissubject for the information of the world are very remarkable.Theophrastus, the first foreigner who treated of the affairs ofRome with any degree of accuracy (for Theopompus, beforewhose time no Greek writer had made mention of us, only<pb n="1194" />stated the fact that the city had been taken by the Gauls,and Clitarchus, the next after him, only spoke of the embassythat was sent by the Romans to Alexander)ÑTheophrastus,I say, following something more than mere rumour, hasgiven the circuit of the island of Circeii as being eighty stadia,in the volume which he wrote during the archonship of Nicodorus at Athens<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span>, being the 440th year of our city. Whatever land therefore has been annexed to that island beyond thecircumference of about ten miles, has been added to Italysince the year previously mentioned.</p><p>Another wonderful circumstance too.ÑNear Circeii arethe Pomptine Marshes<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span>, formerly the site, according toMucianus, who was thrice consul, of four-and-twenty cities.Next to this comes the river Ufens<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span>, upon which is thetown of Terracina<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span>, called, in the language of the Volsci,Anxur; the spot too where Amycl¾<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span> stood, a town destroyed by serpents. Next is the site of the Grotto<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span>, LakeFundanus<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span>, the port of Caieta<span id="ref_31"><a href="#note_31">[31]</a></span>, and then the town of Formi¾<span id="ref_32"><a href="#note_32">[32]</a></span>, formerly called Hormi¾, the ancient seat of the L¾strygones<span id="ref_33"><a href="#note_33">[33]</a></span>, it is supposed. Beyond this, formerly stood the<pb n="1195" />town of Pyr¾; and we then come to the colony of Minturn¾<span id="ref_34"><a href="#note_34">[34]</a></span>, which still exists, and is divided<span id="ref_35"><a href="#note_35">[35]</a></span> by the river Liris,also called the Glanis. The town of Sinuessa<span id="ref_36"><a href="#note_36">[36]</a></span> is the last inthe portion which has been added to Latium; it is said bysome that it used to be called Sinope.</p><p>At this spot begins that blessed country Campania<span id="ref_37"><a href="#note_37">[37]</a></span>, andin this vale first take their rise those hills clad with vines, thejuice of whose grape is extolled by Fame all over the world;the happy spot where, as the ancients used to say, fatherLiber and Ceres are ever striving for the mastery. Hencethe fields of Setia<span id="ref_38"><a href="#note_38">[38]</a></span> and of C¾cubum<span id="ref_39"><a href="#note_39">[39]</a></span> extend afar. and, nextto them those of Falernum<span id="ref_40"><a href="#note_40">[40]</a></span> and of Calinum<span id="ref_41"><a href="#note_41">[41]</a></span>. As soon as wehave passed these, the hills of Massica<span id="ref_42"><a href="#note_42">[42]</a></span>, of Gaurus<span id="ref_43"><a href="#note_43">[43]</a></span>, and ofSurrentum rise to our view. Next, the level plains of Laborium<span id="ref_44"><a href="#note_44">[44]</a></span> are spread out far and wide, where every care is bestowed on cultivating crops of spelt, from which the most delicate fermenty is made. These shores are watered by warmsprings<span id="ref_45"><a href="#note_45">[45]</a></span>, while the seas are distinguished beyond all othersfor the superlative excellence of their shell and other fish.<pb n="1196" />In no country too has the oil of the olive a more exquisiteflavour. This territory, a battle-ground as it were for thegratification of every luxurious pleasure of man, has beenheld successively by the Osci, the Greeks, the Umbri, theTusci, and the Campani.</p><p>On the coast we first meet with the river Savo<span id="ref_46"><a href="#note_46">[46]</a></span>, the townof Volturnum with a river<span id="ref_47"><a href="#note_47">[47]</a></span> of the same name, the town ofLiternum<span id="ref_48"><a href="#note_48">[48]</a></span>, Cum¾<span id="ref_49"><a href="#note_49">[49]</a></span>, a Chalcidian colony, Misenum<span id="ref_50"><a href="#note_50">[50]</a></span>, the portof Bai¾<span id="ref_51"><a href="#note_51">[51]</a></span>, Bauli<span id="ref_52"><a href="#note_52">[52]</a></span>, the Lucrine Lake<span id="ref_53"><a href="#note_53">[53]</a></span>, and Lake Avernus, nearwhich there stood formerly a town<span id="ref_54"><a href="#note_54">[54]</a></span> of the Cimmerians. Wethen come to Puteoli<span id="ref_55"><a href="#note_55">[55]</a></span>, formerly called the colony of Dic¾-<pb n="1197" />archia, then the Phlegr¾n<span id="ref_56"><a href="#note_56">[56]</a></span> Plains, and the Marsh ofAcherusia<span id="ref_57"><a href="#note_57">[57]</a></span> in the vicinity of Cum¾.</p><p>Again, on the coast we have Neapolis<span id="ref_58"><a href="#note_58">[58]</a></span>, also a colony ofthe Chalcidians, and called Parthenope from the tomb thereof one of the Sirens, Herculaneum<span id="ref_59"><a href="#note_59">[59]</a></span>, Pompeii<span id="ref_60"><a href="#note_60">[60]</a></span>, from whichMount Vesuvius may be seen at no great distance, andwhich is watered by the river Sarnus<span id="ref_61"><a href="#note_61">[61]</a></span>; the territory ofNuceria, and, at the distance of nine miles from the sea, thetown of that name<span id="ref_62"><a href="#note_62">[62]</a></span>, and then Surrentum<span id="ref_63"><a href="#note_63">[63]</a></span>, with the Promontory of Minerva<span id="ref_64"><a href="#note_64">[64]</a></span>, formerly the abode of the Sirens. Thedistance thence by sea to Circeii is seventy-eight miles This<pb n="1198" />region, beginning at the Tiber, is looked upon as the first ofItaly according to the division of Augustus.</p><p>Inland there are the following colonies:ÑCapua<span id="ref_65"><a href="#note_65">[65]</a></span>, socalled from its champaign country, Aquinum<span id="ref_66"><a href="#note_66">[66]</a></span>, Suessa<span id="ref_67"><a href="#note_67">[67]</a></span>, Venafrum<span id="ref_68"><a href="#note_68">[68]</a></span>, Sora<span id="ref_69"><a href="#note_69">[69]</a></span>, Teanum surnamed Sidicinum<span id="ref_70"><a href="#note_70">[70]</a></span>, Nola<span id="ref_71"><a href="#note_71">[71]</a></span>;and the towns of Abella<span id="ref_72"><a href="#note_72">[72]</a></span>, Aricia<span id="ref_73"><a href="#note_73">[73]</a></span>, Alba Longa<span id="ref_74"><a href="#note_74">[74]</a></span>, the Acer-<pb n="1199" />rani<span id="ref_75"><a href="#note_75">[75]</a></span>, the Allifani<span id="ref_76"><a href="#note_76">[76]</a></span>, the Atinates<span id="ref_77"><a href="#note_77">[77]</a></span>, the Aletrinates<span id="ref_78"><a href="#note_78">[78]</a></span>, theAnagnini<span id="ref_79"><a href="#note_79">[79]</a></span>, the Atellani<span id="ref_80"><a href="#note_80">[80]</a></span>, the Affilani<span id="ref_81"><a href="#note_81">[81]</a></span>, the Arpinates<span id="ref_82"><a href="#note_82">[82]</a></span>,the Auximates<span id="ref_83"><a href="#note_83">[83]</a></span>, the Abellani<span id="ref_84"><a href="#note_84">[84]</a></span>, the Alfaterni (both thosewho take their names from the Latin, the Hernicanand the Labicanian territory), Bovill¾<span id="ref_85"><a href="#note_85">[85]</a></span>, Calatia<span id="ref_86"><a href="#note_86">[86]</a></span>, Casi-<pb n="1200" />num<span id="ref_87"><a href="#note_87">[87]</a></span>, Calenum<span id="ref_88"><a href="#note_88">[88]</a></span>, Capitulum<span id="ref_89"><a href="#note_89">[89]</a></span> of the Hernici, the Cereatini<span id="ref_90"><a href="#note_90">[90]</a></span>, surnamed Mariani, the Corani<span id="ref_91"><a href="#note_91">[91]</a></span>, descended from theTrojan Dardanus, the Cubulterini, the CastrimÏnienses<span id="ref_92"><a href="#note_92">[92]</a></span>,the Cingulani<span id="ref_93"><a href="#note_93">[93]</a></span>, the Fabienses<span id="ref_94"><a href="#note_94">[94]</a></span> on the Alban Mount,the Foropopulienses<span id="ref_95"><a href="#note_95">[95]</a></span> of the Falernian district, the Frusinates<span id="ref_96"><a href="#note_96">[96]</a></span>, the Ferentinates<span id="ref_97"><a href="#note_97">[97]</a></span>, the Freginates<span id="ref_98"><a href="#note_98">[98]</a></span>, the oldFrabaterni<span id="ref_99"><a href="#note_99">[99]</a></span>, the new Frabaterni, the Ficolenses<span id="ref_100"><a href="#note_100">[100]</a></span>, the Fre-<pb n="1201" />gellani<span id="ref_101"><a href="#note_101">[101]</a></span>, Forum App”<span id="ref_102"><a href="#note_102">[102]</a></span>, the Forentani<span id="ref_103"><a href="#note_103">[103]</a></span>, the Gabini<span id="ref_104"><a href="#note_104">[104]</a></span>, theInteramnates Succasini<span id="ref_105"><a href="#note_105">[105]</a></span>, also surnamed Lirinates, theIlionenses Lavinii<span id="ref_106"><a href="#note_106">[106]</a></span>, the Norbani<span id="ref_107"><a href="#note_107">[107]</a></span>, the Nomentani<span id="ref_108"><a href="#note_108">[108]</a></span>, the Pr¾nestini<span id="ref_109"><a href="#note_109">[109]</a></span> (whose city was formerly called StephanŽ), the Privernates<span id="ref_110"><a href="#note_110">[110]</a></span>, the Setini<span id="ref_111"><a href="#note_111">[111]</a></span>, the Signini<span id="ref_112"><a href="#note_112">[112]</a></span>, the Suessulani<span id="ref_113"><a href="#note_113">[113]</a></span>, the<pb n="1202" />Telesini<span id="ref_114"><a href="#note_114">[114]</a></span>, the Trebulani, surnamed Balinienses<span id="ref_115"><a href="#note_115">[115]</a></span>, the Trebani<span id="ref_116"><a href="#note_116">[116]</a></span>, the Tusculani<span id="ref_117"><a href="#note_117">[117]</a></span>, the Verulani<span id="ref_118"><a href="#note_118">[118]</a></span>, the Veliterni<span id="ref_119"><a href="#note_119">[119]</a></span>, theUlubrenses<span id="ref_120"><a href="#note_120">[120]</a></span>, the Urbinates<span id="ref_121"><a href="#note_121">[121]</a></span>, and, last and greater thanall, Rome herself, whose other name<span id="ref_122"><a href="#note_122">[122]</a></span> the hallowed mysteriesof the sacred rites forbid us to mention without being guiltyof the greatest impiety. After it had been long kept buriedin secresy with the strictest fidelity and in respectful andsalutary silence, Valerius Soranus dared to divulge it, butsoon did he pay the penalty<span id="ref_123"><a href="#note_123">[123]</a></span> of his rashness.</p><p>It will not perhaps be altogether foreign to the purpose,if I here make mention of one peculiar institution of ourforefathers which bears especial reference to the inculcationof silence on religious matters. The goddess Angerona<span id="ref_124"><a href="#note_124">[124]</a></span>,to whom sacrifice is offered on the twelfth day before thecalends of January [21st December], is represented in herstatue as having her mouth bound with a sealed fillet.</p><p>Romulus left the city of Rome, if we are to believe those<pb n="1203" />who state the very greatest number, having three<span id="ref_125"><a href="#note_125">[125]</a></span> gates andno more. When the Vespasians were emperors<span id="ref_126"><a href="#note_126">[126]</a></span> and censors,in the year from its building 826, the circumference of thewalls which surrounded it was thirteen miles and two-fifths.Surrounding as it does the Seven Hills, the city is dividedinto fourteen districts, with 265 cross-roads<span id="ref_127"><a href="#note_127">[127]</a></span> under theguardianship of the Lares. If a straight line is drawnfrom the mile-column<span id="ref_128"><a href="#note_128">[128]</a></span> placed at the entrance of theForum, to each of the gates, which are at present thirty-seven in number (taking care to count only once thetwelve double gates, and to omit the seven old ones, whichno longer exist), the result will be [taking them altogether],a straight line of twenty miles and 765 paces<span id="ref_129"><a href="#note_129">[129]</a></span>. But if wedraw a straight line from the same mile-column to the verylast of the houses, including therein the Pr¾torian encampment, and follow throughout the line of all the streets, theresult will then be something more than seventy miles. Addto these calculations the height of the houses, and then aperson may form a fair idea of this city, and will certainlybe obliged to admit that there is not a place throughout thewhole world that for size can be compared to it. On the<pb n="1204" />eastern side it is bounded by the <hi rend="ital">agger</hi> of Tarquinius Superbus, a work of surpassing grandeur; for he raised itso high as to be on a level with the walls on the sideon which the city lay most exposed to attack from the neighbouring plains. On all the other sides it has been fortifiedeither with lofty walls or steep and precipitous hills<span id="ref_130"><a href="#note_130">[130]</a></span>, but soit is, that its buildings, increasing and extending beyond allbounds, have now united many other cities to it<span id="ref_131"><a href="#note_131">[131]</a></span>.</p><p>Besides those previously mentioned, there were formerlyin the first region the following famous towns of Latium:Satricum<span id="ref_132"><a href="#note_132">[132]</a></span>, Pometia<span id="ref_133"><a href="#note_133">[133]</a></span>, Scaptia, Politorium<span id="ref_134"><a href="#note_134">[134]</a></span>, Tellene, Tifata,C¾nina<span id="ref_135"><a href="#note_135">[135]</a></span>, Ficana<span id="ref_136"><a href="#note_136">[136]</a></span>, Crustumerium, Ameriola<span id="ref_137"><a href="#note_137">[137]</a></span>, Medullum<span id="ref_138"><a href="#note_138">[138]</a></span>,Corniculum<span id="ref_139"><a href="#note_139">[139]</a></span>, Saturnia<span id="ref_140"><a href="#note_140">[140]</a></span>, on the site of the present city of<pb n="1205" />Rome, Antipolis<span id="ref_141"><a href="#note_141">[141]</a></span>, now Janiculum, forming part of Rome,Antemn¾<span id="ref_142"><a href="#note_142">[142]</a></span>, Carnerium<span id="ref_143"><a href="#note_143">[143]</a></span>, Collatia<span id="ref_144"><a href="#note_144">[144]</a></span>, Amitinum<span id="ref_145"><a href="#note_145">[145]</a></span>, Norbe,Sulmo<span id="ref_146"><a href="#note_146">[146]</a></span>, and, with these, those Alban nations<span id="ref_147"><a href="#note_147">[147]</a></span> who used totake part in the sacrifices<span id="ref_148"><a href="#note_148">[148]</a></span> upon the Alban Mount, the Albani, the ®sulani<span id="ref_149"><a href="#note_149">[149]</a></span>, the Accienses, the Abolani, the Bube-<pb n="1206" />tani<span id="ref_150"><a href="#note_150">[150]</a></span>, the Bolani<span id="ref_151"><a href="#note_151">[151]</a></span>, the Cusuetani, the Coriolani<span id="ref_152"><a href="#note_152">[152]</a></span>, the Fidenates<span id="ref_153"><a href="#note_153">[153]</a></span>, the Foretii, the Hortenses<span id="ref_154"><a href="#note_154">[154]</a></span>, the Latinienses, theLongulani<span id="ref_155"><a href="#note_155">[155]</a></span>, the Manates, the Macrales, the Mutucumenses, the Munienses, the Numinienses, the Olliculani, theOctulani, the Pedani<span id="ref_156"><a href="#note_156">[156]</a></span>, the Polluscini, the Querquetulani, theSicani, the Sisolenses, the Tolerienses, the Tutienses, the Vimitellarii, the Velienses, the Venetulani, and the Vitellenses.Thus we see, fifty-three peoples of ancient Latium havepassed away without leaving any traces of their existence.</p><p>In the Campanian territory there was also the town ofStabi¾<span id="ref_157"><a href="#note_157">[157]</a></span>, until the consulship of Cneius Pompeius and L.Cato, when, on the day before the calends of May [30th ofApril], it was destroyed in the Social War by L. Sulla thelegatus, and all that now stands on its site is a single farmhouse. Here also Taurania has ceased to exist, and theremains of Casilinum<span id="ref_158"><a href="#note_158">[158]</a></span> are fast going to ruin. Besides these,<pb n="1207" />we learn from Antias that king L. Tarquinius took Apiol¾<span id="ref_159"><a href="#note_159">[159]</a></span>,a town of the Latins, and with its spoils laid the first foundations of the Capitol. From Surrentum<span id="ref_160"><a href="#note_160">[160]</a></span> to the riverSilarus<span id="ref_161"><a href="#note_161">[161]</a></span>, the former territory of Picentia<span id="ref_162"><a href="#note_162">[162]</a></span> extends for adistance of thirty miles.
