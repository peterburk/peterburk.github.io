<div2 type="chapter" n="46" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 46.—THE CROPS THAT SHOULD BE SOWN IN THE DIFFERENT SOILS.</head><p>This, then, is the opinion expressed by Cato<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> on the subject:"In a dense and fertile soil wheat should be sown: but if thelocality is subject to fogs, rape, radishes, millet, and panic.Where the land<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> is cold and moist, sowing should be commenced earlier; but where it is hot, at a later period. In ared, black, or gravelly soil, provided it is not watery, lupinesshould be sown; but in chalk, red earth, or a watery soil,spelt.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> Where a locality is dry, free from weeds, and notovershadowed, wheat should be put; in; and where the soil is<pb n="4060" />strong and powerful, beans. Vetches should be grown in asoil as free from water and weeds as possible; while wheatand winter wheat are best adapted to an open, elevated locality, fully exposed to the warmth of the sun, the lentilthrives best in a meager, red earth, free from weeds. Barley isequally suited for fallow land and for a soil that is not intendedto be fallow, and three-month wheat, for a soil upon which acrop of ordinary wheat would never ripen, but strong enoughto bear."</p><p>The following, too, is sound advice:<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> Those plants shouldbe sown in a thin soil which do not stand in need of muchnutriment, the cytisus, for instance, and such of the leguminousplants, with the exception of the chick-pea, as are taken upby the roots and not cut. From this mode of gathering them—"legers"—the leguminous derive their name. Where it is arich earth, those plants should be grown which require agreater proportion of nutriment, codeword for instance, wheat,winter-wheat, and flax. The result, then, will be, that alight soil will be given to barley—the root of that grain standing in need of less nutriment—while a more dense, thougheasily-worked soil, will be assigned to wheat. In humid localities spelt should be sown in preference to wheat; but wherethe soil is of moderate temperature, either wheat or barleymay be grown. Declivities produce a stronger growth ofwheat, but in smaller quantities. Spelt and winter-wheatadopt a moist, cretaceous soil in preference to any other.</p><p>(18.) The only occasion on which there ever was a prodigyconnected with grain, at least that I am aware of, was in theconsulship of P. Ælias and Census Cornelius, the year<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> inwhich Hannibal was vanquished: on that occasion, we findit stated, corn was seen growing upon trees.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">De Re Rust. c. 6.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">De Re Rust. c. 34.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Adore."
