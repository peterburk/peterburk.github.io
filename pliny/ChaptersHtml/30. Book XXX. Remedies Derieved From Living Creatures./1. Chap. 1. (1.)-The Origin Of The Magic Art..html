(1.)ÑTHE ORIGIN OF THE MAGIC ART.</head><p>IN former parts of this work, I have had occasion more than.once, when the subject demanded it, to refute the imposturesof the magic art, and it is now my intention to continue stillfurther my exposure thereof. Indeed, there are few subjectson which more might be profitably said, were it only that,being, as it is, the most deceptive of all known arts, it hasexercised the greatest influence in every country and in nearlyevery age. And no one can be surprised at the extent of itsinfluence and authority, when he reflects that by its own energies it has embraced, and thoroughly amalgamated with itself;the three other sciences<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> which hold the greatest sway uponthe mind of man.</p><p>That it first originated in medicine, no one entertains adoubt;<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> or that, under the plausible guise of promoting health,it insinuated itself among mankind, as a higher and more holybranch of the medical art. Then, in the next place, to promises the most seductive and the most flattering, it has addedall the resources of religion, a subject upon which, at the present day, man is still entirely in the dark. Last of all, tocomplete its universal sway, it has incorporated with itself theastrological art;<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> there being no man who is not desirous toknow his future destiny, or who is not ready to believe thatthis knowledge may with the greatest certainty be obtained,by observing the face of the heavens. The senses of menbeing thus enthralled by a three-fold bond, the art of magichas attained an influence so mighty, that at the present dayeven, it holds sway throughout a great part of the world, andrules the kings<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> of kings in the East.<pb n="5422" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Artes."
