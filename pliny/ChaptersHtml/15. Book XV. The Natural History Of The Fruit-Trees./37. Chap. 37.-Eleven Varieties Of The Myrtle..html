<div2 type="chapter" n="37" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 37.—ELEVEN VARIETIES OF THE MYRTLE.</head><p>Cato<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> makes mention of three varieties of the myrtle, theblack, white, and the conjugula, perhaps so called fromits reference to conjugal unions, and belonging to the samespecies as that which grew where Cluacina's statues nowstand: at the present day the varieties are differently distinguished into the cultivated and the wild<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> myrtle, each ofwhich includes a kind with a large leaf. The kind known as"oxymyrsine,"<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> belongs only to the wild variety: ornamentalgardeners classify several varieties of the cultivated kind; the"Tarentine,"<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> they speak of as a myrtle with a small leaf,the myrtle of this country<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> as having a broad leaf, and thehexasticha<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> as being very thickly covered with leaves, growingin rows of six: it is not, however, made any use of. Thereare two other kinds, that are branchy and well covered. Inmy opinion, the conjugula is the same that is now called theRoman myrtle. It is in Egypt that the myrtle is mostodoriferous.</p><p>Cato<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> has taught us how to make a wine from the blackmyrtle, by drying it thoroughly in the shade, and then puttingit in must: he says, also, that if the berries are not quite dry,it will produce an oil. Since his time a method has been discovered of making a pale wine from the white variety; twosextarii of pounded myrtle are steeped in three semi-sextarii ofwine, and the mixture is then subjected to pressure.</p><p>The leaves<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> also are dried by themselves till they are capable of being reduced to a powder, which is used for the treatment of sores on the human body: this powder is of a slightlycorrosive nature, and is employed also for the purpose ofchecking the perspiration. A thing that is still more re-<pb n="3331" />markable, this oil is possessed of a certain vinous flavour,being, at the same time, of an unctuous nature, and remarkablyefficacious for improving<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> wines. When this is done, thewine strainer<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> is dipped in the oil before it is used, the resultof which is that it retains the lees of the wine, and allowsnothing but the pure liquor to escape, while at the same timeit accompanies the wine and causes a marked improvement inits flavour.</p><p>Sprigs of myrtle, if carried by a person when travelling onfoot, are found to be very refreshing<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> on a long journey.Rings, too, made of myrtle which has never been touched byiron, are an excellent specific for swellings in the groin.<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">De Re Rust. c. 8,</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The so-called wild myrtle does not in reality belong to the genusMyrtus.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxiii. c. 83; the Ruscus aculeatus of the family of the Asparagea.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The common myrtle, Myrtus communis of the naturalists.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or Roman myrtle, a variety of the Myrtus communis.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The "six row" myrtle.
