<div2 type="chapter" n="26" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 26.—ARTIFICIAL WINES.</head><p>Among the artificial wines, the preparation of which wehave<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> described, [there are some which],<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> I think, are nolonger made; in addition to which, it would be a mere loss oftime to enlarge upon their medicinal effects, having expatiated elsewhere upon the properties of the various elements ofwhich they are composed. And then, besides, the conceits ofthe medical men in relation to these wines have really passedall bounds; they pretend, for instance, that a wine extracted<pb n="4478" />from turnips<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> is good for recruiting the exhausted strength,after exercises in arms or on horseback; and, not to speak ofother preparations, they attribute a similar effect to wine ofjuniper.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> Who is there, too, that would think of lookingupon wormwood wine<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> as superior in its effects to wormwooditself?</p><p>I shall pass in silence the rest of these preparations, andamong them palm wine,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> which is injurious to the head, andis beneficial only as a laxative to the bowels, and as a cure forspitting of blood. We cannot, however, look upon the liquorwhich we have spoken of<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> under the name of "bion," as beingan artificial wine; for the whole art of making it consists merelyin the employment of grapes before they have arrived at maturity. This preparation is extremely good for a derangedstomach or an imperfect digestion, as also for pregnancy, fainting fits, paralysis, fits of trembling, vertigo, gripings of thebowels, and sciatica. It is said, too, that in times of pestilence, and for persons on a long journey, this liquid forms abeverage of remarkable efficacy.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. xiv. cc. 18, 19, 20.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In accordance with the suggestion of Sillig, we insert "sunt quæ,"otherwise the passage is defective.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This would be a vigorous liquor, Fée thinks, and a good tonic;similar, in fact, to the modern antiscorbutie wines.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Fée queries whether this was made from the fermented berries, orfrom an infusion of them in wine.
