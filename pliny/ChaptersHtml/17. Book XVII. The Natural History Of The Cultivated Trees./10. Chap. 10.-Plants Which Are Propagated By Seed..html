Indeed, there are some trees that arecapable of being propagated in no other way, the chesnut<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>and the walnut, for instance; with the sole exception, of course,of such as are employed for coppice wood. By this method,too, as well as the others, some trees are propagated, thoughfrom a seed of a different nature, such, for instance, as thevine, the apple, and the pear;<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> the seed being in all thesecases in the shape of a pip, and not the fruit itself, as in that ofthe chesnut and the walnut. The medlar, too, can also bepropagated by the agency of seed. All trees, however, that aregrown by this method are very slow in coming to maturity,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>degenerate<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> very rapidly, and must often be renewed by grafting: indeed, the chesnut even sometimes requires to be grafted.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Virgil says, Georgics ii. 14:"Pars autem posito surgunt de semine; ut altæ<lb />Castaneæ nemorumque Jovi quæ maxime frondet."<lb /></p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This method of reproduction is seldom or never employed; plants orcuttings only being used for the purpose.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Besides which, it is doubtful if they will reproduce the variety, theseed of which was originally sown.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In some cases, they are more particularly liable to disease—the apple,for instance.</p></body>
