<div2 type="chapter" n="4" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 4.—THE REGION OF THEMISCYRA, AND THE NATIONS THEREIN.</head><p>The river Iris brings down to the sea the waters of theLycus. In the interior is the city of Ziela,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> famous for thedefeat of Triarius<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and the victory of C. Cæsar.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> Upon thecoast there is the river Thermodon, which rises at the fortifiedplace called Phanarœa,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and flows past the foot of MountAmazonius.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> There was formerly a town of the same nameas the river, and five others in all, Amazonium, Themiseyra,Sotira, Amasia, and Comana,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> now only a Manteium. (4.) Wefind here the nations of the Genetæ,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> the Chalybes,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> the townof Cotyorum,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> the nations of the Tibareni and the Mossyni,who make marks upon their bodies,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> the people called Macro-<pb n="2009" />cephali,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> the town of Cerasus,<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> the port of Chordule, thenations called the Bechires<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> and the Buzeri, the river Melas,<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>the people called the Macrones, and Sidene with its riverSidenus,<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> by which the town of Polemonium<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> is washed, at adistance from Amisus of one hundred and twenty miles. Wenext come to the rivers Iasonius<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span>on the site of the older city of Side, at the mouth of the Sidenus and Melanthius,<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> and at adistance of eighty miles from Amisus, the town of Pharnacea,<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span>the fortress and river of Tripolis;<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> the fortress and river ofPhilocalia, the fortress of Liviopolis, but not upon a river, andat a distance of one hundred miles from Pharnacea, the freecity of Trapezus,<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> shut in by a mountain of vast size. Beyond this town is the nation of the Armenochalybes<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> and the<pb n="2010" />Greater Armenia, at a distance of thirty miles. On the coast,before Trapezus, flows the river Pyxites, and beyond it is thenation of the Sanni<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span> Heniochi. Next comes the river Absarus,<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span> with a fortress of the same name at its mouth, distantfrom Trapezus one hundred and forty miles.</p><p>At the back of the mountains of this district is Iberia,while on the coast are the Heniochi, the Ampreutæ,<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span> the Lazi,the rivers Acampsis,<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span> Isis,<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span> Mogrus, and Bathys,<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span> the nationsof the Colchi, the town of Matium,<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span> the river Heracleum andthe promontory of the same name,<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span> and the Phasis,<span id="ref_31"><a href="#note_31">[31]</a></span> the mostcelebrated river of Pontus. This river rises among the Moschi,and is navigable for the largest vessels a distance of thirty-eightmiles and a half, and for small ones very much higher up;it is crossed by one hundred and twenty bridges. It formerlyhad many cities of note on its banks, the more famous ofwhich were Tyndaris, Circæum, Cygnus, and Phasis<span id="ref_32"><a href="#note_32">[32]</a></span> at itsmouth. But the most celebrated of them all was Æa, fifteenmiles<span id="ref_33"><a href="#note_33">[33]</a></span> distant from the sea, where the Hippos and the Cyaneos,<span id="ref_34"><a href="#note_34">[34]</a></span> rivers of vast size, flow into it from opposite directions.At the present day its only place of note is Surium, which<pb n="2011" />derives its name from the river which flows at that spot intothe Phasis, and up to which place the Phasis is navigable forlarge vessels, as we have already<span id="ref_35"><a href="#note_35">[35]</a></span> mentioned. It receives alsosome other rivers, wonderful for their number and magnitude,and among them the Glaucus.<span id="ref_36"><a href="#note_36">[36]</a></span> At the mouth of the Phasis,at a distance of seventy miles from Absarus, are some islands,which, however, have no name. After passing this, we cometo another river, the Charieis,<span id="ref_37"><a href="#note_37">[37]</a></span> and the nation of the Salæ,by the ancients called Phthirophagi,<span id="ref_38"><a href="#note_38">[38]</a></span> as also Suani.<span id="ref_39"><a href="#note_39">[39]</a></span> Theriver Chobus<span id="ref_40"><a href="#note_40">[40]</a></span> flows from the Caucasus through the country ofthe Suani. The river Rhoas comes next, then the region ofEcrectice, the rivers Singames,<span id="ref_41"><a href="#note_41">[41]</a></span> Tarsuras,<span id="ref_42"><a href="#note_42">[42]</a></span> Astelephus,<span id="ref_43"><a href="#note_43">[43]</a></span> Chrysorrhoas, the nation of the Absilæ, the castle of Sebastopolis,<span id="ref_44"><a href="#note_44">[44]</a></span>one hundred miles distant from Phasis, the nation of the Sannigæ, the town of Cygnus,<span id="ref_45"><a href="#note_45">[45]</a></span> and the river and town of Penius.<span id="ref_46"><a href="#note_46">[46]</a></span>We then come to the tribes of the Heniochi,<span id="ref_47"><a href="#note_47">[47]</a></span> who are distinguished by numerous names.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The same place apparently as is mentioned in the last Chapter under the name of Zela.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Valerius Triarius, one of the legates of Lucullus, in the war against Mithridates. Plutarch tells us that Lucullus was obliged to conceal Triarius from the fury of his troops.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Over Pharnaces, the son of Mithridates.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called the Thermea.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Still called Mason-Dagh.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He alludes to Comana, in Pontus, the site of which is now called Gumenek, near to which, on the Tocat-su, the modern name of the Iris, Hamilton found some remains of a Roman town, and part of a bridge apparently of Roman construction. The language of Pliny seems to imply that it had become in his day nothing beyond a <hi rend="ital">manteium</hi> or seat of anoracle.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Strabo speaks of a promontory called Genetes; and Stephanus Byzantinus mentions a river and port of the same name.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Strabo places the Chaldei, who, he says, were originally called Chalybes, in that part of the country which lies above Pharnacia (the modern Kerasunt).</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or Cotyora. According to Xenophon, this was a colony of Sinope, which furnished supplies for the Ten Thousand in their retreat. The place was on a bay called after the town. Hamilton, in his <hi rend="ital">Researches,</hi> &amp;c., Vol. i., is of opinion that Cotyorum may have stood on the site of Ordou, where some remains of an ancient port, cut out of the solid rock, are still visible. He remarks, however, that some writers suppose that Cotvora was the modern bay of Pershembah, which is more sheltered than Ordou. Cotyora was the place of embarkation of the Ten Thousand.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Similar to what we call tatooing. Parisot suggests that these people may have been the ancestors of the Mongol tribes who still dwell in tents similar to those mentioned by Mela as used by the Mossyni.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or the "long-headed people."</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Its site is not improbably that of the modern Kheresoun, on the coastof Asia Minor, and west of Trebizond. Lucullus is said to have broughtthence the first cherry-trees planted in Europe.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It has been remarked, that Pliny's enumeration of names often rather confuses than helps, and that it is difficult to say where he intends to place the Bechires. We may perhaps infer from Mela that they were west of Trapezus and east of the Thermodon.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now the Kara Su, or Black River, still retaining its ancient appellation. It rises in Cappadocia, in the chain of Mount Argæus.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Still called by the same name, according to Parisot, though sometimes it is called the river of Vatisa. More recent authorities, however,call it Poleman Chai.</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">On the coast of Pontus, built by king Polémon, perhaps the Second,</p><p><span id="note_17"><a href="#ref_17">17. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably near the promontory of Jasonium, 130 stadia to the northeast of Polemonium. It was believed to have received its name fromJason the Argonaut having landed there. It still bears the name ofJasoon, though more commonly called Bona or Vona.</p><p><span id="note_18"><a href="#ref_18">18. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Sixty stadia, according to arrian, from the town of cotyora</p><p><span id="note_19"><a href="#ref_19">19. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Supposed to have stood on almost the same site as the modern Kheresoun or Kerasunda. It was built near, or, as some think, on the site of Cerasus.</p><p><span id="note_20"><a href="#ref_20">20. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Still known by the name of Tireboli, on a river of the same name, the Tireboli Su.</p><p><span id="note_21"><a href="#ref_21">21. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called Tarabosan, Trabezun, or Trebizond. This place was originally a colony of Sinope, after the loss of whose independence Trapezus belonged, first to Lesser Armenia, and afterwards to the kingdom of Pontus. In the middle ages it was the seat of the so-called empire of Trebizond. It is now the second commercial port of the Black Sea, ranking next after Odessa.</p><p><span id="note_22"><a href="#ref_22">22. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The "Chalybes of Armenia." See p. 21.</p><p><span id="note_23"><a href="#ref_23">23. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Theodoret says that the Sanni, and the Lazi, subsequently mentioned, although subdued by the Roman arms, were never obedient to the Roman laws. The Heniochi were probably of Grecian origin, as they were said to have been descended from the charioteers of the Argonauts, who had been wrecked upon these coasts.</p><p><span id="note_24"><a href="#ref_24">24. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or Apsarus, or Absarum. Several geographers have placed the site of this town near the modern one known as Gonieh. Its name was connected with the myth of Medea and her brother Absyrtus. It is not improbable that the names Acampsis and Absarus have been given to the same river by different writers, and that they both apply to the modern Joruk.</p><p><span id="note_25"><a href="#ref_25">25. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is suggested by Hardouin that these are the same as the Zydretæ mentioned in the Periplus of Arrian, and by him placed between the Heniochi and the Lazi.</p><p><span id="note_26"><a href="#ref_26">26. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See note 91.</p><p><span id="note_27"><a href="#ref_27">27. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Supposed to be the same as the modem Tshorok.</p><p><span id="note_28"><a href="#ref_28">28. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "Deep" River. This stream may possibly be identified by observing that Pliny places only one river between it and the Phasis.</p><p><span id="note_29"><a href="#ref_29">29. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably the Madia of Ptolemy, who places it in the interior.</p><p><span id="note_30"><a href="#ref_30">30. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">At the present day called Eraklia, according to Parisot.</p><p><span id="note_31"><a href="#ref_31">31. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called the Faz or Poti.</p><p><span id="note_32"><a href="#ref_32">32. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Still called El Faz or Poti.</p><p><span id="note_33"><a href="#ref_33">33. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This place was in reality thirty-seven miles and a half from the sea. It was said to have been the native place of the enchantresses Circe and Medea.</p><p><span id="note_34"><a href="#ref_34">34. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The rivers Hippos and Cyaneos do not appear to have been identified.</p><p><span id="note_35"><a href="#ref_35">35. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In the previous page.</p><p><span id="note_36"><a href="#ref_36">36. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called the Tehorocsu.</p><p><span id="note_37"><a href="#ref_37">37. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is doubtful whether this is the same river as that mentioned by Strabo under the name of Chares. D'Anville says that its modern name is Enguri.</p><p><span id="note_38"><a href="#ref_38">38. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "Feeders on Lice;" so called, according to Strabo, from the extreme filthiness of their habits.</p><p><span id="note_39"><a href="#ref_39">39. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There is a nation in this vicinity still called by a similar name. Professor Pallas, who visited them, says that nothing can equal their dishonesty,rapacity, and voracity. Parisot suggests that they are probably thedescendants of the Phthirophagi of Pliny.</p><p><span id="note_40"><a href="#ref_40">40. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called the Khalira, according to D'Anville.</p><p><span id="note_41"><a href="#ref_41">41. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called the Hati-Scari, according to D'Anville.</p><p><span id="note_42"><a href="#ref_42">42. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now the Okhum, according to D'Anville.</p><p><span id="note_43"><a href="#ref_43">43. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now the Mosti-Skari, according to D'Anville.</p><p><span id="note_44"><a href="#ref_44">44. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Still called Savastopoli, according to Hardouin.</p><p><span id="note_45"><a href="#ref_45">45. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This must not be confounded with the other place of the same namementioned in the present Chapter. See p. 10.</p><p><span id="note_46"><a href="#ref_46">46. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hermoläus suggests Pityus as the correct reading.</p><p><span id="note_47"><a href="#ref_47">47. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Sanni Heniochi; one of these nations has been already mentioned in the last page.</p></body>
