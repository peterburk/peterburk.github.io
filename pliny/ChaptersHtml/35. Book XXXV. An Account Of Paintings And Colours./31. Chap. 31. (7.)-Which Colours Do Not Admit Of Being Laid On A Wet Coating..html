(7.)—WHICH COLOURS DO NOT ADMIT OF BEINGLAID ON A WET COATING.</head><p>Those among the colours which require a dry, cretaceous,coating,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and refuse to adhere to a wet surface, are purpurissum,indicum, cæruleum,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> melinum, orpiment, appianum, andceruse. Wax, too, is stained with all these colouring substancesfor encaustic painting;<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> a process which does not admit of<pb n="6245" />being applied to walls, but is in common use<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> by way of ornamentfor ships of war, and, indeed, merchant-ships at the presentday. As we go so far as to paint these vehicles of danger, noone can be surprised if we paint our funeral piles as well, orif we have our gladiators conveyed in handsome carriages tothe scene of death, or, at all events, of carnage. When weonly contemplate this extensive variety of colours, we cannotbut admire the ingenuity displayed by the men of formerdays.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Cretulam."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxxiii. c. 57.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See Chapter 39, where this process is more fully described. "'<hi rend="ital">Cerœ,</hi>'or 'waxes,' was the ordinary term for painters' colours among the Romans,but more especially encaustic colours, which were probably kept dryin boxes, and the wet brush or pencil was rubbed upon them when colourwas required, or they were moistened by the artist previous to commencingwork. From the term 'ceræ' it would appear that wax constituted theprincipal ingredient in the colouring vehicle used; but this does not necessarilyfollow, and it is very improbable that it did; there must havebeen a great portion of gum or resin in the colours, or they could not havehardened. Wax was undoubtedly a most essential ingredient, since itapparently prevents the colours from cracking. 'Ceræ' therefore mightoriginally simply mean colours which contained wax, in contradistinctionto those which did not; but was afterwards applied generally by the Romansto the colours of painters."—Wornum, Smith's Diet.
