<div2 type="chapter" n="3" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 3. (4.)ÑTHE BODIES OF INSECTS.</head><p>Insects, so far as I find myself able to ascertain, seem tohave neither sinews,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> bones, spines, cartilages, fat, nor flesh;nor yet so much as a frail shell, like some of the marine animals, nor even anything that can with any propriety betermed skin; but they have a body which is of a kind of intermediate nature between all these, of an arid substance, softerthan muscle, and in other respects of a nature that may, instrictness, be rather pronounced yielding,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> than hard. Such,then, is all that they are, and nothing more:<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> in the insideof their bodies there is nothing, except in some few, whichhave an intestine arranged in folds. Hence it is, that evenwhen cut asunder, they are remarkable for their tenacity oflife, and the palpitations which are to be seen in each of theirparts. For every portion of them is possessed of its ownvital principle, which is centred in no limb in particular, but<pb n="3005" />in every part of the body; least of all, however, in the head,which alone is subject to no movements unless torn off togetherwith the corselet. No kind of animal has more feet than theinsects have, and those among them which have the most, livethe longest when cut asunder, as we see in the case of the scolopendra. They have eyes, and the senses as well of touch andtaste; some of them have also the sense of smelling, and somefew that of hearing.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">" Nervos."
