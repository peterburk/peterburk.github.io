(53.)ÑRESPIRATION AND NUTRIMENT.</head><p>The breath of the lion is fetid, and that of the bear quitepestilential; indeed, no beast will touch anything with whichits breath has come in contact, and substances which it hasbreathed upon will become putrid sooner than others. It isin man only that Nature has willed that the breath shouldbecome tainted in several ways, either through faultiness inthe victuals or the teeth, or else, as is more generally the case,through extreme old age. Our breath in itself was insensibleto all pain, utterly devoid as it was of all powers of touch andfeeling, without which there can be no sensation; ever renewed, it was always forthcoming, destined to be the last adjunct that shall leave the body, and the only one to remainwhen all is gone beside; it drew, in fine, its origin fromheaven. In spite of all this, however, certain penalties werediscovered to be inflicted upon it, so that the very substanceby the aid of which we live might become a torment to us inlife. This inconvenience is more particularly experiencedamong the Parthians, from their youth upwards, on accountof the indiscriminate use of food among them; and, indeed,their very excess in wine causes their breath to be fetid. Thegrandees, however, of that nation have a remedy for bad breathin the pips of the Assyrian citron,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> which they mix with theirfood, and the aroma of which is particularly agreeable. Thebreath of the elephant will attract serpents from their holes,while that of the stag scorches them. We have already mademention<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> of certain races of men who could by suction extractfrom the body the venom of serpents; and swine will even eatserpents,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> which to other animals are poisonous. All thosecreatures which we have spoken of as insects, can be killed bymerely sprinkling them with oil.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> Vultures, which are putto flight by unguents, are attracted by other odours: the beetle,too, is attracted by the rose. The scorpion puts to death certainserpents. The Scythians dip their arrows in the poison of<pb n="3098" />serpents and human blood: against this frightful compositionthere is no remedy, for with the slightest touch it is productiveof instant death.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xii. c. 7.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">B. vii. c. 2.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxix. c. 23.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See c. 21 of the present Book.</p></body>
