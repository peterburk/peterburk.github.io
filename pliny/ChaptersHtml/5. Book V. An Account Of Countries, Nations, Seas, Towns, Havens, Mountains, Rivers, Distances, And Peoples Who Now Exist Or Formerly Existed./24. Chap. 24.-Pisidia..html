On the south-east it was bounded by Cilicia, on the east and north-east by Lycaonia and Isauria, and by Phrygia Parorios on the north, where its boundaries greatly varied at different times.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Generally called "Antioch of Pisidia," was situate on the south side of the mountain boundary between Phrygia and Pisidia. The modern Yalobatch is supposed to occupy its site. The remains of the ancient town are numerous. Its title of C¾sarea was probably given to it on its becoming a Roman colony early in the imperial period.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">D'Anville suggests that the modern Haviran occupies its site, and that Sadjakla stands on that of Sagalessos.</p></body>
