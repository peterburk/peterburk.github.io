<div2 type="chapter" n="80" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 80.—THE LAUREL; SIXTY-NINE OBSERVATIONS UPON IT.</head><p>All parts of the laurel, both the leaves, bark, and berries,are of a warming<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> nature; and a decoction of them, theleaves in particular, is very useful for affections of the bladder and uterus.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> The leaves, applied topically, neutralize thepoison of wasps, bees, and hornets, as also that of serpents,the seps,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> dipsas,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and viper, in particular. Boiled in oil,<pb n="4517" />they promote the catamenia; and the more tender of the leavesbeaten up with polenta, are used for inflammations of the eyes.with rue for inflammations of the testes, and with rose-oil, oroil of iris,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> for head-ache. Three leaves, chewed and swallowed for three days in succession, are a cure for cough, andbeaten up with honey, for asthma. The bark of the root isdangerous to pregnant women; the root itself disperses calculi, and taken in doses of three oboli in aromatic wine, itacts beneficially on the liver. The leaves, taken in drink, actas an emetic;<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> and the berries, pounded and applied as a pessary, or else taken in drink, promote menstruation. Two ofthe berries with the skin removed, taken in wine, are a curefor inveterate cough and hardness of breathing; if, however,this is accompanied with fever, they are given in water, orelse in an electuary with raisin wine, or boiled in hydromel.Employed in a similar manner, they are good for phthisis, andfor all defluxions of the chest, as they have the effect ofdetaching the phlegm and bringing it off.</p><p>For stings inflicted by scorpions, four laurel-berries aretaken in wine. Applied with oil, they are a cure for epinyctis, freckles, running sores, ulcers of the mouth, and scalyeruptions. The juice of the berries is curative of porrigoand phthiriasis; and for pains in the ears, or hardness of hearing, it is injected into those organs with old wine and oil ofroses. All venomous creatures fly at the approach of personswho have been anointed with this juice: taken in drink, thejuice of the small-leaved<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> laurel in particular, it is good forstings inflicted by them. The berries,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> used with wine, neu-tralize the venom of serpents, scorpions, and spiders; theyare applied also, topically, with oil and vinegar, in diseases ofthe spleen and liver, and with honey to gangrenous sores. Incases of lassitude and shivering fits, it is a very good plan torub the body with juice of laurel-berries mixed with nitre.Some persons are of opinion that delivery is accelerated bytaking laurel-root to the amount of one acetabulum, in water,and that, used fresh, it is better than dried. It is recommended<pb n="4518" />by some authorities, to take ten of the berries in drink, forthe sting of the scorpion; and in cases of relaxation of theuvula, to boil a quarter of a pound of the berries, or leaves,in three sextarii of water, down to one third, the decoctionbeing used warm, as a gargle. For head-ache, also, it is recommended to bruise an uneven number of the berries in oil,the mixture being warmed for use.</p><p>The leaves of the Delphic laurel<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> bruised and applied to thenostrils from time to time, are a preservative<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> against conta-gion in pestilence, and more particularly if they are burnt.The oil of the<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> Delphic laurel is employed in the preparationof cerates and the medicinal composition known as "acopum,"<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>and is used for fits of shivering occasioned by cold, for therelaxation of the sinews, and for the cure of pains in the sideand the cold attacks in fevers.<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> Warmed in the rind of apomegranate, it is applied topically for the cure of ear-ache. Adecoction of the leaves boiled down in water to one third, usedas a gargle, braces the uvula, and taken in drink allays painsin the bowels and intestines. The more tender leaves, bruisedin wine and applied at night, are a cure for pimples andprurigo.</p><p>The other varieties of the laurel possess properties whichare nearly analogous. The root of the laurel of Alexandria,<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>or of Mount Ida,<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> accelerates delivery, being administered indoses of three denarii to three cyathi of sweet wine; it actsalso as an emmenagogue, and brings away the after-birth.Taken in drink in a similar manner, the wild laurel, known as"daphnoides" and by the other names which we have mentioned,<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> is productive of beneficial effects. The leaves of it,either fresh or dried, taken in doses of three drachmœ, inhydromel with salt, act as a purgative<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> upon the bowels.<pb n="4519" />The wood, chewed, brings off phlegm, and the leaves act asan "emetic;" they are unwholesome, however, to the stomach.The berries, too, are sometimes taken, fifteen in number, as apurgative.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">All parts of the laurel, the berries in particular, are impregnated withan essential oil with a powerful odour and of an exciting nature.
