<div2 type="chapter" n="10" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 10.ÑWHAT PICTURES THE EMPERORS HAVE EXHIBITEDIN PUBLIC.</head><p>The late Emperor Augustus did more than all the others;for he placed in the most conspicuous part of his Forum, twopictures, representing War and Triumph.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> He also placed inthe Temple of his father,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> C¾sar, a picture of the Castors,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>and one of Victory, in addition to those which we shall mentionin our account of the works of the different artists.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> Healso inserted two pictures in the wall of the Curia<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> whichhe consecrated in the Comitium;<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> one of which was a Nemea<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>seated upon a lion, and bearing a palm in her hand. Close to<pb n="6234" />her is an Old Man, standing with a staff, and above his headhangs the picture of a chariot with two horses. Nicias<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> haswritten upon this picture that he "inburned"<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> it, such beingthe word he has employed.</p><p>In the second picture the thing to be chiefly admired, is theresemblance that the youth bears to the old man his father,allowing, of course, for the difference in age; above them soarsan eagle, which grasps a dragon in its talons. Philochares<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>attests that he is the author of this work, an instance, if weonly consider it, of the mighty power wielded by the pictorialart; for here, thanks to Philochares, the senate of the Romanpeople, age after age, has before its eyes Glaucion and his sonAristippus, persons who would otherwise have been altogetherunknown. The Emperor Tiberius, too, a prince who was byno means very gracious, has exhibited in the temple dedicatedby him, in his turn, to Augustus, several pictures whichwe shall describe hereafter.<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">According to Hardouin, this was done after the battle of Actium, inwhich Augustus subdued his rival Antony.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">By adoption.
