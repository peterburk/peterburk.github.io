(87.)—WHAT ISLANDS HAVE BEEN FORMED, ANDAT WHAT PERIODS.</head><p>Delos and Rhodes<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>, islands which have now been longfamous, are recorded to have risen up in this way. Morelately there have been some smaller islands formed; Anapha,which is beyond Melos; Nea, between Lemnos and theHellespont; Halone, between Lebedos and Teos; Thera<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> andTherasia, among the Cyclades, in the fourth year of the135th Olympiad<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>. And among the same islands, 130 yearsafterwards, Hiera, also called Automate<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, made its appearance; alsoThia, at the distance of two stadia from theformer, 110 years afterwards, in our own times, when M.Junius Silanus and L. Balbus were consuls, on the 8th ofthe ides of July<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>.</p><p>(88.) Opposite to us, and near to Italy, among the Æolianisles, an island emerged from the sea; and likewise one nearCrete, 2500 paces in extent, and with warm springs in it;another made its appearance in the third year of the 163rdOlympiad<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>, in the Tuscan gulf, burning with a violentexplosion. There is a tradition too that a great number offishes were floating about the spot, and that those who employed them for food immediately expired. It is said thatthe Pithecusan isles rose up, in the same way, in the bayof Campania, and that, shortly afterwards, the mountainEpopos, from which flame had suddenly burst forth, wasreduced to the level of the neighbouring plain. In the sameisland, it is said, that a town was sunk in the sea; that in<pb n="1119" />consequence of another shock, a lake burst out, and that, bya third, Prochytas was formed into an island, the neighbouring mountains being rolled away from it.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It may be remarked, that the accounts of modern travellers andgeologists tend to confirm the opinion of the volcanic origin of many ofthe islands of the Archipelago.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Brotier remarks, that, according to the account of Herodotus, thisisland existed previous to the date here assigned to it; Lemaire, i. 412,413: it is probable, however, that the same name was applied to twoislands, one at least of which was of volcanic origin.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">U.C. 517, A.C. <date value="237" authname="237">237</date>; and U.C. 617,A.C. <date value="107" authname="107">107</date>; respectively.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hiera, Automata; ab <foreign lang="greek">i(era\,</foreign> sacer, et <foreign lang="greek">au)toma/th,</foreign>sponte nascens.Respecting the origin of these islands there would appear to be someconfusion in the dates, which it is difficult to reconcile with each other;it is, I conceive, impossible to decide whether this depends upon an errorof our author himself, or of his transcribers.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">July 25th, U.C. 771; A.C. <date value="19" authname="19">19</date>.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">U.C. 628; A.C. <date value="125" authname="125">125</date>.</p></body>
