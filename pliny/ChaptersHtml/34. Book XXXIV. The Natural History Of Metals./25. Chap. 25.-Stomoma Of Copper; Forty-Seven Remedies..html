For this longtime past, they have even purchased their plasters and eye-salvesready made, and the consequence is, that the spoiled oradulterated wares in the druggists' shops are thus got rid of.</p><p>Both lepis and flower of copper are calcined in shallowearthen or brazen pans; after which they are washed, asdescribed above,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and employed for the same purposes; in additionto which, they are used for excrescences in the nostrils andin the anus, as also for dullness of the hearing, being forciblyblown into the ears through a tube. Incorporated with meal,they are applied to swellings of the uvula, and, with honey, toswellings of the tonsils. The scales prepared from whitecopper are much less efficacious than those from Cypriancopper. Sometimes they first macerate the nails and cakes ofcopper in a boy's urine; and in some instances, they poundthe scales, when detached, and wash them in rain water.They are then given to dropsical patients, in doses of twodrachm¾, with one semisextarius of honied wine: they are alsomade into a liniment with fine flour.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ajasson describes this substance as consisting merely of the pure metalin a state of minute mechanical division; it would appear, therefore, to bescarcely, if at all, different from the articles described in the last Chapter.The word <foreign lang="greek">Sto/mwma</foreign> means a "hard substance," or "hard scales," thereforethe application of this term to a substance like down, "lanugo," isperhaps not very appropriate.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Beckmann comments at some length on this passage; Vol. I. p. 328.<hi rend="ital">Bohn's Edition.</hi></p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Seplasi¾."
