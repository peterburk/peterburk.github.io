This plant, too, is no less fond of ahumid soil than parsley; it is green in summer and turnsyellow in winter. There is a wild kind of mint, known to usas "mentastrum:"<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> it is reproduced by layers, like the vine,or else by planting the branches upside down. It was thesweetness of its smell that caused this plant to change its nameamong the Greeks, its former name with them being "mintha,"from which the ancient Romans derived their name<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> for it;whereas now, of late, it has been called by them <foreign lang="greek">h(du/osmon.</foreign><span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>The mint that is used in the dishes at rustic entertainmentspervades the tables far and wide with its agreeable odour.When once planted, it lasts a considerable length of time; itbears, too, a strong resemblance to pennyroyal, a property ofwhich is, as mentioned by us more than once,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> to flower whenkept in our larders.</p><p>These other herbs, mint, I mean, and catmint, as well aspennyroyal, are all kept for use in a similar manner; but it iscummin<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> that is the best suited of all the seasoning herbs tosqueamish and delicate stomachs. This plant grows on thesurface of the soil, seeming hardly to adhere to it, and raisingitself aloft from the ground: it ought to be sown in the middleof the summer, in a crumbly, warm soil, more particularly.There is another wild kind<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> of cummin, known by some persons as "rustic," by others as "Thebaic" cummin: bruisedand drunk in water, it is good for pains in the stomach. Thecummin most esteemed in our part of the world is that ofCarpetania,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> though elsewhere that of Africa and ®thiopiais more highly esteemed; with some, indeed, this last is pre-ferred to that of Egypt.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xx. c. 53.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Called by the Greeks <foreign lang="greek">kalami/nqh,</foreign> according to Apuleius.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "Mentha."</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Sweet-smelling."</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"S¾pius."
