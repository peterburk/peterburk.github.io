<div2 type="chapter" n="20" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 20. (11.)—NINE KINDS OF GUM. THE SARCOCOLLA.</head><p>It is universally agreed, that the best gum is that producedfrom the Egyptian thorn;<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> it is of variegated appearance, ofazure colour, clean, free from all admixture of bark, andadheres to the teeth; the price at which it sells is threedenarii per pound. That produced from the bitter almond-<pb n="3185" />tree and the cherry<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> is of an inferior kind, and that which isgathered from the plum-tree is the worst of all. The vine,too, produces a gum,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> which is of the greatest utility in healingthe sores of children; while that which is sometimes found onthe olive-tree<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> is used for the tooth-ache. Gum is also foundon the elm<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> upon Mount Corycus in Cilicia, and upon thejuniper,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> but it is good for nothing; indeed, the gum of theelm found there is apt to breed gnats. From the sarcocolla<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>also—such is the name of a certain tree—a gum exudes that isremarkably useful to painters<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> and medical men; it is similarto incense dust in appearance, and for those purposes the whitekind is preferable to the red. The price of it is the same asthat mentioned above.<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Acacia Nilotica of Linnæus, from which we derive the gumArabic of commerce; and of which a considerable portion is still derivedfrom Egypt.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">These gums are chemically different from gum Arabic, and they areused for different purposes in the arts.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The vine does not produce a gum; but when the sap ascends, a juiceis secreted, which sometimes becomes solid on the evaporation of theaqueous particles. This substance contains acetate of potassa, which, bythe decomposition of that salt, becomes a carbonate of the same base.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is not a gum, but a resinous product of a peculiar nature. It isknown to the moderns by the name of "olivine."</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The sap of the eim leaves a saline deposit on the bark, principallyformed of carbonate of potassa. Fée is at a loss to know whether Plinyhere alludes to this or to the manna which is incidentally formed by certaininsects on some trees and reeds. But, as he justly says, would Pliny sayof the latter that it is "ad nihil utile"—"good for nothing"?</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A resinous product, no doubt. The frankincense of Africa has beenattributed by some to the Juniperus Lycia and Phoenicia.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Penæa Sarcocolla of Linnæus. The gum resin of this tree isstill brought from Abyssinia, but it is not used in medicine. This accountis from is Dioscorides, B. iii. c. 99. The name is from the Greek <foreign lang="greek">sarc,</foreign>"flesh," and <foreign lang="greek">ko/lla,</foreign> "glue."</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxiv. c. 7.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Three denarii per pound.</p></body>
