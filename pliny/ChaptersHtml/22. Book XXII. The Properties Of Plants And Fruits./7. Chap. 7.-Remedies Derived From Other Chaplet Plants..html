All this, however, is but little knownamong us at the present day; a fact which I am the less surprised at, when I reflect that those plants even are treatedwith the same indifference, the purpose of which it is to preserve our health, to allay our bodily pains, and to repel theadvances of death! And who is there that would not visitwith censure, and justly visit, the manners of the present day?Luxury and effeminacy have augmented the price at whichwe live, and never was life more hankered after, or worsecared<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> for, than it is at present. This, however, we look uponas the business of others, forsooth; other persons must see to it,without our troubling ourselves to request them, and the physicians must exercise the necessary providence in our behalves.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>As for ourselves, we go on enjoying our pleasures, and are con-tent to live—a thing that in my opinion reflects the highestpossible disgrace—by putting faith in others.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span></p><p>Nay, even more than this, we ourselves are held in derisionby many, for undertaking these researches, and are chargedwith busying ourselves with mere frivolities! It is somesolace, however, in the prosecution of these our boundlesslabours, to have Nature as our sharer in this contempt: Nature who, as we will prove beyond a doubt, has never failedin coming to the assistance of man, and has implanted<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> reme-<pb n="4396" />dies for our use in the most despised even of the vegetable productions, medicaments in plants which repel us with theirthorns.</p><p>It is of these, in fact, that it remains for us now to speak, asnext in succession to those which we have mentioned in thepreceding Book; and here we cannot sufficiently admire, and,indeed, adore,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> the wondrous providence displayed by Nature.She had given us, as already<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> shewn, plants soft to the touch,and agreeable to the palate; in the flowers she had paintedthe remedies for our diseases with her varied tints, and, whilecommingling the useful with the delicious, had attracted ourattention by means of the pleasures of the eye. Here, how-ever, she has devised another class of plants, bristling and repulsive to the sight, and dangerous to the touch; so much so,indeed, that we fancy we all but hear the voice of her whomade them as she reveals to us her motives for so doing. It isher wish, she says, that no ravening cattle may browse uponthem, that no wanton hand may tear them up, that no heedless footstep may tread them down, that no bird, perching there,may break them: and in thus fortifying them with thorns, andarming them with weapons, it has been her grand objectto save and protect the remedies which they afford to man.Thus we see, the very qualities even which we hold in suchaversion, have been devised by Nature for the benefit and advantage of mankind.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hence we may conclude that the word "gramen" signified not only"grass," but any plant in general.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">By reason of the luxury and sensuality universally prevalent.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is said in bitter irony.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Trusting to the good faith and research of the physician.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Inseruisse."</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Amplecti."</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In the Twentieth Book.</p></body>
