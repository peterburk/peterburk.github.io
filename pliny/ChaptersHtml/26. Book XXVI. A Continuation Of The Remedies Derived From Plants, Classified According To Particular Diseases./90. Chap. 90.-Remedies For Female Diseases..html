<div2 type="chapter" n="90" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 90.—REMEDIES FOR FEMALE DISEASES.</head><p>One great remedy for all female diseases in common, is theblack seed of the herbaceous plant pæonia,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> taken in hydro-mel: the root also is an effectual emmenagogue. Seed ofpanaces,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> mixed with wormwood, acts as an emmenagogue andas a sudorific: the same, too, with scordotis,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> taken internallyor applied topically. Betony, in doses of one drachma tothree cyathi of wine, is taken for various affections of theuterus, as also directly after child-birth. Excessive menstruation is arrested by a pessary of achillea,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> or else a sitting-bathcomposed of a decoction of that plant. Seed of henbane inwine is used as a liniment for diseases of the mamillæ,and the root is employed in the form of a plaster for uterineaffections; chelidonia,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> too, is applied to the mamillæ.</p><p>Roots of panaces,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> applied as a pessary, bring away theafter-birth and the dead fœtus, and the plant itself, taken inwine, or used as a pessary with honey, acts as a detergentupon the uterus. Polemonia,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> taken in wine, brings away theafter-birth; used as a fumigation, it is good for suffocations ofthe uterus. Juice of the smaller centaury,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> taken in drink, oremployed as a fomentation, acts as an emmenagogue. The rootalso of the larger centaury, similarly used, is good for pains inthe uterus; scraped and used as a pessary, it expels thedead fœtus. For pains of the uterus, plantago<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> is applied asa pessary, in wool, and for hysterical suffocations, it is taken in<pb n="5211" />drink. But it is dittany that is of the greatest efficacy in casesof this description; it acts as an emmenagogue, and is an expellent of the fœtus when dead or lying transversely in theuterus. In these cases the leaves of it are taken, in doses ofone obolus, in water: indeed so active is it in its effects thatordinarily it is forbidden to be introduced into the chamber ofa woman lying-in. Not only is it thus efficacious when takenin drink, but even when applied topically or used as a fumiga-tion. Pseudodictamnum<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> possesses pretty nearly the same virtues, but it acts as an emmenagogue also, boiled in doses of onedenarius in unmixed wine. Aristolochia,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> however, is employedfor a greater number of purposes: in combination with myrrhand pepper, either taken in drink or used as a pessary, it actsas a powerful emmenagogue, and brings away the dead fœtusand the after-birth. This plant, the smaller kind in particular,used either as a fomentation, fumigation, or pessary, acts as apreventive of procidence of the uterus.</p><p>Hysterical suffocations and irregularities of the catameniaare treated with agaric, taken in doses of three oboli, in onecyathus of old wine: vervain is used also in similar cases, as apessary, with fresh hog's lard; or else antirrhinum,<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> with roseoil and honey. Root of Thessalian nymphæa,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> used as apessary, is curative of pains in the uterus; taken in red wine,it arrests uterine discharges. Root of cyclaminos,<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> on theother hand, taken in drink and employed as a pessary, acts asan emmenagogue: a decoction of it, used as a sitting-bath,cures affections of the bladder. Cissanthemos,<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> taken in drink,brings away the after-birth, and is curative of diseases of the.uterus. The upper part of the root of xiphion,<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> taken indoses of one drachma, in vinegar, promotes menstruation. Afumigation of burnt peucedanum<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> has a soothing effect incases of hysterical suffocation. Psyllion,<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> taken in the proportion of one drachma to three cyathi of hydromel, is particularly good for promoting the lochial discharge. Seed ofmandragora,<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> taken in drink, acts as a detergent upon the<pb n="5212" />uterus; the juice, employed in a pessary, promotes menstruationand expels the dead fetus. The seed of this plant, used withlive sulphur,<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> arrests menstruation when in excess; while batrachion,<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> on the other hand, acts as an emmenagogue. Thislast plant is either used as an article of food, or is taken indrink: in a raw state, as already stated,<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> it has a burningflavour; but when cooked, the taste of it is greatly improved bythe addition of salt, oil, and cummin. Daucus,<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span> taken in drink,promotes the catamenia, and is an expellent of the after-birthin a very high degree. Ladanum,<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span> used as a fumigation, actsas a corrective upon the uterus, and is employed topically forpains and ulcerations of that organ.</p><p>Scammony, taken in drink or used as a pessary, is an expellent of the dead fœtus. Either kind of hypericon,<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span> usedas a pessary, promotes menstruation: but for this purpose itis crethmos,<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span> according to Hippocrates, that is the most efficacious, the seed or root of it being taken in wine.<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span>of the outer coat brings away the after-birth. This plant,taken in water, is good for hysterical suffocations; root ofgeranion<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span> also, which is peculiarly useful for the after-birth,and for inflation of the uterus. Hippuris,<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span> taken in drinkor applied as a pessary, acts as a detergent upon the uterus:polygonos,<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span> taken in drink, promotes menstruation; and thesane with root of alcima.<span id="ref_31"><a href="#note_31">[31]</a></span> Leaves of plantago,<span id="ref_32"><a href="#note_32">[32]</a></span> and agaricin hydromel, have a similar effect. Artemisia,<span id="ref_33"><a href="#note_33">[33]</a></span> bruised andapplied as a pessary, with oil of iris,<span id="ref_34"><a href="#note_34">[34]</a></span> figs, or myrrh, is curativeof diseases of the uterus; the root, too, of this plant, takenin drink, is so strongly purgative as to expel the dead fœtuseven. A decoction of the branches, used as a sitting-bath,promotes menstruation and brings away the after-birth; the<pb n="5213" />same, too, with the leaves, taken in doses of one drachma indrink. The leaves, if applied to the lower regions of theabdomen with barley-meal, will prove equally efficacious.</p><p>Acoron<span id="ref_35"><a href="#note_35">[35]</a></span> is very useful for internal complaints of females;as also the two varieties of conyza,<span id="ref_36"><a href="#note_36">[36]</a></span> and crethmos.<span id="ref_37"><a href="#note_37">[37]</a></span> Eitherkind of anthyllis,<span id="ref_38"><a href="#note_38">[38]</a></span> taken in wine, is remarkably good for uterineaffections, griping pains in that organ, and retardations of theafter-birth. Callithrix,<span id="ref_39"><a href="#note_39">[39]</a></span> applied as a fomentation, is curativeof affections of the vagina: it removes scaly eruptions<span id="ref_40"><a href="#note_40">[40]</a></span> alsoof the head, and, beaten up in oil, it stains the hair. Geranion,<span id="ref_41"><a href="#note_41">[41]</a></span> taken in white wine, or hypocisthis<span id="ref_42"><a href="#note_42">[42]</a></span> in red, arrestsall uterine discharges. Hyssop modifies hysterical suffocations.Root of vervain, taken in water, is a most excellent remedyfor all accidents incident to, or consequent upon, delivery.Some persons mix bruised cypress seed with peucedanum<span id="ref_43"><a href="#note_43">[43]</a></span> inred wine. Seed, too, of psyllion,<span id="ref_44"><a href="#note_44">[44]</a></span> boiled in water and takenwarm, has a soothing effect upon all defluxions of the uterus.Symphyton,<span id="ref_45"><a href="#note_45">[45]</a></span> bruised in wine, promotes menstruation. Juiceof scordotis,<span id="ref_46"><a href="#note_46">[46]</a></span> in the proportion of one drachma to four cyathiof hydromel, accelerates delivery. Leaves of dittany are givenfor the same purpose, in water, with remarkable success. Itis a well-known fact, too, that these leaves, to the extent of asingle obolus even, will bring away the fœtus instantaneously,even when dead, without the slightest inconvenience to thepatient. Pseudodictamnum<span id="ref_47"><a href="#note_47">[47]</a></span> is productive of a somewhatsimilar effect, but not in so marked a degree: cyclaminos,<span id="ref_48"><a href="#note_48">[48]</a></span>too, attached as an amulet; cissanthemos,<span id="ref_49"><a href="#note_49">[49]</a></span> taken in drink;and powdered betony, in hydromel.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxv. c, 10.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxv. c. 11, <hi rend="ital">et seq.</hi></p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxv. c. 27.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxv. c. 19.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxv. c. 50.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxv. c. 11, <hi rend="ital">et seq.</hi></p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxv. c. 28.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxv. c. 31.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxv. c. 39.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Bastard dittany."
