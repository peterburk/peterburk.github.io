The flesh of this last, preserved in salt, is given, indoses of one denarius, in three cyathi of drink to persons whohave been stung by serpents: or else the maw of the animal isstuffed with coriander seed and dried, to be taken for the samepurpose in wine. The young one of the weasel is still moreefficacious for these purposes.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The ferret, most probably.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See c. 33 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The common weasel.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably in his work entitled "Admiranda," now lost.
