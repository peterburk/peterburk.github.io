<div2 type="chapter" n="18" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 18. (16.)—THE MODE OF KEEPING VARIOUS FRUITS ANDGRAPES.</head><p>For the better preserving of fruits it is universally recommended that the storeroom should be situate in a cool, dryspot, with a well-boarded floor, and windows looking towardsthe north; which in fine weather ought to be kept open. Careshould also be taken to keep out the south wind by windowpanes,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> while at the same time it should be borne in mind thata north-east wind will shrivel fruit and make it unsightly. Apples are gathered after the autumnal equinox; but the gathering should never begin before the sixteenth day of the moon,or before the first hour of the day. Windfalls should alwaysbe kept separate, and there ought to be a layer of straw, orelse mats or chaff, placed beneath. They should, also, beplaced apart from each other, in rows, so that the air may circulate freely between them, and they may equally gain thebenefit of it. The Amerinian apple is the best keeper, themelimelum the very worst of all.</p><p>(17.) Quinces ought to be stored in a place kept perfectlyclosed, so as to exclude all draughts; or else they should beboiled in honey<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> or soaked in it. Pomegranates are made<pb n="3304" />hard and firm by being first put in boiling<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> sea-water, andthen left to dry for three days in the sun, care being taken thatthe dews of the night do not touch them; after which theyare hung up, and when wanted for use, washed with freshwater. M. Varro<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> recommends that they should be kept inlarge vessels filled with sand: if they are not ripe, he saysthat they should be put in pots with the bottom broken out,and then buried<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> in the earth, all access to the air being carefully shut, and care being first taken to cover the stalk withpitch. By this mode of treatment, he assures us, they willattain a larger size than they would if left to ripen on the tree.As for the other kinds of pomes, he says that they should bewrapped up separately in fig-leaves, the windfalls being carefully excluded, and then stored in baskets of osier, or elsecovered over with potters' earth.</p><p>Pears are kept in earthen vessels pitched inside; whenfilled, the vessels are reversed and then buried in pits. TheTarentine pear, Varro says, is gathered very late, while theAnician keeps very well in raisin wine. Sorb apples, too, aresimilarly kept in holes in the ground, the vessel being turnedupside down, and a layer of plaster placed on the lid: it should beburied two feet deep, in a sunny spot; sorbs<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> are also hung, likegrapes, in the inside of large vessels, together with the branches.</p><p>Some of the more recent authors are found to pay a morescrupulous degree of attention to these various particulars, andrecommend that the gathering of grapes or pomes, which areintended for keeping, should take place while the moon is onthe wane,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> after the third hour of the day, and while theweather is clear, or dry winds prevail. In a similar manner,the selection, they say, ought to be made from a dry spot, andthe fruit should be plucked before it is fully ripe, a momentbeing chosen while the moon is below the horizon. Grapes,they say, should be selected that have a strong, hard mallets-talk, and after the decayed berries have been carefully removed with a pair of scissors, they should be hung up inside of<pb n="3305" />a large vessel which has just been pitched, care being taken toclose all access to the south wind, by covering the lid with acoat of plaster. The same method, they say, should be adoptedfor keeping sorb apples and pears, the stalks being carefullycovered with pitch; care should be taken, too, that the vessels are kept at a distance from water.</p><p>There are some persons who adopt the following method forpreserving grapes. They take them off together with thebranch, and place them, while still upon it, in a layer ofplaster,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> taking care to fasten either end of the branch in abulb of squill.<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> Others, again, go so far as to place themwithin vessels containing wine, taking care, however, that thegrapes, as they hang, do not touch it. Some persons putapples in plates of earth, and then leave them to float in wine,a method by which it is thought that a vinous flavour is imparted to them: while some think it a better plan to preserve allthese kinds of fruit in millet. Most people, however, contentthemselves with first digging a hole in the ground, a couple offeet in depth; a layer of sand is then placed at the bottom,and the fruit is arranged upon it, and covered with an earthenlid, over which the earth is thrown. Some persons again evengo so far as to give their grapes a coating of potters' chalk, andthen hang them up when dried in the sun; when required foruse, the chalk is removed with water.<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> Apples are also preserved in a similar manner; but with them wine is employedfor getting off the chalk. Indeed, we find a very similar planpursued with apples of the finest quality; they have a coatinglaid upon them of either plaster or wax; but they are apt, ifnot quite ripe when this was done, by the increase in theirsize to break their casing.<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> When apples are thus prepared,they are always laid with the stalk downwards.<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> Somepersons pluck the apple together with the branch, the ends ofwhich they thrust into the pith of elder,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> and then bury it in<pb n="3306" />the way already pointed out.<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> There are some who assign toeach apple or pear its separate vessel of clay, and after care-fully pitching the cover, enclose it again in a larger vessel:occasionally, too, the fruit is placed on a layer of flocks ofwool, or else in baskets,<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> with a lining of chaff and clay.Other persons follow a similar plan, but use earthen plates forthe purpose; while others, again, employ the same method,but dig a hole in the earth, and after placing a layer of sand,lay the fruit on top of it, and then cover the whole with dryearth. Persons, too, are sometimes known to give quinces acoating of Pontic<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> wax, and then plunge them in honey.Columella<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> informs us, that fruit is kept by being carefullyput in earthen vessels, which then receive a coating of pitch, andare placed in wells or cisterns to sink to the bottom. The peopleof maritime Liguria, in the vicinity of the Alps, first dry theirgrapes in the sun,<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> and wrap them up in bundles of rushes,which are then covered with plaster. The Greeks follow asimilar plan, but substitute for rushes the leaves of the plane-tree, or of the vine itself, or else of the fig, which they dryfor a single day in the shade, and then place in a cask inalternate layers with husks<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> of grapes. It is by this methodthat they preserve the grapes of Cos and Berytus, which areinferior to none in sweetness. Some persons, when thus pre-paring them, plunge the grapes into lie-ashes the moment theytake them from the vine, and then dry them in the sun; theythen steep them in warm water, after which they put them todry again in the sun: and last of all, as already mentioned,wrap them up in bundles formed of layers of leaves and grapehusks. There are some who prefer keeping their grapes insawdust,<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> or else in shavings of the fir-tree, poplar, and ash:while others think it the best plan to hang them up in thegranary, at a careful distance from the apples, directly after thegathering, being under the impression that the very best cover-ing for them as they hang is the dust<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> that naturally arises<pb n="3307" />from the floor. Grapes are effectually protected against theattacks of wasps by being sprinkled with oil<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> spirted from themouth. Of palm-dates we have already spoken.<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Specularibus." the alludes to windows of transparent stone, lapisspecularis, or mica; windows of glass being probably unknown in his time.The ordinary windows were merely openings closed with shutters.
