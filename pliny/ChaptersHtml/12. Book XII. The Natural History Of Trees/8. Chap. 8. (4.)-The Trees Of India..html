<div2 type="chapter" n="8" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 8. (4.)ÑTHE TREES OF INDIA.</head><p>In describing the country of the Seres, we have already<pb n="3108" />made mention<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> of the wool-bearing trees which it produces;and we have, likewise, touched<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> upon the extraordinarymagnitude of the trees of India. Virgil<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> has spoken inglowing terms of the ebony-tree, one of those which are peculiar to India, and he further informs us, that it will grow inno other country. Herodotus, however, has preferred toascribe<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> it to ®thiopia; and states that the people of thatcountry were in the habit of paying to the kings of Persia,every third year, by way of tribute,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> one hundred billets ofebony-wood, together with a certain quantity of gold andivory. Nor ought we here to omit the fact, inasmuch as thesame author has stated to that effect, that the ®thiopianswere also in the habit of paying, by way of tribute, twentylarge elephants' teeth. So high was the esteem in whichivory was held in the year from the building of our city,310: for it was at that period<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> that this author was compiling his History at Thurii, in Italy; which is all the moreremarkable, from the implicit confidence we place in him,when he says<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> that up to that time, no native of Asia orGreece, to his knowledge at least, had ever beheld the riverPadus. The plan of ®thiopia, which, as we have alreadymentioned,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> was recently laid before the Emperor Nero, informs us, that this tree is very uncommon in the country thatlies between Syene, the extreme boundary of the empire, andMero‘, a distance of eight hundred and ninety-six miles; andthat, in fact, the only kind of tree that is to be found there, isthe palm. It was, probably, for this reason, that ebony heldthe third place in the tribute that was thus imposed.<pb n="3109" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. vi. c. 20.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. vii. c. 2.

There is little doubt that, under the general name of"ebony," the wood of many kinds of trees was,-and is still, imported intothe western world, so that both Herodotus and Virgil may have been correct in representing ebony as the product of both India and ®thiopia.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Herodotus says <hi rend="ital">two</hi> hundred.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In Italy, whither he had retired from the hostile attacks of his fellow-citizens.
