<div2 type="chapter" n="79" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 79.—HISTORICAL FACTS CONNECTED WITH THE DURABILITYOF WOOD.</head><p>Of all the woods, the ebony, the cypress, and the cedar areconsidered to be the most durable, a good proof of which is tobe seen in the timber of which the Temple of Diana at Ephesusis built: it being now four hundred years since it was erected,at the joint expense of the whole of Asia;<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and, what is a well-known fact, the roof is wholly constructed of planks of cedar.As to the statue of the goddess, there is some doubt of whatwood it is made; all the writers say that it is ebony, with theexception of Mucianus, who was three times consul, one ofthe very latest among the writers that have seen it; he declares that it is made of the wood of the vine, and that it hasnever been changed all the seven times that the temple hasbeen rebuilt. He says, too, that it was Endæus who madechoice of this wood, and even goes so far as to mention theartist's name, a thing that really surprises me very much, seeing that he attributes to it an antiquity that dates before thetimes of Father Liber, and of Minerva even. He states, also,that, by the aid of numerous apertures, it is soaked withnard, in order that the moist nature of that drug may preservethe wood and keep the seams<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> close together: I am rathersurprised, however, that there should be any seams in thestatue, considering the very moderate size it is. He informsus, also, that the doors are made of cypress, and that thewood, which has now lasted very nearly four hundred years,has all the appearance of new.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> It is worthy of remark, too,that the wood of these doors, after the pieces had been gluedtogether, was left to season four years before they were put<pb n="3424" />up: cypress was made choice of from the circumstance that itis the only kind of wood that maintains its polish to all futuretime.</p><p>And have we not the statue of Vejovis,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> also, made of cypress,still preserved in the Capitol, where it was consecrated in theyear of the City 661? The Temple of Apollo, too, at Utica,is equally celebrated: there we may see beams of cedar stillin existence, and in just the same condition in which theywere when erected at the first building of that city, elevenhundred and seventy-eight years ago. At Saguntum, too, inSpain, there is a temple of Diana, which was brought thitherby the original founders of the place, from the island of Zacynthus, in the year 200 before the taking of Troy, Bocchussays—It is preserved beneath the town, they say. Hannibal,being induced thereto by feelings of religious veneration,spared this temple, and its beams, made of juniper, are stillin existence at this very day. But the most memorable instance of all is that of the temple which was dedicated to thesame goddess at Aulis, several ages before the Trojan War: ofwhat wood, however, it was originally built is a fact that hasbeen long lost in oblivion. Speaking in general terms, wemay say that those woods are of the greatest durability whichare the most odoriferous.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span></p><p>Next to those woods of which we have just spoken, that ofthe mulberry is held in the highest degree of esteem, and itwill even turn black when old. There are some trees, again,that are more durable than others, when employed for certainpurposes. The wood of the elm lasts the best in the open air,that of the robur when buried in the ground, and that of thequercus when exposed to the action of water: indeed, thewood of this last, if employed in works above ground, is aptto split and warp. The wood of the larch thrives best in themidst of moisture; the same is the case, too, with that of theblack alder. The wood of the robur spoils by exposure to theaction of sea-water. The beech and the walnut are far fromdisapproved of for constructions under water, and, in fact,these are the principal woods, too, that are used for works<pb n="3425" />under ground: the same is the case, also, with the juniper;which is equally serviceable when exposed to the atmosphere.The woods of the beech and the cirrus<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> very quickly deteriorate, and that of the æsculus will not withstand the actionof water. On the other hand, the alder, when driven into theground in marshy localities, is of everlasting duration, andable to support the very heaviest weights. The wood of thecherry is strong, while those of the elm and the ash are pliable, though apt to warp: these last will still retain theirflexibility, and be less liable to warp, if the wood is left tostand and dry upon the trunk after the pith has been cutaround.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> It is said that the larch, when used for sea-goingships, is liable to the attacks<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> of the teredo, as, in fact, all thewoods are, with the exception of the wild and cultivated olive.It is a fact, too, that there are some woods that are more liableto spoil in the sea, and others in the ground.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Asia Minor, namely.
