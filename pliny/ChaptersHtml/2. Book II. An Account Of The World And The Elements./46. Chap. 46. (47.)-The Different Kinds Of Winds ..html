<div2 type="chapter" n="46" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 46. (47.)—THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF WINDS<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>.</head><p>The ancients reckoned only four winds (nor indeed doesHomer mention more<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>) corresponding to the four parts ofthe world; a very poor reason, as we now consider it. Thenext generation added eight others, but this was too refinedand minute a division; the moderns have taken a middlecourse, and, out of this great number, have added four to theoriginal set. There are, therefore, two in each of the fourquarters of the heavens. From the equinoctial rising of thesun<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> proceeds Subsolanus<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, and, from his brumal rising,Vulturnus<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>; the former is named by the Greeks Apeliotes<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>, thelatter Eurus. From the south we have Auster, and from thebrumal setting of the sun, Africus; these were named Notos<pb n="1074" />and Libs. From the equinoctial setting proceeds Favonius<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>,and from the solstitial setting, Corus<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>; these were namedZephyrus and Argestes. From the seven stars comes Septemtrio, betweenwhich and the solstitial rising we haveAquilo, named Aparctias and Boreas<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>. By a more minutesubdivision we interpose four others, Thrascias, betweenSeptemtrio and the solstitial setting; Cæcias, between Aquiloand the equinoctial rising; and Phœnices, between the brumalrising and the south. And also, at an equal distance fromthe south and the winter setting, between Libs and Notos,and compounded of the two, is Libonotos. Nor is this all.For some persons have added a wind, which they have namedMeses, between Boreas and Cæcias, and one between Eurusand Notos, named Euronotus<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>.</p><p>There are also certain winds peculiar to certain countries,which do not extend beyond certain districts, as Sciron inAttica, deviating a little from Argestes, and not known inthe other parts of Greece. In other places it is a littlehigher on the card and is named Olympias; but all these<pb n="1075" />have gone by the name of Argestes. In some places Cæciasis named Hellespontia, and the same is done in other cases.In the province of Narbonne the most noted wind is Circius;it is not inferior to any of the winds in violence, frequentlydriving the waves before it, to Ostia<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>, straight across the Liguriansea. Yet this same wind is unknown in other parts,not even reaching Vienne, a city in the same province; formeeting with a high ridge of hills, just before it arrives atthat district, it is checked, although it be the most violent ofall the winds. Fabius also asserts, that the south windsnever penetrate into Egypt. Hence this law of nature isobvious, that winds have their stated seasons and limits.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In his account and nomenclature of the winds, Pliny has, for themost part, followed Aristotle, Meteor. lib. ii. cap. 4. pp. 558–560, andcap. 6. pp. 563–565. The description of the different winds by Senecais not very different, but where it does not coincide with Aristotle's, ourauthor has generally preferred the former; see Nat. Quæst. lib. 5. Wehave an account of the different winds, as prevailing at particular seasons, in Ptolemy, De Judiciis Astrol. 1. 9. For the nomenclature anddirections of the winds, we may refer to the remarks of Hardouin, Lemaire, i. 328 <hi rend="ital">et seq.</hi></p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Odyss. v. 295, 296.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In giving names to the different winds, the author designates thepoints of the compass whence they proceed, by the place where the sunrises or sets, at the different periods of the year. The following are theterms which he employs :—"Oriens æquinoctialis," the place where thesun rises at the equinox, i. e. the East. "Oriens brumalis," where herises on the shortest day, the S.E. "Occasus brumalis," where he setson the shortest day, the S.W. "Occasus æquinoctialis," where he setsat the equinox, the W. "Occasus solstitialis," where he sets on thelongest day, the N.W. "Exortus solstitialis," where he rises on thelongest day, the N.E. "Inter septemtrionem et occasum solstitialem,"between N. and N.W., N.N.W. "Inter aquilonem et exortumæquinoctialem," between N. and N.E., N.N.E. "Inter ortum brumalem etmeridiem," between S. and S.E., S.S.E. Inter meridiem et hybernumoccidentem," between S. and S.W., S.S.W.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Quod sub sole nasci videtur."</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This name was probably derived from the town Vulturnum in Campania.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Seneca informs us, that what the Latins name Subsolanus, is namedby the Greeks <foreign lang="greek">)Afhliw/ths;</foreign> Quæst.
