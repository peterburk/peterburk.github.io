It rises<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> at the extremity of the mountains ofthe Peligni, passes through the territory of the Marsi and throughLake Fucinus, and then, without deviating, makes directly forRome: shortly after this, it loses itself in certain caverns, andonly reappears in the territory of Tibur, from which it isbrought to the City by an arched aqueduct nine miles inlength. Ancus Marcius, one of the Roman kings, was thefirst<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> who thought of introducing this water into the City.At a later period, the works were repaired by Quintus Mar-cius Rex: and, more recently, in his prætorship, by M.Agrippa.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span><pb n="5488" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A considerable number of its arches are yet standing, and it still inpart supplies Rome with water.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">At Sublaqueum, now Subiaco.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Primus auspicatus est."
