This<pb n="5068" />beetle is continually ascending the interior of the stalk, andas often descending, while it emits a sound like the cry of akid; a circumstance to which the plant is indebted for its name.There is nothing in existence, they say, more beneficial to thevoice.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From <foreign lang="greek">e)ri/fos,</foreign> a "kid."
