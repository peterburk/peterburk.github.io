<div2 type="chapter" n="88" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 88. (62.)—THE ANTIPATHIES AND SYMPATHIES THATEXIST BETWEEN AQUATIC ANIMALS.</head><p>There are also marvellous instances to be found of antipathiesand sympathies existing between them. The mullet and thewolf-fish<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> are animated with a mutual hatred; and so too, theconger and the murena gnaw each other<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> tails. The crayfish has so great a dread of the polypus, that if it sees it near,it expires in an instant: the conger dreads the cray-fish;while, again, the conger tears the body of the polypus. Nigidiusinforms us that the wolf-fish gnaws the tail of the mullet, andyet that, during certain months, they are on terms of friendship; all those, however, which thus lose their tails, survivetheir misfortune. On the other hand, in addition to those whichwe have already mentioned as going in company together, aninstance of friendship is found in the balæna and the musculus,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span><pb n="2476" />for, as the eye—Brows of the former are very heavy, they sometimes fall over its eyes, and quite close them by their ponderousness, upon which the musculus swims before, and points outthe shallow places which are likely to prove inconvenient toits vast bulk,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> thus serving it in the stead of eyes. Weshall now have to speak of the nature of the birds.</p><p>SUMMARY.—Remarkable facts, narratives, and observations,650.</p><p>ROMAN AUTHORS QUOTED.—Turranius Gracilis,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> Trogus,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>Mæcenas,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> Alfius Flavus,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> Cornelius Nepos,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> Laberius theMimographer,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> Fabianus,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> Fenestella,<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> Mucianus,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> Ælius<pb n="2477" />Stilo,<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> Statius Sebosus,<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> Melissus,<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> Seneca,<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> Cicero,<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> Æmilius Macer,<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> Messala Corvinus,<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> Trebius Niger,<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> Nigidius.<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span>FOREIGN AUTHORS QUOTED.—Aristotle,<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span> King Archelaus,<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span>Callimachus,<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span> Democritus,<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span> Theophrastus,<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span> Thrasyllus,<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span>Hegesidemus,<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span> Cythnius,<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span> Alexander Polyhistor.<span id="ref_31"><a href="#note_31">[31]</a></span><pb n="2478" /></p></div2></div1><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle, Hist.

Hardouin suggests that Plinymay have learned this fact from the works of Nigidius Figulus.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier remarks, that in another passage, B. xi. c. 62, Pliny states thatthe "musculus qui balænam antecedit" has no teeth, but only bristles inits mouth. Now, in B. xxxii. c. 53, he speaks of the musculus as amongthe largest of animals; from which Cuvier concludes it to have been aspecies of whale, probably the "rorqual" of the Mediterranean. In confirmation of this, he thinks that the word "antecedit," in B. xi. c. 62,has not the meaning of "goes before," but "exceeds in size;" thoughhere it is spoken of as leading the whale; and Oppian, Ælian, Plutarch,Claudian, speak of the conductor of the whale as a little fish. He isof opinion, in fine, that either Pliny or some of the authors fromwhich he has borrowed, have made a mistake in the name, and probably given that of "musculus," which was really a large fish, to a smallone, which was commonly supposed to attend on the movements of thewhale.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is evident from this passage, that Pliny is speaking of a little fishhere, and not one to which he would assign such bulk as is ascribed to themusculus in B. xxxii. c. 53.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See end of B. iii.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See end of B. vii.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Caius Cilnius Mecænas, or rather Mæcenas, a descendant of the kingsof Etruria, and of equestrian rank. He was the favourite minister ofAugustus, and the friend and patron of Horace, Virgil, and most of themore deserving among the learned of his day. He is supposed tohave written two tragedies, the Prometheus and Octavia; an epic poem,and a work on Natural History, to which Pliny frequently alludes, andwhich seems to have related, principally, to fishes and gems. He is alsothought to have written some memoirs of the life of Augustus.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A rhetorician, who flourished in the reigns of Augustus and Tiberius.His school was attended by the elder Seneca, who had then recently removed to Rome from Corduba.

There is a work, still extant, under his name, "On the Virtuesof Herbs;" which, no doubt, belongs to the middle ages.

He afterwards served under Antony,and then Augustus; the centre of whose fleet he commanded at Actium.About two years before his death, which happened in the middle of thereign of Augustus, his memory failed him, and he was often unable torecollect his own name. He wrote a history, or rather, commentaries onthe Civil wars after the death of Cæsar, and towards the close of his lifecomposed a genealogical work "On the Families of Rome." He alsowrote poems of a satirical, and sometimes licentious character; and workson grammar, the titles of only two of which have come down to us. Hewas especially famous for his eloquence.</p><p><span id="note_21"><a href="#ref_21">21. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See end of B. viii.</p><p><span id="note_22"><a href="#ref_22">22. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See end of B. vi.</p><p><span id="note_23"><a href="#ref_23">23. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See end of B. ii.</p><p><span id="note_24"><a href="#ref_24">24. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See end of B. viii.</p><p><span id="note_25"><a href="#ref_25">25. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See end of B. iv.</p><p><span id="note_26"><a href="#ref_26">26. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See end of B. ii.</p><p><span id="note_27"><a href="#ref_27">27. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See end of B. iii.</p><p><span id="note_28"><a href="#ref_28">28. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See end of B. iii.</p><p><span id="note_29"><a href="#ref_29">29. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See end of B. ii.</p><p><span id="note_30"><a href="#ref_30">30. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Nothing whatever is known of him.</p><p><span id="note_31"><a href="#ref_31">31. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See end of B. iii.</p></body>
