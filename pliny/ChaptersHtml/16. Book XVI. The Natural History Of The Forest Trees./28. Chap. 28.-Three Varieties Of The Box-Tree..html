<div2 type="chapter" n="28" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 28.ÑTHREE VARIETIES OF THE BOX-TREE.</head><p>One of the most highly esteemed of all the woods is the<pb n="3369" />box,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> but it is seldom veined, and then only the wood of theroot. In other respects, it is a wood, so to say, of quiet andunpretending appearance, but highly esteemed for a certaindegree of hardness and its pallid hue: the tree, too, is veryextensively employed in ornamental gardening.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> There arethree<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> varieties of it: the Gallic<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> box, which is trained toshoot upwards in a pyramidal form, and attains a very considerable height; the oleaster,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> which is condemned as beingutterly worthless, and emits a disagreeable odour; and a third,known as the "Italian" box,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> a wild variety, in my opinion,which has been improved by cultivation. This last spreadsmore than the others, and forms a thick hedge: it is an evergreen, and is easily clipped.</p><p>The box-tree abounds on the Pyrenean<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> range, the mountains of Cytorus, and the country about Berecynthus.<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> Thetrunk grows to the largest size in the island of Corsica,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> andits blossom is by no means despicable; it is this that causesthe honey there to be bitter.<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> The seed of the box is held inaversion by all animals. That which grows upon MountOlympus in Macedonia is not more slender than the otherkinds, but the tree is of a more stunted growth. It lovesspots exposed to the cold winds and the sun: in fire, too, itmanifests all the hardness of iron; it gives out no flame, andis of no use whatever for the manufacture of charcoal.<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span><pb n="3370" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Buxus sempervirens of Linn¾us.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is still extensively used for a similar purpose.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There are only two species now known: that previously mentioned,and the Buxus Balearica of Lamarck. The first is divided into the fourvarieties, arborescens, angustifolia, suffruticosa, and myrtifolia.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Buxus sempervirens of Linn¾us; very common in the south ofFrance, and on the banks of the Loire.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is doubtful if this is a box at all. The wild olive, mentioned in B.xv. c. 7, has the same name; all the varieties of the box emit a disagreeable smell.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A variety of the Buxus sempervirens, the same as the Buxus suffruticosa of Lamarck.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Pyrenean box is mostly of the arborescent kind.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In Phrygia. See B. v. c. 29.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The arborescent variety.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is doubted by FŽe, but it is by no means impossible. In Pennsylvania the bees collect a poisonous honey from the Kalmia latifolia.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A very good charcoal might be made from it, but the wood is toovaluable for such a purpose. It burns with a bright, clear flame, andthrows out a considerable heat.</p></body>
