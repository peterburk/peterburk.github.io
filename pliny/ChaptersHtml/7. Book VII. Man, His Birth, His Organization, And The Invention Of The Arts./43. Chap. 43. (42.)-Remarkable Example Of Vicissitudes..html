And yet he was proscribed asecond time; for he survived Sylla, even to the days of Antony, and, as it appears, was proscribed by him, for no otherreason but because he had been proscribed before.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We have a similar account of the fate of Fidustius in Dion Cassius,by whom he is named Filuscius.ÑB.
