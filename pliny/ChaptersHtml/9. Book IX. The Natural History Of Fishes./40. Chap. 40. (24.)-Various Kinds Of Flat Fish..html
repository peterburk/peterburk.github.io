(24.)ÑVARIOUS KINDS OF FLAT FISH.</head><p>There is another kind of flat fish, which, instead of bones, hascartilage, such, for instance, as the raia,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> the pastinaca,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> thesquatina,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> the torpedo,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> and those which, under their respectiveGreek names, are known as the ox,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> the lamia,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> the eagle,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> and<pb n="2412" />the frog.<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> In this number, also, the squali<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> ought to be included,although they are not flat fish. Aristotle was the first to callthese fish by the one generic name of <foreign lang="greek">sela/xh,</foreign><span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> which he hasgiven them: we, however, have no mode of distinguishing them,unless, indeed, we choose to call them the "cartilaginous"fishes. All these fish are carnivorous,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> and feed lying on theirbacks, just as dolphins do, as already<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> noticed; while the otherfishes,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> too, are oviparous, this one kind, with the exception ofthat known as the sea-frog, is viviparous, like the cetacea.<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The ray.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The sting-ray; the Raia pastinaca of Linn¾us.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The angel-fish; the Squalus squatina of Linn¾us.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Raia torpedo of Linn¾us.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Galen, in his explanation of words used by Hippocrates, speaks of the,<foreign lang="greek">bou=s qala/ssios,</foreign> which is also described by Oppian, Halieut. B. ii. 1. 141,<hi rend="ital">et seq.</hi> He speaks of it as growing to the length of eleven or twelve cubits,and having small, weak teeth, which are not easily seen, and compares itin appearance to the roof of a house. Cuvier thinks, that although itshorns are not mentioned, a species of large horned ray is alluded to, whichis known by the modern naturalists by the name of Cephalopterus, and hethinks it very likely these horns may have given it its Greek appellation.Indeed Pliny himself, in another place, B. xxxii. c. 53, speaks of it underthe name of "cornuta," the "horned-fish."</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A species of ray, most probably.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier suggests that this was the mylobates, the Raia aquila of Lin-n¾us, which probably obtained this name on account of the width of thepectoral fins, and its peculiar shape.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot"><foreign lang="greek">Ba/traxos a(lieu\s,</foreign> the sea-frog, the Lophius piscatorius of Linn¾us,and the baudroie of the French. Cuvier remarks, that though there islittle solidity or firmness in the bones of this animal, it is not properly acartilaginous fish.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is borrowed from Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. v., who, however, says,<foreign lang="greek">kai\ pa/nta ta\ galew/dh;</foreign> from which Massarius, Turnebus, and HippolytusSalvianus are inclined to read "galei," instead of "squali." Both terms,however, Hardouin says, are used to denote the genus which the Frenchcall "chiens de mer," "dog-fish."</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is curious that Aristotle, though he was the inventor of this name,has nowhere stated in what it originated. Galen, De Alim. Fac. B. iii.c. 36, says that it is <foreign lang="greek">a)po tou= se/las e)/xeion,</foreign> from the fact of their shining atnight.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 5, and De Part. Anim.

Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. viii. c. 5, and B.ii. c. 16, makes the same exception as to the sea-frog or frog-fish.</p></body>
