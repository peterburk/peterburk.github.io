<div2 type="chapter" n="33" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 33.—THE LEEK.</head><p>While upon this subject, it will be as well, too, to speak ofthe leek,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> on account of the affinity which it bears to the plantsjust mentioned, and more particularly because cut-leek hasrecently acquired considerable celebrity from the use made ofit by the Emperor Nero. That prince, to improve his voice,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>used to eat leeks and oil every month, upon stated days, abstaining from every other kind of food, and not touching somuch as a morsel of bread even. Leeks are reproduced fromseed, sown just after the autumnal equinox; if they are intended for cutting,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> the seed is sown thicker than otherwise.The leeks in the same bed are cut repeatedly, till it is quite exhausted, and they are always kept well manured. If they are<pb n="4174" />wanted to bulb before being cut, when they have grown tosome size they are transplanted to another bed, the extremitiesof the leaves being snipped off without touching the white part,and the heads stripped of the outer coats. The ancients werein the habit of placing a stone or potsherd upon the leek, tomake the head grow all the larger, and the same with thebulbs as well; but at the present day it is the usual practiceto move the fibrous roots gently with the weeding-hook, so thatby being bent they may nourish the plant, and not withdrawthe juices from it.</p><p>It is a remarkable fact, that, though the leek stands in needof manure and a rich soil, it has a particular aversion to water;and yet its nature depends very much upon the natural properties of the soil. The most esteemed leeks are those grown inEgypt, and next to them those of Ostia and Aricia.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> Of theleek for cutting, there are two varieties: that with grass-green<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> leaves and incisions distinctly traced on them, and theleek with paler and rounder leaves, the incisions being morelightly marked. There is a story told, that Mela<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>, a memberof the Equestrian order, being accused of mal-administrationby order of the Emperor Tiberius, swallowed in his despairleek-juice to the amount of three denarii in weight of silver,and expired upon the spot without the slightest symptom ofpain. It is said, however, that a larger dose than this is productive of no injurious effects whatever<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Allium porrum of Linnæus.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This prejudice in favour of the leek, as Fée remarks, still exists. Itis doubtful, however, whether its mucilage has any beneficial effect uponthe voice.
