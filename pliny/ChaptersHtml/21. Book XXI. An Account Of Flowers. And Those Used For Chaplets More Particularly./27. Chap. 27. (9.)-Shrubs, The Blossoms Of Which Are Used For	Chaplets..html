(9.)—SHRUBS, THE BLOSSOMS OF WHICH ARE USED FOR	CHAPLETS.</head><p>Having thus passed in review nearly all the best-knowncolours, we must now give our attention to the chaplets whichare pleasing merely on account of the variety of their materials. Of such chaplets there are two kinds, one composed offlowers, the other of leaves. The flowers so employed, I maysay, are those of broom<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>—the yellow blossom gathered fromit—the rhododendron,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and the jujube,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> also known as thetree of Cappadocia, which bears an odoriferous flower similarto that of the olive. Among the brambles, too, we find thecyclaminum growing, of which we shall have to speak moreat length on a future occasion:<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> its flower, which reflects thehues of the purple of Colossæ,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> is used as an ingredient inchaplets.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xvi. c. 69, B. xviii. c. 65, B. xix. c. 2, B. xxiv. c. 40; alsoc. 42 of the present Book.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Nerium oleander of Linnæus.
