<div2 type="chapter" n="9" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 9. (7.)—THIRTY-EIGHT VARIETIES OF FOREIGN WINES.</head><p>We will now, in a similar manner, give a description of thevarieties found in the parts beyond sea. After the winesmentioned by Homer, and of which we have already spoken,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>those held in the highest esteem were the wines of Thasosand Chios,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and of the latter more particularly the sort knownas "Arvisium."<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> By the side of these has been placed thewine of Lesbos,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> upon the authority of Erasistratus, a famousphysician, who flourished about the year of the City of Rome450. At the present day, the most esteemed of all is the wineof Clazomenæ,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> since they have learned to season it moresparingly with sea-water. The wine of Lesbos has naturallya taste of sea-water. That from Mount Tmolus<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> is not somuch esteemed by itself<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> for its qualities as a wine, as for itspeculiar sweetness. It is on account of this that it is mixedwith other wines, for the purpose of modifying their harshflavour, by imparting to them a portion of its own sweetness;while at the same time it gives them age, for immediatelyafter the mixture they appear to be much older than theyreally are. Next in esteem after these are the wines of<pb n="3246" />Sicyon,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> Cyprus,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> Telmessus,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> Tripolis,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> Berytus,<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> Tyre,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>and Sebennys, this last is grown in Egypt, being the produceof three varieties of grape of the very highest quality, knownas the Thasian,<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> the æthalus,<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> and the peuce.<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> Next inrank are the hippodamantian<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> wine, the Mystic,<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> the cantharite,<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> the protropum<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> of Cnidos, the wine of the catacecaumene,<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> the Petritan,<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> and the Myconian;<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span> as to theMesogitic,<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span> it has been found to give head-ache, while that ofEphesus is far from wholesome, being seasoned with sea-waterand defrutum.<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span> It is said that the wine of Apamea<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span> is remarkably well adapted for making mulsum,<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span> like that of Præ-tutia in Italy: for this is a quality peculiar to only certainkinds of wine, the mixture of two sweet liquids being in<pb n="3247" />general not attended with good results. The protagion<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span> isquite gone out of date, a wine which the school of Asclepiadeshas reckoned as next in merit to those of Italy. The physicianApollodorus, in the work which he wrote recommending KingPtolemy what wines in particular to drink—for in his timethe wines of Italy were not generally known—has spoken inhigh terms of that of Naspercene in Pontus, next to which heplaces the Oretic,<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span> and then the Æneatian,<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span> the Leucadian,<span id="ref_31"><a href="#note_31">[31]</a></span>the Ambraciotic,<span id="ref_32"><a href="#note_32">[32]</a></span> and the Peparethian,<span id="ref_33"><a href="#note_33">[33]</a></span> to which last he givesthe preference over all the rest, though he states that it enjoyed an inferior reputation, from the fact of its not beingconsidered fit for drinking until it had been kept six years.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In c. 6 of this Book.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Chian held the first rank, the Thasian the second.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From Arvisium, or Ariusium, a hilly district in the centre of theisland.
