It grows inshady places only. The seed bears the same name as the plant,and has a strong resemblance to that of hart-wort: it is onlyemployed in medicine.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The umbelliferous plant known as the Heracleum spondylium of Linn¾us. It is commonly found in France, where it is called Berce-branc-ursine. It received its name from the resemblance of its smell to that ofthe sphondyle, a fetid kind of wood-beetle.</p></body>
