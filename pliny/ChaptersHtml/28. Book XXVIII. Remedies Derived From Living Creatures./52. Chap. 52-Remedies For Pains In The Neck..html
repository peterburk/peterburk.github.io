For the painful cramp, attended withinflexibility, to which people give the name of "opisthotony,"the urine of a she-goat, injected into the ears, is found veryuseful; as also a liniment made of the dung of that animal,mixed with bulbs.In cases where the nails have been crushed, it is an excel-lent plan to attach to them the gall of any kind of animal.Whitlows upon the fingers should be treated with driedbull's gall, dissolved in warm water. Some persons are in thehabit of adding sulphur and alum, of each an equal weight.</p></div2></body>
