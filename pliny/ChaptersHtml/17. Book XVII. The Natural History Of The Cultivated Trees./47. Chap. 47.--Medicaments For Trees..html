<div2 type="chapter" n="47" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 47.—-MEDICAMENTS FOR TREES.</head><p>Wounds and incisions of trees are treated also with pigeondung and swine manure. If pomegranates are acid, the rootsof the tree are cleared, and swine's dung is applied to them:the result is, that in the first year the fruit will have a vinousflavour, but in the succeeding one it will be sweet. Somepersons are of opinion that the pomegranate should be wateredfour times a year with a mixture of human urine and water,at the rate of an amphora to each tree; or else that the ex-tremities of the branches should be sprinkled with silphium<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>steeped in wine. The stalk of the pomegranate should betwisted, if it is found to split while on the tree. The fig, too,should be drenched with the amurca of olives, and other treeswhen they are ailing, with lees of wine; or else lupines maybe sown about the roots. The water, too, of a decoction oflupines is beneficial to the fruit, if poured upon the roots ofthe tree. When it thunders at the time of the Vulcanalia,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>the figs fall off; the only remedy for which is to have the areabeneath ready covered with barley-straw. Lime applied tothe roots of the tree makes cherries come sooner to maturity,and ripen more rapidly. The best plan, too, with the cherry,as with all other kinds, is to thin the fruit, so that that whichis left behind may grow all the larger.</p><p>(28.) There are some trees, again, which thrive all the betterfor being maltreated,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> or else are stimulated by pungent substances; the palm and the mastich for instance, which derivenutriment from salt water.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> Ashes have the same virtues as<pb n="3533" />salt, only in a more modified degree; for which reason it is,that fig-trees are sprinkled with them; as also with rue,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> tokeep away worms, and to prevent the roots from rotting.What is still more even, it is recommended to throw salt<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>water on the roots of vines, if they are too full of humours;and if the fruit falls off, to sprinkle them with ashes andvinegar, or with sandarach if the grapes are rotting.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> If,again, a vine is not productive, it should be sprinkled andrubbed with strong vinegar and ashes; and if the grapes, instead of ripening, dry and shrivel up, the vine should be loppednear the roots,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> and the wound and fibres drenched with strongvinegar and stale urine; after which, the roots should becovered up with mud annealed with these liquids, and theground spaded repeatedly.</p><p>As to the olive, if it gives promise of but little fruit, theroots should be bared, and left exposed to the winter cold,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> amode of treatment for which it is all the better.</p><p>All these operations depend each year upon the state of theweather, and require to be sometimes retarded, and at othertimes precipitated. The very element of fire even has its ownutility, in the case of the reed for instance; which, after thereed-bed has been burnt, will spring up all the thicker andmore pliable.<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span></p><p>Cato,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> too, gives receipts for certain medicaments, specifying the proportions as well; for the roots of the large treeshe prescribes an amphora, and for those of the smaller ones,an urna, of amphora of olives, mixed with water in equal proportions, recommending the roots to be cleared, and themixture to be gradually poured upon them. In addition tothis, in the case of the olive and the fig, he recommends thata layer of straw should be first placed around them. In thefig, too, more particularly, he says that in spring the rootsshould be well moulded up; the result of which is, that thefruit will not fall off while green, and the tree will be all themore productive, and not affected with roughness of the bark.<pb n="3534" />In the same way, too,<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> to prevent the vine-fretter<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> from attacking the tree, he recommends that two congii of amurca ofolives should be boiled down to the consistency of honey, afterwhich it must be boiled again with one-third part of bitumen,and one-fourth of sulphur; and this should be done, he says, inthe open air, for fear of its igniting if prepared in-doors; withthis mixture, the vine is to be anointed at the ends of thebranches and at the axils; after which, no more fretters willbe seen. Some persons are content to make a fumigationwith this mixture while the wind is blowing towards the vine,for three days in succession.</p><p>Many persons, again, attribute no less utility and nutritiousvirtue to urine than Cato does to amurca; only they add toit an equal proportion of water, it being injurious if employedby itself. Some give the name of " volucre"<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> to an insectwhich eats away the young grapes: to prevent this, they rubthe pruning-knife, every time it is sharpened, upon a beaver-skin, and then prune the tree with it: it is recommended also,that after the pruning, the knife should be well rubbed withthe blood of a bear.<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> Ants, too, are a great pest to trees;they are kept away, however, by smearing the trunk with redearth and tar: if a fish, too, is hung up in the vicinity of thetree, these insects will collect in that one spot. Anothermethod, again, is to pound lupines in oil,<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> and anoint theroots with the mixture. Many people kill both ants as wellas moles<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> with amurca, and preserve apples from caterpillarsas well as from rotting, by touching the top of the tree withthe gall of a green lizard.</p><p>Another method, too, of preventing caterpillars, is to makea woman,<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> with her monthly courses on her, go round eachtree, barefooted and ungirt. Again, for the purpose of pre-<pb n="3535" />venting animals from doing mischief by browsing upon theleaves, they should be sprinkled with cow-dung each time afterrain, the showers having the effect of washing away thevirtues of this application.</p><p>The industry of man has really made some very wonderfuldiscoveries, and, indeed, has gone so far as to lead manypersons to believe, that hail-storms may be averted by means ofa certain charm, the words of which I really could not ventureseriously to transcribe; although we find that Cato<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> has giventhose which are employed as a charm for sprained limbs, employing splints of reed in conjunction with it. The sameauthor,<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> too, has allowed of consecrated trees and groves beingcut down, after a sacrifice has first been offered: the form ofprayer, and the rest of the proceedings, will be found fully setforth in the same work of his.</p><p>SUMMARY.—Remarkable facts, narratives; and observations,eight hundred and eighty.</p><p>ROMAN AUTHORS QUOTED.—Cornelius Nepos,<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> Cato<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> theCensor, M.
