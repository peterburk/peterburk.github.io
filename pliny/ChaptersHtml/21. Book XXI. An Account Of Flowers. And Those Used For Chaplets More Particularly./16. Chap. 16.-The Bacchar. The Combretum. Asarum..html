In former times, it was thepractice to make unguents of this root, as we learn from thepoet Aristophanes, a writer of the Ancient Comedy; fromwhich circumstance some persons have erroneously given thename of "exotic"<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> to the plant. The smell of it strongly resembles that of cinnamomum; and the plant grows in thinsoils, which are free from all humidity.</p><p>The name of "combretum"<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> is given to a plant that bearsa very strong resemblance to it, the leaves of which taper tothe fineness of threads; in height, however, it is taller thanthe bacchar.

Fée. is inclined to coincide with Ruellius, and toidentify this with the Digitalis purpurea, clown's spikenard, or our Lady'sgloves. The only strong objection to this is the fact that the root of thedigitalis has a very faint but disagreeable smell, and not at all like that ofcinnamon. But then, as Fée says, we have no positive proof that the"cinnamomum" of the ancients is identical with our cinnamon. See Vol.iii. p. 138. Sprengel takes the "bacchar" of Virgil to be the ValerianaCeltica, and the "baccharis" of the Greeks to be the Gnaphalium sanguineum, a plant of Egypt and Palestine. The bacchar has been alsoidentified with the Asperula odorata of Linnæus, the Geum urbanum ofLinnæus (the root of which has the smell of cloves), the Inula Vaillantii,the Salvia Sclarea, and many other plants.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Barbaricam."
