<div2 type="chapter" n="24" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 24.—THE MODE OF TESTING THE GOODNESS OF PAPER.</head><p>There is a great difference in the breadth of the variouskinds of paper. That of best quality<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> is thirteen fingers wide,while the hieratica is two fingers less. The Fanniana is tenfingers wide, and that known as "amphitheatrica," one less.The Saitic is of still smaller breadth, indeed it is not sowide as the mallet with which the paper is beaten; and theemporetica is particularly narrow, being not more than sixfingers in breadth.</p><p>In addition to the above particulars, paper is esteemedaccording to its fineness, its stoutness, its whiteness, and itssmoothness. Claudius Cæsar effected a change in that which<pb n="3190" />till then had been looked upon as being of the first quality:for the Augustan paper had been found to be so remarkablyfine, as to offer no resistance to the pressure of the pen; inaddition to which, as it allowed the writing upon it to runthrough, it was continually causing apprehensions of its beingblotted and blurred by the writing on the other side; the remarkable transparency, too, of the paper was very unsightly tothe eye. To obviate these inconveniences, a groundwork ofpaper was made with leaves of the second quality, over whichwas laid a woof, as it were, formed of leaves of the first. Heincreased the width also of paper; the width [of the commonsort] being made a foot, and that of the size known as "macrocollum,"<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> a cubit; though one inconvenience was soon detectedin it, for, upon a single leaf<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> being torn in the press, morepages were apt to be spoilt than before.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> In consequence ofthe advantages above-mentioned, the Claudian has come to bepreferred to all other kinds of paper, though the Augustan isstill used for the purposes of epistolary correspondence. TheLivian, which had nothing in common with that of first quality,but was entirely of a secondary rank, still holds its formerplace.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Augustan.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "long glued" paper: the breadth probably consisted of that oftwo or more sheets glued or pasted at the edges, the seam running downthe roll.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Scheda.

It is not unlikely that his meaning is that thebreadth being doubled, the tearing of one leaf or half breadth entailed ofnecessity the spoiling of another, making the corresponding half breadth.</p></body>
