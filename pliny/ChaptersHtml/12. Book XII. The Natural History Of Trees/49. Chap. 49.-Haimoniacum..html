(23.) Africa, which lies below ®thiopia, distilsa tear-like gum in its sands, called hammoniacum,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> the name ofwhich has passed to the oracle of Hammon, situate near the treewhich produces it. This substance, which is also called metopion,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> bears a strong resemblance to a resin or a gum. Thereare two kinds of ammoniacum; that to which the name isgiven of thrauston, and which bears a resemblance to malefrankincense, being the kind that is the most esteemed, andthat which is known as phyrama, being of an unctuous andresinous nature. This substance is adulterated by means ofsand, which has all the appearance of having adhered to itduring its growth: hence it is greatly preferred when thepieces are extremely small, and in the purest state possible.The price of hammoniacum of the best quality is forty assesper pound.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxiv. c. 14. The gum resin ammoniacum is still importedinto Europe from Africa and the East, in the form of drops or cakes.It is a mildly stimulating expectorant, and is said to be the produce of theDorema ammoniacum. There are still two sorts in commerce: the firstin large masses of a yellow, dirty colour, mingled with heterogeneous substances, and of a plastic consistency. This is the phyrama of Pliny, ormixed ammoniac. The other is in tears, of irregular form and a whitishcolour, brittle and vitreous when broken. This is the thrauston, or"friable" ammoniac of Pliny. Jackson says, that the plant which produces it is common in Morocco, and is called feskouk, resembling a largestalk of fennel The ammoniac of Morocco is not, however, imported intothis country, being too much impregnated with sand, in consequence ofnot being gathered till it falls to the ground.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Solinus tells us, that the tree itself is called Metops.</p></body>
