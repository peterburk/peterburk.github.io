For before their time,Clodius, the son of the tragic actor Æsopus,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> had done the<pb n="2441" />same at Rome; having been left by his father heir to his ample wealth and possessions. Let not Antony then be tooproud, for all his trumvirate, since he can hardly stand in comparison with an actor; one, too, who had no wager to inducehim—a thing which adds to the regal munificence of the act—But was merely desirous of trying, by way of glorificationto his palate, what was the taste of pearls. As he found it tobe wonderfully pleasing, that he might not be the only one toknow it, he had a pearl set before each of his guests for himto swallow. After the surrender of Alexandria, pearls cameinto common and, indeed, universal use at Rome; but theyfirst began to be used about the time of Sylla, though but ofsmall size and of little value, Fenestella says—in this, however, it is quite evident that he is mistaken, for Ælius Stilotells us, that it was in the time of the Jugurthine war, thatthe name of "unio" was first given to pearls of remarkablesize.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Claudius, or Clodius Æsopus, was the most celebrated tragic actor atRome in the time of Cicero, and was probably a freedman of the Clodianfamily. Horace and other authors put him on a level with Roscius.From Cicero we learn that his acting was characterized chiefly by strongemphasis and vehemence. Cicero characterizes him as a "summus artifex," a "consummate artist." He was a firm friend of Cicero, whosecause he advocated indirectly more than once during his banishmentfrom Rome. It appears from Pliny, B. x. c. 72, that he was far fromfrugal, though he left a large fortune to his spendthrift son, ClodiusÆsopus. This man, among his other feats, dissolved in vinegar (or atleast attempted to do so), a pearl worth about £8000, which he took fromthe ear-ring of Cæcilia Metella. It is alluded to by Horace, B. ii. Sat. iii.1. 239.</p></body>
