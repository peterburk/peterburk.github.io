The shavings of this woodwhen briskly planed, always curl up in circles like the tendrilsof the vine. This wood, too, unites particularly well withglue: it is used in this state for making vehicles, and is foundto split sooner in the solid parts than in a place where thepieces have been glued together.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The resistance that woods offer when placed vertically is in the sameratio as that presented by them when employed horizontally. This paragraph is borrowed from Theophrastus, B. iii. c. 4, and B. v. cc. 6, 7, 8.</p></body>
