<div2 type="chapter" n="4" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 4. (3.)—OF NEARER SPAIN.</head><p>The ancient form of the Nearer Spain, like that of manyother provinces, is somewhat changed, since the time whenPompey the Great, upon the trophies which he erected inthe Pyrenees, testified that 877 towns, from the Alps to theborders of the Farther Spain, had been reduced to subjectionby him. The whole province is now divided into seven jurisdictions, those of Carthage<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>, of Tarraco, of Cæsar Augusta<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>, of<pb n="1165" />Clunia<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>, of Asturica<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, of Lucus<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>, and of the Bracari<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>. To theseare to be added the islands, which will be described onanother occasion, as also 293 states which are dependent onothers; besides which the province contains 179 towns. Ofthese, twelve are colonies, thirteen, towns with the rights ofRoman citizens, eighteen with the old Latian rights, oneconfederate, and 135 tributary.</p><p>The first people that we come to on the coast are theBastuli; after whom, proceeding according to the order whichI shall follow, as we go inland, there are the Mentesani, theOretani, and the Carpetani on the Tagus, and next tothem the Vaccæi, the Vectones, and the Celtiberian Arevaci.The towns nearest to the coast are Urci, and Barea<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> includedin Bætica, the district of Mavitania, next to it Deitania, andthen Contestania, and the colony of Carthago Nova; fromthe Promontory of which, known as the Promontorium Saturni<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>, to the city of Cæsarea<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> in Mauritania, the passage isa distance of 187 miles. The remaining objects worthy ofmention on the coast are the river Tader<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>, and the free colonyof Ilici<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>, whence the Ilicitanian Gulf<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> derives its name; tothis colony the Icositani are subordinate.</p><p>We next have Lucentum<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>, holding Latian rights; Dianium<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>,a tributary town; the river Sucro<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>, and in former times atown of the same name, forming the frontier of Contestania.<pb n="1166" />Next is the district of Edetania, with the delightful expanseof a lake<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> before it, and extending backward to Celtiberia.Valentia<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span>, a colony, is situate three miles from the sea, afterwhich comes the river Turium<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span>, and Saguntum<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> at the samedistance, a town of Roman citizens famous for its fidelity,the river Uduba<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span>, and the district of the Ilergaones<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span>. TheIberus<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span>, a river enriched by its commerce, takes its rise inthe country of the Cantabri, not far from the town of Juliobriga<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span>, and flows a distance of 450 miles; 260 of which, fromthe town of Varia<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span> namely, it is available for the purposes ofnavigation. From this river the name of Iberia has beengiven by the Greeks to the whole of Spain.</p><p>Next comes the district of Cossetania, the river Subi<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span>,and the colony of Tarraco, which was built by the Scipios asCarthage<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span> was by the Carthaginians. Then the district of theIlergetes, the town of Subur<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span>, and the river Rubricatum<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span>,beyond which begin the Laletani and the Indigetes<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span>. Behind these, in the order in which they will be mentioned,<pb n="1167" />going back from the foot of the Pyrenees, are the Ausetani<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span>,the Lacetani<span id="ref_31"><a href="#note_31">[31]</a></span>, and along the Pyrenees, the Cerretani<span id="ref_32"><a href="#note_32">[32]</a></span>, next towhom are the Vascones<span id="ref_33"><a href="#note_33">[33]</a></span>. On the coast is the colony ofBarcino<span id="ref_34"><a href="#note_34">[34]</a></span>, surnamed Faventia; Bætulo<span id="ref_35"><a href="#note_35">[35]</a></span> and Iluro<span id="ref_36"><a href="#note_36">[36]</a></span>, towns withRoman citizens; the river Larnum<span id="ref_37"><a href="#note_37">[37]</a></span>, Blandæ<span id="ref_38"><a href="#note_38">[38]</a></span>, the river Alba<span id="ref_39"><a href="#note_39">[39]</a></span>;Emporiæ<span id="ref_40"><a href="#note_40">[40]</a></span>, a city consisting of two parts, one peopled by theoriginal inhabitants, the other by the Greek descendantsof the Phocæans; and the river Ticher<span id="ref_41"><a href="#note_41">[41]</a></span>. From this to theVenus Pyrenæa<span id="ref_42"><a href="#note_42">[42]</a></span>, on the other side of the Promontory, is adistance of forty miles.</p><p>I shall now proceed to give an account of the more remarkable things in these several jurisdictions, in addition tothose which have been already mentioned. Forty-threedifferent peoples are subject to the jurisdiction of the courts ofTarraco: of these the most famous are—holding the rightsof Roman citizens, the Dertusani<span id="ref_43"><a href="#note_43">[43]</a></span> and the Bisgargitani;enjoying Latian rights, the Ausetani, and the Cerretani, bothJulian and Augustan, the Edetani<span id="ref_44"><a href="#note_44">[44]</a></span>, the Gerundenses<span id="ref_45"><a href="#note_45">[45]</a></span>, the<pb n="1168" />Gessorienses<span id="ref_46"><a href="#note_46">[46]</a></span>, and the Teari<span id="ref_47"><a href="#note_47">[47]</a></span>, also called Julienses. Amongthe tributaries are the Aquicaldenses<span id="ref_48"><a href="#note_48">[48]</a></span>, the Onenses, and theBæculonenses<span id="ref_49"><a href="#note_49">[49]</a></span>.</p><p>Cæsar Augusta, a free colony, watered by the river Iberus,on the site of the town formerly called Salduba, is situate inthe district of Edetania, and is the resort of fifty-five nations.Of these there are, with the rights of Roman citizens, theBellitani<span id="ref_50"><a href="#note_50">[50]</a></span>, the Celsenses<span id="ref_51"><a href="#note_51">[51]</a></span>, a former colony, the Calagurritani<span id="ref_52"><a href="#note_52">[52]</a></span>,surnamed the Nassici, the Ilerdenses<span id="ref_53"><a href="#note_53">[53]</a></span>, of the nation of theSurdaones, near whom is the river Sicoris, the Oscenses<span id="ref_54"><a href="#note_54">[54]</a></span> inthe district of Vescitania, and the Turiasonenses<span id="ref_55"><a href="#note_55">[55]</a></span>. Of thoseenjoying the rights of the ancient Latins, there are theCascantenses<span id="ref_56"><a href="#note_56">[56]</a></span> the Ergavicenses<span id="ref_57"><a href="#note_57">[57]</a></span>, the Graccuritani<span id="ref_58"><a href="#note_58">[58]</a></span>, the Leo-<pb n="1169" />nicenses<span id="ref_59"><a href="#note_59">[59]</a></span>, and the Osicerdenses; of federate states, thereare the Tarragenses<span id="ref_60"><a href="#note_60">[60]</a></span>; and of tributaries, the Arcobrigenses<span id="ref_61"><a href="#note_61">[61]</a></span>, the Andologenses<span id="ref_62"><a href="#note_62">[62]</a></span>, the Aracelitani<span id="ref_63"><a href="#note_63">[63]</a></span>, the Bursaonenses<span id="ref_64"><a href="#note_64">[64]</a></span>, the Calagurritani<span id="ref_65"><a href="#note_65">[65]</a></span>, who are also surnamed theFibularenses, the Complutenses<span id="ref_66"><a href="#note_66">[66]</a></span>, the Carenses<span id="ref_67"><a href="#note_67">[67]</a></span>, the Cincenses<span id="ref_68"><a href="#note_68">[68]</a></span>, the Cortonenses, the Damanitani<span id="ref_69"><a href="#note_69">[69]</a></span>, the Larnenses<span id="ref_70"><a href="#note_70">[70]</a></span>, the Lursenses<span id="ref_71"><a href="#note_71">[71]</a></span>, the Lumberitani<span id="ref_72"><a href="#note_72">[72]</a></span>, the Lacetani,the Lubienses, the Pompelonenses<span id="ref_73"><a href="#note_73">[73]</a></span>, and the Segienses.<pb n="1170" /></p><p>Sixty-five different nations resort to Carthage<span id="ref_74"><a href="#note_74">[74]</a></span>, besidesthe inhabitants of the islands. Of the Accitanian<span id="ref_75"><a href="#note_75">[75]</a></span> colony,there are the Gemellenses, and the town of Libisosona<span id="ref_76"><a href="#note_76">[76]</a></span>, surnamed Foroaugustana, to both of which have been grantedItalian<span id="ref_77"><a href="#note_77">[77]</a></span> rights. Of the colony of Salaria<span id="ref_78"><a href="#note_78">[78]</a></span>, there are the peopleof the following towns, enjoying the rights of ancient Latium: the Castulonenses, also called the Cæsari Venales, theSætabitani<span id="ref_79"><a href="#note_79">[79]</a></span> or Augustani, and the Valerienses<span id="ref_80"><a href="#note_80">[80]</a></span>. The bestknown among the tributaries are the Alabanenses<span id="ref_81"><a href="#note_81">[81]</a></span>, the Bastitani<span id="ref_82"><a href="#note_82">[82]</a></span>, the Consaburrenses<span id="ref_83"><a href="#note_83">[83]</a></span>, the Dianenses<span id="ref_84"><a href="#note_84">[84]</a></span>, the Egelestani<span id="ref_85"><a href="#note_85">[85]</a></span>,<pb n="1171" />the Ilorcitani<span id="ref_86"><a href="#note_86">[86]</a></span>, the Laminitani, the Mentesani<span id="ref_87"><a href="#note_87">[87]</a></span>, both thosecalled Oritani and those called Bastuli, and the Oretaniwho are surnamed Germani<span id="ref_88"><a href="#note_88">[88]</a></span>, the people of Segobriga<span id="ref_89"><a href="#note_89">[89]</a></span> thecapital of Celtiberia, those of Toletum<span id="ref_90"><a href="#note_90">[90]</a></span> the capital of Carpetania, situate on the river Tagus, and after them the Viatienses and the Virgilienses<span id="ref_91"><a href="#note_91">[91]</a></span>.</p><p>To the jurisdiction of Clunia<span id="ref_92"><a href="#note_92">[92]</a></span> the Varduli contribute fourteen nations, of whom we need only particularize the Albanenses<span id="ref_93"><a href="#note_93">[93]</a></span>, the Turmodigi<span id="ref_94"><a href="#note_94">[94]</a></span>, consisting of four tribes, amongwhich are the Segisamonenses<span id="ref_95"><a href="#note_95">[95]</a></span> and the Segisamaiulienses.To the same jurisdiction belong the Carietes<span id="ref_96"><a href="#note_96">[96]</a></span> and the Vennenses with five states, among which are the Velienses.Thither too resort the Pelendones of the Celtiberians, infour different nations, among whom the Numantini<span id="ref_97"><a href="#note_97">[97]</a></span> wereespecially famous. Also, among the eighteen states of theVaccæi, there are the Intercatienses<span id="ref_98"><a href="#note_98">[98]</a></span>, the Pallantini<span id="ref_99"><a href="#note_99">[99]</a></span>, theLacobrigenses, and the Caucenses<span id="ref_100"><a href="#note_100">[100]</a></span>. But among the seven<pb n="1172" />peoples belonging to the Cantabri, Juliobriga<span id="ref_101"><a href="#note_101">[101]</a></span> is the onlyplace worthy of mention; and of the ten states of the Autrigones, Tritium and Virovesca<span id="ref_102"><a href="#note_102">[102]</a></span>. The river Areva<span id="ref_103"><a href="#note_103">[103]</a></span> givesits name to the Arevaci; of whom there are six towns, Segontia<span id="ref_104"><a href="#note_104">[104]</a></span> and Uxama<span id="ref_105"><a href="#note_105">[105]</a></span>, names which are frequently given toother places, as also Segovia<span id="ref_106"><a href="#note_106">[106]</a></span> and Nova Augusta, Termes<span id="ref_107"><a href="#note_107">[107]</a></span>,and Clunia itself, the frontier of Celtiberia. The remainingportion turns off towards the ocean, being occupied by theVarduli, already mentioned, and the Cantabri.</p><p>Next upon these touch the twenty-two nations of theAstures, who are divided into the Augustani<span id="ref_108"><a href="#note_108">[108]</a></span> and the Transmontani, with the magnificent city of Asturica. Amongthese we have the Cigurri<span id="ref_109"><a href="#note_109">[109]</a></span>, the Pæsici, the Lancienses<span id="ref_110"><a href="#note_110">[110]</a></span>, andthe Zoëlæ<span id="ref_111"><a href="#note_111">[111]</a></span>. The total number of the free population amountsto 240,000 persons.</p><p>The jurisdiction of Lucus<span id="ref_112"><a href="#note_112">[112]</a></span> embraces, besides the Celticiand the Lebuni, sixteen different nations, but little known<pb n="1173" />and with barbarous names. The number however of the freepopulation amounts to nearly 166,000.</p><p>In a similar manner the twenty-four states of the jurisdiction ofthe Bracari contain a population of 175,000, amongwhom, besides the Bracari<span id="ref_113"><a href="#note_113">[113]</a></span> themselves, we may mention,without wearying the reader, the Bibali, the Cœlerni, theGallæci, the Hequæsi, the Limici, and the Querquerni.</p><p>The length of the Nearer Spain, from the Pyrenees to thefrontier of Castulo, is 607<span id="ref_114"><a href="#note_114">[114]</a></span> miles, and a little more if we followthe line of the coast; while its breadth, from Tarraco tothe shore of Olarson<span id="ref_115"><a href="#note_115">[115]</a></span>, is 307<span id="ref_116"><a href="#note_116">[116]</a></span> miles. From the foot of thePyrenees, where it is wedged in by the near approach of thetwo seas, it gradually expands until it touches the FartherSpain, and thereby acquires a width more than double<span id="ref_117"><a href="#note_117">[117]</a></span>.</p><p>Nearly the whole of Spain abounds in mines<span id="ref_118"><a href="#note_118">[118]</a></span> of lead, iron,<pb n="1174" />copper, silver, and gold; in the Nearer Spain there is alsofound lapis specularis<span id="ref_119"><a href="#note_119">[119]</a></span>; in Bætica there is cinnabar. Thereare also quarries of marble. The Emperor VespasianusAugustus, while still harassed by the storms that agitatedthe Roman state, conferred the Latian rights on the wholeof Spain. The Pyrenean mountains divide Spain from Gaul,their extremities projecting into the two seas on either side.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Nova Carthago or New Carthage, now Carthagena.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Zaragoza or Saragossa, on the right bank of the river Ebro.
