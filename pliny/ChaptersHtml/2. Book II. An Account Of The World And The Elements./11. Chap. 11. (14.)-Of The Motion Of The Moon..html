(14.)ÑOF THE MOTION OF THE MOON.</head><p>It is certain that the moon, having her horns always turnedfrom the sun, when she is waxing, looks towards the east;when she is waning, towards the west. Also, that, from thesecond day after the change, she adds 47 1/2 minutes<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> each day,until she is full, and again decreases at the same rate, andthat she always becomes invisible when she is within 14 degrees of the sun. This is an argument of the greater size ofthe planets than of the moon, since these emerge when theyare at the distance of 7 degrees only<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>. But their altitudecauses them to appear much smaller, as we observe that,during the day, the brightness of the sun prevents thosebodies from being seen which are fixed in the firmament,although they shine then as well as in the night: that thisis the case is proved by eclipses, and by descending into verydeep wells.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In a subsequent part of the work, xviii. 75, the author gives adifferent rate of increase, viz. 51 1/2 minutes; neither of thesenumbers iscorrect; the mean rate of increase being, according to Alexandre, about54? or 55?; Lemaire, ii. 261, 262.
