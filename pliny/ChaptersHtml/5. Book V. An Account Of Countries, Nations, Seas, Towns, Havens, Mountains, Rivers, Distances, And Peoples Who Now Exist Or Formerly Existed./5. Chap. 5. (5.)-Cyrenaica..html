<div2 type="chapter" n="5" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 5. (5.)ÑCYRENAICA.</head><p>The region of Cyrenaica, also called Pentapolis<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>, is renderedfamous by the oracle of Hammon<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>, which is distant400 miles from the city of Cyrene; also by the Fountain of<pb n="1396" />the Sun<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> there, and five cities in especial, those of Berenice<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>,Arsino‘<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>, Ptolemais<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>, Apollonia<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>, and Cyrene<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> itself.Berenice is situate upon the outer promontory that boundsthe Syrtis; it was formerly called the city of the Hesperides(previously mentioned<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>), according to the fables of the<pb n="1397" />Greeks, which very often change their localities. Not farfrom the city, and running before it, is the river Lethon,and with it a sacred grove, where the gardens of the Hesperidesare said to have formerly stood; this city is distantfrom Leptis 375 miles. From Berenice to Arsino‘, commonlycalled Teuchira, is forty-three miles; after which, ata distance of twenty-two, we come to Ptolemais, the ancientname of which was Barce; and at a distance of forty milesfrom this last the Promontory of Phycus<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>, which extends faraway into the Cretan Sea, being 350 miles distant from T¾narum<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>,the promontory of Laconia, and from Crete 225. Afterpassing this promontory we come to Cyrene, which standsat a distance of eleven miles from the sea. From Phycusto Apollonia<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> is twenty-four miles, and from thence to theChersonesus<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> eighty-eight; from which to Catabathmos<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> is adistance of 216 miles. The Marmarid¾<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> inhabit this coast,extending from almost the region of Par¾tonium<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> to theGreater Syrtis; after them the Ararauceles, and then, uponthe coasts of the Syrtis, the Nasamones<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span>, whom the Greeks<pb n="1398" />formerly called Mesammones, from the circumstance oftheir being located in the very midst of sands<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span>. The territoryof Cyrene, to a distance of fifteen miles from the shore,is said to abound in trees, while for the same distancebeyond that district it is only suitable for the cultivation ofcorn: after which, a tract of land, thirty miles in breadthand 250 in length, is productive of nothing but laser [orsilphium<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span>].</p><p>After the Nasamones we come to the dwellings of theAsbyst¾ and the Mac¾<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span>, and beyond them, at eleven days'journey to the west of the Greater Syrtis, the Amantes<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span>, apeople also surrounded by sands in every direction. Theyfind water however without any difficulty at a depth mostlyof about two cubits, as their district receives the overflow ofthe waters of Mauritania. They build houses with blocksof salt<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span>, which they cut out of their mountains just as wedo stone. From this nation to the Troglodyt¾<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span> the distanceis seven days' journey in a south-westerly direction, a peoplewith whom our only intercourse is for the purpose ofprocuring from them the precious stone which we call thecarbuncle, and which is brought from the interior of ®thiopia.Upon the road to this last people, but turning off towardsthe deserts of Africa, of which we have previously<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span> mademention as lying beyond the Lesser Syrtis, is the region ofPhazania<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span>; the nation of Phazanii, belonging to which, as<pb n="1399" />well as the cities of Alele<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span> and Cilliba<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span>, we have subduedby force of arms, as also Cydamus<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span>, which lies over againstSabrata. After passing these places a range of mountainsextends in a prolonged chain from east to west: these havereceived from our people the name of the Black Mountains<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span>,either from the appearance which they naturally bearof having been exposed to the action of fire, or else from thefact that they have been scorched by the reflection of thesun's rays. Beyond it<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span> is the desert, and then Talg¾, a city ofthe Garamantes, and Debris, at which place there is a spring<span id="ref_31"><a href="#note_31">[31]</a></span>,the waters of which, from noon to midnight, are at boilingheat, and then freeze for as many hours until the followingnoon; Garama too, that most famous capital of the Garamantes;all which places have been subdued by the Romanarms. It was on this occasion that Cornelius Balbus<span id="ref_32"><a href="#note_32">[32]</a></span> washonoured with a triumph, the only foreigner indeed that wasever honoured with the triumphal chariot, and presentedwith the rights of a Roman citizen; for, although by birtha native of Gades, the Roman citizenship was granted to himas well as to the elder Balbus<span id="ref_33"><a href="#note_33">[33]</a></span>, his uncle by the father's side.There is also this remarkable circumstance, that our writers<pb n="1400" />have handed down to us the names of the cities above-men-tioned as having been taken by Balbus, and have informedus that on the occasion of his triumph<span id="ref_34"><a href="#note_34">[34]</a></span>, besides Cydamusand Garama<span id="ref_35"><a href="#note_35">[35]</a></span>, there were carried in the procession thenames and models of all the other nations and cities, inthe following order: the town of Tabudium<span id="ref_36"><a href="#note_36">[36]</a></span>, the nationof Niteris, the town of Nigligemella, the nation or town ofBubeium<span id="ref_37"><a href="#note_37">[37]</a></span>, the nation of Enipi, the town of Thuben, themountain known as the Black Mountain, Nitibrum, thetowns called Rapsa, the nation of Discera<span id="ref_38"><a href="#note_38">[38]</a></span>, the town ofDebris<span id="ref_39"><a href="#note_39">[39]</a></span>, the river Nathabur<span id="ref_40"><a href="#note_40">[40]</a></span>, the town of Thapsagum<span id="ref_41"><a href="#note_41">[41]</a></span>,the nation of Nannagi, the town of Boin, the town ofPege<span id="ref_42"><a href="#note_42">[42]</a></span>, the river Dasibari; and then the towns, in thefollowing order, of Baracum, Buluba, Alasit, Galia, Balla,Maxalla<span id="ref_43"><a href="#note_43">[43]</a></span>, Zizama, and Mount Gyri<span id="ref_44"><a href="#note_44">[44]</a></span>, which was preceded by<pb n="1401" />an inscription stating that this was the place where preciousstones were produced.</p><p>Up to the present time it has been found impracticableto keep open the road that leads to the country of theGaramantes, as the predatory bands of that nation have filledup the wells with sand, which do not require to be dug forto any great depth, if you only have a knowledge of thelocality. In the late war<span id="ref_45"><a href="#note_45">[45]</a></span> however, which, at the beginningof the reign of the Emperor Vespasian, the Romans carriedon with the people of Îa, a short cut of only four days'journey was discovered; this road is known as the "P¾terCaput Saxi<span id="ref_46"><a href="#note_46">[46]</a></span>." The last place in the territory of Cyrenaicais Catabathmos, consisting of a town, and a valley with asudden and steep descent. The length of Cyrenean Africa,up to this boundary from the Lesser Syrtis, is 1060 miles;and, so far as has been ascertained, it is 800<span id="ref_47"><a href="#note_47">[47]</a></span> in breadth.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">So called, as mentioned below, from its five principal cities.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Where Jupiter Ammon or Hammon was worshiped under the form of a ram, the form he was said to have assumed when the deities were dispersed in the war with the Giants. Ancient Ammonium is the present oasis of Siwah in the Libyan Desert.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The same that has been already mentioned in B. ii. c. 106. It is mentioned by Herodotus and Pomponius Mela.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Previously called Hesperis or Hesperides. It was the most westerly city of Cyrenaica, and stood just beyond the eastern extremity of the Greater Syrtis, on a promontory called Pseudopenias, and near the river Lethon. Its historical importance only dates from the times of the Ptolemies, when it was named Berenice, after the wife of Ptolemy III. or Euergetes. Having been greatly reduced, it was fortified anew by the Emperor Justinian. Its ruins are to be seen at the modern Ben Ghazi.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">So called from Arsino‘, the sister of Ptolemy Philadelphus. Its earlier name was Taucheira or Teucheira, which name, according to Marcus, it still retains.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Its ruins may still be seen at Tolmeita or Tolometa. It was situate on the N.W. coast of Cyrenaica, and originally bore the name of Barca. From which of the Ptolemies it took its name is not known. Its splendid ruins are not less than four miles in circumference.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Its ruins are still to be seen, bespeaking its former splendour, at the modern Marsa Sousah. It was originally only the port of Cyrene, but under the Ptolemies it flourished to such an extent as to eclipse that city. It is pretty certain that it was the Sozusa of the later Greek writers. Eratosthenes was a native of this place.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The chief city of Cyrenaica, and the most important Hellenic colony in Africa, the early settlers having extensively intermarried with wives of Libyan parentage. In its most prosperous times it maintained an extensive commerce with Greece and Egypt, especially in silphium or assafÏtida, the plantations of which, as mentioned in the present chapter, extended for miles in its vicinity. Great quantities of this plant were also exported to Capua in Southern Italy, where it was extensively employed in the manufacture of perfumes. The scene of the 'Rudens,' the most picturesque (if we may use the term) of the plays of Plautus, is laid in the vicinity of Cyrene, and frequent reference is made in it to the extensive cultivation of silphium; a head of which plant also appears on the coins of the place. The philosophers Aristippus and Carneades were born here, as also the poet Callimachus. Its ruins, at the modern Ghrennah, are very extensive, and are indicative of its former splendour.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In C. 1 of the present Book. It was only the poetical fancy of the Greeks that found the fabled gardens of the Hesperides in the fertile regions of Cyrenaica. Scylax distinctly mentions the gardens and the lake of the Hesperides in this vicinity, where we also find a people called Hesperid¾, or, as Herodotus names them, Euesperid¾. It was probably in consequence of this similarity of name, in a great degree, that the gardens of the Hesperidcs were assigned to this locality.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called Ras-Sem or Ras-El-Kazat. It is situate a little to the west of Apollonia and N.W. of Cyrene.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">According to Ansart, 264 miles is the real distance between Capes Ras-Sem and T¾narum or Matapan.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">As already mentioned, Apollonia formed the harbour of Cyrene.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This was called the Chersonesus Magna, being so named in contradistinction to the Chersonesus Parva, on the coast of Egypt, about thirty-five miles west of Alexandria. It is now called Ras-El-Tin, or more commonly Raxatin.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">So called from the peculiar features of the locality, the Greek word <foreign lang="greek">katabaqmo\s,</foreign> signifying "a descent." A deep valley, bounded east and west by ranges of high hills, runs from this spot to the frontiers of Egypt. It is again mentioned by Pliny at the end of the present Chapter. The spot is still known by a similar name, being called Marsa Sollern, or the "Port of the Ladder." In earlier times the Egyptian territory ended at the Gulf of Plinthinethes, now Lago Segio, and did not extend so far as Catabathmos.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This name was unknown to Herodotus. As Marcus observes, it was probably of PhÏnician origin, signifying "leading a wandering life," like the term "nomad," derived from the Greek.</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called El Bareton or Marsa-Labeit. This city was of considerable importance, and belonged properly to Marmaria, but was included politically in the Nomos Libya of Egypt. It stood near the promontory of Artos or Pythis, now Ras-El-Hazeit.</p><p><span id="note_17"><a href="#ref_17">17. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">So called from the words <hi rend="ital">Matž-Ammon,</hi> "the tribe of Ammon," according to Bochart. The Nasamones were a powerful but savage people of Libya, who dwelt originally on the shores of the Greater Syrtis, but were driven inland by the Greek settlers of Cyrenaica, and afterwards by the Romans.</p><p><span id="note_18"><a href="#ref_18">18. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From <foreign lang="greek">meso\s</foreign> "the middle," and <foreign lang="greek">a)/mmos</foreign> "sand."</p><p><span id="note_19"><a href="#ref_19">19. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See note<hi rend="super">6</hi> in p. 396.</p><p><span id="note_20"><a href="#ref_20">20. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Herodotus places this nation to the west of the Nasamones and on the river Cinyps, now called the Wadi-Quaham.</p><p><span id="note_21"><a href="#ref_21">21. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In most of the editions they are called 'Hammanientes.'

Pliny has used the term already (B. iv. c. 25) in reference to the nations on the banks of the Danube. It was a general name applied by the Greek geographers to various uncivilized races who had no abodes but caves, and more especially to the inhabitants of the western coasts of the Red Sea, along the shores of Upper Egypt and ®thiopia.</p><p><span id="note_24"><a href="#ref_24">24. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">At the beginning of C. 4.</p><p><span id="note_25"><a href="#ref_25">25. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Which gives name to the modern Fezzan.</p><p><span id="note_26"><a href="#ref_26">26. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called Tanet-Mellulen, or the station of Mellulen, on the route from Gadamez to Oserona.</p><p><span id="note_27"><a href="#ref_27">27. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Zaouila or Zala, half way between Augyla and Mourzouk.</p><p><span id="note_28"><a href="#ref_28">28. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Gadamez, which, according to Marcus, is situate almost under the same meridian as Old Tripoli, the ancient Sabrata.</p><p><span id="note_29"><a href="#ref_29">29. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">According to Marcus this range still bears the name of Gibel-Assoud, which in the Arabic language means the "Black Mountain."</p><p><span id="note_30"><a href="#ref_30">30. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In a southerly direction. He alludes probably to the Desert of Bildulgerid.</p><p><span id="note_31"><a href="#ref_31">31. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This spring is also mentioned by Pliny in B. ii. c. 106. Marcus suggests that the Debris of Pliny is the same as the Bedir of Ptolemy. He also remarks that the English traveller Oudney discovered caverns hewn out of the sides of the hills, evidently for the purposes of habitation, but of which the use is not known by the present people. These he considers to have been the abodes of the ancient Troglodyt¾ or "cave-dwellers." In the Tibesti range of mountains, however, we find a race called the Rock Tibboos, from the circumstance of their dwelling in caves.</p><p><span id="note_32"><a href="#ref_32">32. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cornelius Balbus Gaditanus the Younger, who, upon his victories over the Garamantes, obtained a triumph in the year B.C. <date value="-19" authname="-19">19</date>.</p><p><span id="note_33"><a href="#ref_33">33. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">L. Cornelius Balbus the Elder, also at native of Gades. He obtained the consulship in B.C. <date value="-40" authname="-40">40</date>, the first instance, as we find mentioned by Pliny, B. vii. c. 44, in which this honour had been conferred upon one who was not a Roman citizen.</p><p><span id="note_34"><a href="#ref_34">34. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">On the occasion of a triumph by a Roman general, boards were carried aloft on "fercula," on which were painted in large letters the names of vanquished nations and countries. Here too models were exhibited in ivory or wood of the cities and forts captured, and pictures of the mountains, rivers, and other great natural features of the subjugated region, with appropriate inscriptions. Marcus is of opinion that the names of the places here mentioned do not succeed in any geographical order, but solely according to their presumed importance as forming part of the conquest of Balbus. He also thinks that Balbus did not penetrate beyond the fifteenth degree of north latitude, and that his conquests did not extend so far south as the banks of Lake Tchad.</p><p><span id="note_35"><a href="#ref_35">35. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The site of Garama still bears the name of 'Gherma,' and presents very considerable remains of antiquity.

Marcus suggests that this is the Gibel-Gelat or Rock of Gelat spoken of by the English travellers Denham, Clapperton, and Oudney, forming a portion of the chain of Guriano or Gyr. He says, that at the foot of this mountain travellers have to pass from Old and New Tripoli on their road to Missolat, the Maxala of Pliny, and thence to Gerama or Gherma, the ancient capital of Fezzan.</p><p><span id="note_47"><a href="#ref_47">47. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">As Marcus observes, this would not make it to extend so far south as the sixteenth degree of north latitude.</p></body>
