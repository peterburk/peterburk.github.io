<div2 type="chapter" n="75" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 75. (32.)ÑTHE REVOLUTIONS OF THE MOON.</head><p>I shall now proceed to add some necessary information re-lative to the moon, the winds, and certain signs and prognostics, inorder that I may complete the observations I have tomake with reference to the sidereal system. Virgil<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> has evengone so far, in imitation of Democritus, as to assign certainoperations to certain days<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> of the moon; but my sole objectshall be, as, indeed, it has been throughout this work, to consultthat utility which is based upon a knowledge andappreciation of general principles.</p><p>All vegetable productions are cut, gathered, and housed tomore advantage while the moon is on the wane than while itis on the increase. Manure must never be touched exceptwhen the moon is on the wane; and land must be manuredmore particularly while the moon is in conjunction, or else atthe first quarter. Take care to geld your boars, bulls, rams,and kids, while the moon is on the wane. Put eggs under thehen at a new moon. Make your ditches in the night-time,when the moon is at full. Cover up the roots of trees, whilethe moon is at full. Where the soil is humid, put in seed<pb n="4112" />at the moon's conjunction, and during the four days aboutthat period. It is generally recommended, too, to give an airingto corn and the leguminous grains, and to garner them, towardsthe end of the moon; to make seed-plots when the moonis above the horizon; and to tread out the grape, to fell timber, andto do many other things that have been mentionedin their respective places, when the moon is below it.</p><p>The observation of the moon, in general, as already observed inthe Second Book,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> is not so very easy, but what Iam about here to state even rustics will be able to comprehend:so long as the moon is seen in the west, and during the earlierhours of the night, she will be on the increase, and one halfof her disk will be perceived; but when the moon is seen torise at sun-set and opposite to the sun, so that they are bothperceptible at the same moment, she will be at fall. Again,as often as the moon rises in the east, and does not give herlight in the earlier hours of the night, but shows herselfduring a portion of the day, she will be on the wane, and onehalf of her only will again be perceptible: when the moon hasceased to be visible, she is in conjunction, a period known tous as "interlunium."<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> During the conjunction, the moon willhe above the horizon the same time as the sun, for the wholeof the first day: on the second, she will advance upon thenight ten-twelfths of an hour and one-fourth of a twelfth;<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>on the third day, the same as on the second, and * * * so onin succession up to the fifteenth day, the same proportional partsof an hour being added each day. On the fifteenth day she willbe above the horizon all night, and below it all day. On thesixteenth, she will remain below the horizon ten-twelfths ofan hour, and one-fourth of a twelfth, at the first hour of thenight, and so on in the same proportion day after day, up tothe period of her conjunction; and thus, the same time whichby remaining under the horizon, she withdraws from the firstpart of the night, she will add to the end of the night byremaining above the horizon. Her revolutions, too, willoccupy thirty days one month, and twenty-nine the next, andso on alternately. Such is the theory of the revolutions ofthe moon.<pb n="4113" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Georg. i. 276.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In contradistinction to the two periods of full moon, and change ofthe moon, the only epochs in reference to it noticed by Pliny.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In Chapters 6. 7, 8 and 11.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "between moons."
