They differ from eachother in this respect, that the <hi rend="ital">faces</hi> produce a long train oflight, the fore-part only being on fire; while the <hi rend="ital">bolides,</hi> beingentirely in a state of combustion, leave a still longer trackbehind them.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The terms "faces," "lampades," "bolides," and "trabes," literallytorches, lamps, darts, and beams, which are employed to express differentkinds of meteors, have no corresponding words in English which wouldcorrectly designate them.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From this account it would appear, that the "fax" was what weterm a falling star.
