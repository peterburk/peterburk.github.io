<div2 type="chapter" n="54" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 54. (36.)—BEARS AND THEIR CUBS.</head><p>Bears couple in the beginning of winter,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and not after thefashion of other quadrupeds; for both animals lie down and embrace each other.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> The female then retires by herself to a separate den, and there brings forth on the thirtieth day, mostlyfive young ones. When first born, they are shapeless masses ofwhite flesh, a little larger than mice;<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> their claws alone being<pb n="2306" />prominent. The mother then licks them gradually into propershape. There is nothing more uncommon than to see a she-bear in the act of parturition.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> The male remains in hisretreat for forty days, the female four months. If theyhappen to have no den, they construct a retreat with branchesand shrubs, which is made impenetrable to the rain and islined with soft leaves. During the first fourteen days they areovercome by so deep a sleep, that they cannot be aroused bywounds even. They become wonderfully fat, too, while in thislethargic state. This fat is much used in medicine; and it isvery useful in preventing the hair from falling off.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> At the endof these fourteen days they sit up, and find nourishment bysucking their fore-paws.<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> They warm their cubs, when cold,by pressing them to the breast, not unlike the way in whichbirds brood over their eggs. It is a very astonishing thing, butTheophrastus believes it, that if we preserve the flesh of thebear, the animal being killed in its dormant state, it will increase in bulk, even though it may have been cooked.<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> Duringthis period no signs of food are to be found in the stomachof the animal, and only a very slight quantity of liquid; thereare a few drops of blood only near the heart, but none whatever in any other part of the body.<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> They leave their retreatin the spring, the males being remarkably fat: of this circumstance, however, we cannot give any satisfactory explanation, for the sleep, during which they increase so much in bulk,lasts, as we have already stated, only fourteen days.<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> Whenthey come out, they eat a certain plant, which is known as<pb n="2307" />aros,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> in order to relax the bowels, which would otherwisebecome in a state of constipation; and they sharpen the edgesof their teeth against the young shoots of the trees. Theireye-sight is dull, for which reason in especial, they seek thecombs of bees, in order that from the bees stinging them inthe throat and drawing blood, the oppression in the head maybe relieved.<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> The head of the bear is extremely weak, whereas,in the lion, it is remarkable for its strength: on which accountit is, that when the bear, impelled by any alarm, is about toprecipitate itself from a rock, it covers its head with its paws.In the arena of the Circus they are often to be seen killed bya blow on the head with the fist. The people of Spain havea belief, that there is some kind of magical poison in the brainof the bear, and therefore burn the heads of those that havebeen killed in their public games; for it is averred, that thebrain, when mixed with drink, produces in man the rage ofthe bear.<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> These animals walk on two feet, and climb downtrees backwards.<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> They can overcome the bull, by suspendingthemselves, by all four legs, from its muzzle and horns, thuswearing out its powers by their weight. In no other animalis stupidity found more adroit in devising mischief. It is re-corded in our Annals, that on the fourteenth day before thecalends of October,<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> in the consulship of M. Piso and M. Messala, Domitius Ahenobarbus, the curule ædile, brought intothe Circus one hundred Numidian bears, and as many Æthiopian hunters. I am surprised to find the word Numilianadded, seeing that it is well known that there are no bears produced in Africa.<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span><pb n="2308" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier remarks, that this account of the bear is generally correct; hepoints out, however, certain errors, which will be duly noticed. Ælian,Anim. Nat. B. vi. c. 3, gives an account of the parturition of the bear.—B.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This description of their mode of coupling, though from Aristotle,Hist. Anim. B. vi. c. 30, is not correct. Buffon and other naturalistsassure us that they do not differ herein from other quadrupeds.—B.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle says, that the cubs are born blind, without hair, and that their limbs are ill formed, which is correct; but the account here given isgreatly exaggerated.—B.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">As the birth takes place when the mother is in her winter retreat, itcan have been witnessed only when in the menagerie.—B.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is referred to in B. xxviii. c. 46; this property of the fat of thebear is also mentioned by Galen and by Dioscorides, and it still retains itsplace among our popular remedies; but it is difficult to conceive that it canhave any virtue above other fatty substances of the same consistence.—B.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This, which appears to be a vulgar error, is mentioned by Aristotle,Hist.

B. ii.—B.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We have a somewhat similar account in the treatise De Mirab.Auscult. p <date value="1155" authname="1155">1155</date>.—B.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably from Aristotle, <hi rend="ital">ubi supra.—B.</hi></p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This apparent anomaly has been attempted to be explained, by supposing that the bears lay up a plentiful store of provisions in their winterretreats, which they consume while they remain without exercise.—B.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny enumerates, at considerable length, the varieties of aros, in B.xxiv. c. 92; it is also described in B. xix. c. 30; it is probably a speciesof arum.—B.
