<div2 type="chapter" n="57" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 57. (13.)—CÆRULEUM.</head><p>Cæruleum<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> is a kind of sand. In former times there werethree kinds of it; the Egyptian, which was the most esteemedof all; the Scythian, which is easily dissolved, and whichproduces four colours when pounded, one of a lighter blueand one of a darker blue, one of a thicker consistency andone comparatively thin;<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and the Cyprian, which is now preferredas a colour to the preceding. Since then, the kindsimported from Puteoli and Spain have been added to the list,this sand having of late been prepared there. Every kind,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span><pb n="6142" />however, is submitted to a dyeing process, it being boiled witha plant<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> used particularly for this purpose,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> and imbibing itsjuices. In other respects, the mode of preparing it is similarto that of chrysocolla. From cæruleum, too, is prepared thesubstance known as "lomentum,"<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> it being washed andground for the purpose. Lomentum is of a paler tint thancæruleum; the price of it is ten denarii per pound, and thatof cæruleum but eight. Cæruleum is used upon a surfaceof clay, for upon lime it will not hold. A more recentinvention is the Vestorian<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> cæruleum, so called from theperson who first manufactured it: it is prepared from the finerparts of Egyptian cæruleum, and the price of it is elevendenarii per pound. That of Puteoli is used in a similarmanner,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> as also for windows:<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> it is known as "cylon."<pb n="6143" /></p><p>It is not so long since that indicum<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> was first imported toRome, the price being seventeen<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> denarii per pound. Paintersmake use of it for incisures, or in other words, the division ofshadows from light. There is also a lomentum of very inferiorquality, known to us as "ground" lomentum, and valuedat only five asses per pound.</p><p>The mode of testing the genuineness of cæruleum, is to seewhether it emits a flame, on being laid upon burning coals.One method of adulterating it is to boil dried violets in water,and then to strain the liquor through linen into Eretrian<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>clay.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"It is possible that the 'cæruleum' of the ancients may in some caseshave been real ultramarine, but properly and in general, it was only copperochre."—Beckmann's Hist.

"Pliny clearly adds to it an artificial colour, which in myopinion was made in the same manner as our lake; for he speaks of anearth, which when boiled with plants, acquired their blue colour."—Hist.Inv., Vol. II. p. 480.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Supposed by Hardouin to have been "glastum" or "woad," the Isatistinctoria of Linnæus, mentioned in B. xxii. c. 2.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"In suâ coquitur herbâ."</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A blue powder; see Chapter 27 of this Book. Beckmann has thefollowing remarks on this and the preceding lines: "The well-knownpassage of Pliny in which Lehmann thinks he can with certainty discovercobalt, is so singular a medley that nothing to be depended on can begathered from it. The author, it is true, where he treats of mineral pigments,seems to speak of a blue sand which produced different shades ofblue paint, according as it was pounded coarser or finer. The palest powderwas called lomentum, and this Lehmann considers as our powder-blue. Iam, however, fully convinced that the <hi rend="ital">cyanus</hi> of Theophrastus, the <hi rend="ital">cæruleum</hi>of Pliny, and the <hi rend="ital">chrysocolla</hi> (see Chapter 26), were the blue copper earthalready mentioned, which may have been mixed and blended together."—Hist. Inv. Vol. I. pp. 480, 481. <hi rend="ital">Bohn's Edition.</hi></p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">According to Vitruvius, B. vii. c. 11, the manufactory of Vestoriuswas at Puteoli, now Pozzuoli. This was probably the same C. Vestoriuswho was also a money-lender and a friend of Atticus, and with whomCicero had monetary transactions. He is mentioned as "Vestorium meum,"in the Epistles of Cicero to Atticus.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">For colouring surfaces of clay or cretaceous earth. This kind was alsomanufactured by Vesturius, most probably.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Idem et Puteolani usus, præterque ad fenestras." "The expressionhere, <hi rend="ital">usus ad fenestras,</hi> has been misapplied by Lehmann, as a strong proofof his assertion; for he explained it as if Pliny had said that a blue pigmentwas used for painting window-frames; but glass windows were atthat time unknown. I suspect that Pliny meant to say only that onekind of paint could not be employed near openings which afforded a passage to the light, as it soon decayed and lost its colour. This wouldhave been the case in particular with <hi rend="ital">lake,</hi> in which there was a mixture ofvegetable particles."—Beckmann, Hist. Inv. Vol. I. p. 480.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Indian" pigment. Probably our "indigo." It is again mentioned,and at greater length, in B. xxxv. c. 27. See also Beckmann, Hist.Inv.
