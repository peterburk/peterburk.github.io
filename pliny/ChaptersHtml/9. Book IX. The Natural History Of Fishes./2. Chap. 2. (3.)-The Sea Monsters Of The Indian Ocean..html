<div2 type="chapter" n="2" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 2. (3.)ÑTHE SEA MONSTERS OF THE INDIAN OCEAN.</head><p>But the most numerous and largest of all these animals arethose found in the Indian seas; among which there are bal¾n¾,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>four jugera<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> in extent, and the pristis,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> two hundred cubits<pb n="2360" />long: here also are found cray-fish<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> four cubits in length, andin the river Ganges there are to be seen eels three hundred<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>feet long. But at sea it is more especially about the time ofthe solstices that these monsters are to be seen. For thenit is that in these regions the whirlwind comes sweeping on,the rains descend, the hurricane comes rushing down, hurledfrom the mountain heights, while the sea is stirred up from thevery bottom, and the monsters are driven from their depthsand rolled upwards on the crest of the billow. At other timesagain, there are such vast multitudes of tunnies met with, thatthe fleet of Alexander the Great was able to make head againstthem only by facing them in order of battle, just as it wouldhave done an enemy's fleet. Had the ships not done this,but proceeded in a straggling manner, they could not possiblyhave made their escape. No noises, no sounds, no blows hadany effect on these fish; by nothing short of the clash of battlewere they to be terrified, and by nothing less than their utterdestruction were they overpowered.</p><p>There is a large peninsula in the Red Sea, known by thename of Cadara:<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> as it projects into the deep it forms a vastgulf, which it took the fleet of King Ptolemy<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> twelve wholedays and nights to traverse by dint of rowing, for not a breathof wind was to be perceived. In the recesses of this becalmed spot more particularly, the sea-monsters attain so vasta size that they are quite unable to move. The commanders of the fleets of Alexander the Great have related thatthe Gedrosi,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> who dwell upon the banks of the river Ara-<pb n="2361" />bis,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> are in the habit of making the doors of their houses withthe jaw-bones<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> of fishes, and raftering the roofs with their bones,many of which were found as much as forty cubits in length.At this place, too, the sea-monsters, just like so many cattle,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>were in the habit of coming on shore, and, after feeding on theroots of shrubs, they would return; some of them, which hadthe heads of horses,<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> asses, and bulls, found a pasture in thecrops of grain.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is not accurately known what fish was meant by the ancients, underthe name of "bal¾na." According to some writers, it is considered to bethe same with what we call the "grampus."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A space, as Hardouin remarks, greater than that occupied by sometowns, the "jugerum" being 240 feet long, and 120 broad. The vast sizeof great fishes was a favourite subject with some of the ancient writers,and their accounts were eagerly copied by some of the early fathers.Bochart has collected these various accounts in his work on Animals, B. i.c. 7. In the "Arabian Nights" also, we find accounts of huge fishes inthe eastern seas, so large as to be taken for islands. The existence of thesea-serpent is still a question in dispute; and a whale of large size, is aformidable obstacle in the way of a ship of even the largest burthen.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">As Hardouin remarks, we can learn neither from the works of Pliny,nor yet of ®lian, what fish the pristis really was. From Nonius Marcellus, c. 13, we find that it was a very long fish of large size, but narrow body. Hardouin says that it was a fish of the cetaceous kind, found in theIndian seas, which, in his time, was known by some as the "vivella," witha long bony muzzle serrated on either side, evidently meaning the sawfish. Pristis was a favourite name given by the Romans to their ships.In the boat-race described by Virgil in the ®neid, B. v., one of the boatsis so called.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier remarks, that he himself had often seen the "langouste," orlarge lobster, as much as four feet in length, and the "homard," usually asmaller kind, of an equal size. The length, however, given by Plinywould make six or eight feet, according to the length of the cubit.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier says, that it is an exaggeration by travellers, which there isnothing in nature at all to justify. Probably, however, some animals ofthe genus boa, or python, or large water-snakes may have given rise tothe story.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">On the southern coast of Arabia.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ptolemy Philadelphus.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. vi. c. 23, 25. Strabo, in his fifteenth Book, tells the same storyof the Ichthyophagi, situate between the Carmani and the Orit¾. Dalechamps suggests that the Gedrosi mentioned this in relation to theIchthyophagi, who were probably their neighbours.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Also called the Cophetes. See B. vi. c. 25. The commander ofAlexander's fleet more especially alluded to, is probably Nearchus, whowrote an account of his voyage, to which Pliny has previously made allusion in B. vi. and which is followed by Strabo, in B. xv., and by Arrian, inhis "Indica."</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hardouin remarks, that the Basques of his day were in the habit offencing their gardens with the ribs of the whale, which sometimes exceeded twenty feet in length; and Cuvier says, that at the present time, thejaw-bone of the whale is used in Norway for the purpose of making beamsor posts for buildings.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Onesicritus, quoted by Strabo, B. xv., says., that in the vicinity ofTaprobane, or Ceylon, there were animals which had an amphibious life,some of which resembled oxen, some horses, and various other land animals.Cuvier is of opinion, that not improbably tie "Trichecum manatum" andthe "Trichecum dugong" of Linn¾us are alluded to, which are herbivorousanimals, though nearly allied to the cetacea, and which are in the habit ofcoming to pasture on the grass or sea-weed they may chance to find on theshore.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is remarked by Cuvier, that there is no resemblance whatever between the domesticated animals and any of the cetacea; but that theimagination of the vulgar has pictured to itself these supposed resemblances, by the aid of a lively imagination.</p></body>
