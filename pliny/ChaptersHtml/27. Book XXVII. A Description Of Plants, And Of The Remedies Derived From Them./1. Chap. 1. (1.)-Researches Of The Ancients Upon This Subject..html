<div2 type="chapter" n="1" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 1. (1.)—RESEARCHES OF THE ANCIENTS UPON THISSUBJECT.</head><p>THE further I proceed in this work, the more I am impressedwith admiration of the ancients; and the greater the numberof plants that remain to be described, the more I am inducedto venerate the zeal displayed by the men of former times intheir researches, and the kindly spirit manifested by them intransmitting to us the results thereof. Indeed their bounteousness in this respect would almost seem to have surpassed themunificent disposition even of Nature herself, if our knowledgeof plants had depended solely upon man's spirit of discovery:but as it is, it is evident beyond all doubt that this knowledgehas emanated from the gods themselves, or, at all events, hasbeen the result of divine inspiration, even in those cases whereman has been instrumental in communicating it to us. Inother words, if we must confess the truth—a marvel surpassedby nothing in our daily experience—Nature herself, thatcommon parent of all things, has at once produced them, andhas discovered to us their properties.</p><p>Wondrous indeed is it, that a Scythian<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> plant should bebrought from the shores of the Palus Mæotis, and the euphorbia<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> from Mount Atlas and the regions beyond the Pillars ofHercules, localities where the operations of Nature have reachedtheir utmost limit! That in another direction, the plantbritannica<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> should be conveyed to us from isles of theOcean situate beyond the confines of the earth!<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> That theæthiopis<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> should reach us from a climate scorched by the<pb n="5218" />luminaries of heaven! And then, in addition to all this, thatthere should be a perpetual interchange going on between allparts of the earth, of productions so instrumental to the welfareof mankind! Results, all of them, ensured to us by the peacethat reigns under the majestic sway of the Roman power, apeace which brings in presence of each other, not individualsonly, belonging to lands and nations far separate, but mountains even, and heights towering above the clouds, their plantsand their various productions! That this great bounteousnessof the gods may know no end, is my prayer, a bounteousnesswhich seems to have granted the Roman sway as a secondluminary for the benefit of mankind.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He alludes to the Glycyrrhiza or Scythice, our Liquorice, which isstill found on the banks of the river Volga.
