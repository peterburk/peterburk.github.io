It is a well-known factalso, that marks, moles, and even scars, are reproduced in members of the same family in successive generations. The markwhich the Daci make on their arms for the purpose of denoting their origin, is known to last even to the fourth generation.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span></p><p>(12.) We have heard it stated that three members of thefamily of the Lepidi have been born, though not in an uninterrupted succession, with one of the eyes covered with amembrane.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> We observe, too, that some children strongly resemble their grandfather, and that of twins one child is like thefather, while the other resembles the mother; and have knowncases where a child that was born a year after another, resembled him as exactly as though they had been twins. Somewomen have children like themselves, some like their husband,while others again bear children who resemble neither theone nor the other. In some cases the female children resemblethe father, and the males the mother. The case of Nic¾us,the celebrated wrestler of Byzantium, is a well-known and un-<pb n="2146" />doubted instance. His mother was the produce of an act ofadultery, committed with a male of ®thiopia; and althoughshe herself differed in no way from the ordinary complexionof other females, he was born with all the swarthy complexion of his ®thiopian grandfather.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span></p><p>These strong features of resemblance proceed, no doubt, fromthe imagination of the parents, over which we may reasonablybelieve that many casual circumstances have a very powerfulinfluence; such, for instance, as the action of the eyes, theears, or the memory, or impressions received at the moment ofconception. A thought<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> even, momentarily passing throughthe mind of either of the parents, may be supposed to producea resemblance to one of them separately, or else to the twocombined. Hence it is that the varieties are much more numerous in the appearance of man than in that of other animals; seeing that, in the former, the rapidity of the ideas, thequickness of the perception, and the varied powers of the intellect, tend to impress upon the features peculiar and diversifiedmarks; while in the case of the other animals, the mind isimmovable, and just the same in each and all individuals ofthe same species.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> A man named Artemon, one of the commonpeople,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> bore so strong a resemblance to Antiochus, the kingof Syria, that his queen Laodice, after her husband Antiochuswas slain, acted the farce of getting this man<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> to recommend<pb n="2147" />her as the successor to the crown. Vibius, a member of theplebeian order,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> and Publieius as well, a freedman who hadformerly been a slave, so strongly resembled Pompeius Magnusin appearance as to be scarcely distinguishable from him; theyboth had that ingenuous countenance<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> of his, and that fineforehead,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> which so strongly bespoke his noble descent. Itwas a similar degree of resemblance to this, that caused thesurname of his cook, Menogenes, to be given to the fatherof Pompeius Magnus, he having already obtained that ofStrabo, on account of the cast in his eye,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> a defect which hehad contracted through imitating a similar one in his slave.Scipio, too, had the name of Serapion given him, after the vileslave of a pig-jobber: and after him, another Scipio of thesame family was surnamed Salvitto, after a mime<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> of thatname. In the same way, too, Spinther and Pamphilus, whowere respectively actors of only second and third rate parts,gave their names to Lentulus and Metellus, who were at thattime colleagues in the consulship; so that, by a very curiousbut disagreeable coincidence, the likenesses of the two consulswere to be seen at the same moment on the stage.</p><p>On the other hand again, L. Plancus, the orator, bestowedhis surname on the actor Rubrius: the player, Burbuleius,again, gave his name to the elder Curio, and the player, Menogenes, to Messala, the censor.<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> There was a certain fisherman, too, a native of Sicily, who bore a strong resemblance tothe proconsul, Sura, not only in his features, but in the mode even<pb n="2148" />of opening his mouth, and the spasmodic contraction of histongue, and his hurried and indistinct utterance when speaking.Cassius Severus,<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> the celebrated orator, had it thrown in histeeth how strongly he resembled Armentarius, the gladiator.<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>Toranius, a slave-dealer, sold to Antony, while he was one ofthe Triumvirs, two boys of remarkable beauty, as being twins,so strong was their resemblance; whereas, in reality, one of themwas born in Asia, and the other beyond the Alps. The fraud,however, having been soon afterwards discovered through thedifference in the language of the youths, Antony, who wasgreatly exasperated, violently upbraided the dealer, and, amongother things, complained that he had fixed the price at so higha sum as two hundred thousand sesterces.<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> The crafty slave-merchant, however, made answer that that was the very reasonfor his having set so high a price upon them; for, as he said,there would have been nothing particularly striking in the resemblance of the boys, if they had been born of the same mother, whereas, children found to be so exactly like each other,though natives of different countries, ought to be deemedabove all price; an answer which produced such a reasonablefeeling of surprise and admiration in the mind of the proscriber,<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> that he who was but just before frantic under theinjury he had received, was led to set a higher value on nopart whatever of all the property in his possession.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">There has been much discussion respecting the meaning of this passage and the fact to which it refers. Aristotle, Hist. Anim., says, thatmarks made on the arm are transmitted for three generations; and Pliny,in B. xxii. c. 2, informs us, that the Daci and the Sarmat¾ "makewritten marks upon their bodies." The same custom prevails among thelower orders, sailors especially, in our own times. We may also remarkthe analogy which it bears to the practice of tattooing, so general amongthe Polynesian and other barbarous nations.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The reader may be amused by a perusal of the collection of wonderful cases of this kind, which has been made by Dalechamps; see Lemaire,vol. iii. p. 65, note 4.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aristotle, in his History of Animals, relates a similar, but not thesame, story; he says that it occurred in Sicily, though he afterwards speaksof it as having happened in Elis. It is conjectured by Ajasson, that theindividual might have been born in Sicily, and have exhibited himself inElis, as a wrestler. If we are really to believe that his complexion wasthat of an ®thiopian, it is much more probable that his mother may havehad connection with a negro.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Few readers will fail here to recall to mind the story about the clock,in the opening chapter of "Tristram Shandy."</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Dalechamps refers us to a remark of the same kind in Cicero, Tusc.Qu¾st. B. i. e. 80; but Ajasson remarks, that the resemblance mentionedby Cicero refers to the mind and manners, not to the body; Lemaire,vol. iii. p. 67.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Aulus Gellius says, that he was one of the royal family.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This man resembled Antiochus III., surnamed the Great, to such adegree, that when that monarch had been slain in a tumult by his people,his wife, Laodice, daughter of Mithridates V., King of Pontus, putArtemon into a bed, pretending that he was the king, but dangerously ill.Many persons were admitted to see him; and all believed that they werelistening to the words of their king, when he recommended to them Laodiceand her children.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This circumstance is related by Valerius Maximus, but he speaks ofVibius as being "ingenu¾ stirpis," "of good family."ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hardouin expands the words "os probum," into "liberale, venustum, gratum, venerandum, probandum," B. xxxvii. c. 6.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xxxvii. c. 6.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Latin word "strabo," means "squinting," or "having a cast" or"defect in the eye."</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The word "mimus" was applied by the Romans to a species of dramatic performance, as well as to the persons who acted in them. TheRoman mimes were imitations of trivial and sometimes indecent occurrences in life, and scarcely differed from comedy, except in consisting moreof gestures and mimicry than of spoken dialogue. Sylla was very fondof these performances, and they had more charms for the Roman populacethan the regular drama. As to the mime Salvitto, here mentioned, seeB. xxxv. c. 2.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This anecdote, and the one respecting Spinther and Pamphilus, arementioned also by Val.

He is mentioned in the Index of authors at the end of B. xxxvi.,where he is called Longulanus, as being a native of Longula, a town ofLatium.

Many of the editions make this word to be a propername, and "Armentarius" to signify the calling of the person described,as being a herdsman. The "Mirmillones" were a peculiar class of gladiators, said to have been so called from their having the image of a fish,called "mormyr," on their helmets.</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">We assume the sestertium to be equivalent to somewhat more thaneight pounds sterling; this sum will be about £<date value="1600" authname="1600">1600</date>.ÑB.</p><p><span id="note_17"><a href="#ref_17">17. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Proscripter animus."
