It is similar in nature to the palm, as its leavesare similarly used for the purposes of texture: it differs fromit, however, in spreading out its arms in large branches. Thefruit, which is of a size large enough to fill the hand, is of atawny colour, and recommends itself by its juice, which is amixture of sweet and rough. The seed in the inside is largeand of remarkable hardness, and turners use it for makingcurtain rings.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> The kernel is sweet, while fresh; but whendried it becomes hard to a most remarkable degree, so muchso, that it can only be eaten after being soaked in water forseveral days. The wood is beautifully mottled with circlingveins,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> for which reason it is particularly esteemed among thePersians.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Many have taken this to be the cocoa-nut tree; but, as Fée remarks,that is a tree of India, and this of Egypt. There is little doubt that it isthe <hi rend="ital">doum</hi> of the Arabs, the Cucifera Thebaica of Delille. The timber ofthe trunk is much used in Egypt, and of the leaves carpets, bags, andpanniers are made. In fact, the description of it and its fruit is almostidentical with that here given by Pliny.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The seed or stone of the doum is still used in Egypt for making thebeads of chaplets: it admits of a very high polish.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Materies crispioris elegantiæ.</p></body>
