Cæsar in Gaul. Such was theindividual, that nothing may be wanting to the indignityof the example, who first adopted this practice; the sameMamurra, in fact, who has been so torn to pieces in the versesof Catullus of Verona. Indeed, his own house proclaimedmore loudly than Catullus could proclaim it, that he had comeinto possession of all that Gallia Comata had had to possess.<pb n="6325" />For Nepos adds, as well, that he was the first to have all thecolumns of his house made of nothing but solid marble, andthat, too, marble of Carystus<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> or of Luna.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See end of B. ii.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Owing to the liberality of Cæsar, he amassed great riches. He isrepeatedly attacked by Catullus (Carm. xxix., xliii., lvii.), and accused ofextortion, and other vices. Horace also speaks of him in terms of ridicule,I Sat. 5, 37.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. iv. c. 21.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See Chapter 4 of this Book.</p></body>
