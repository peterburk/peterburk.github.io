<div2 type="chapter" n="51" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 51. (22.)—EXTREME FERTILITY OF SOIL.</head><p>There is a city of Africa, situate in the midst of the sandsas you journey towards the Syrtes and Great Leptis, Tacape<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>by name. The soil there, which is always well-watered, enjoys a degree of fertility quite marvellous. Through thisspot, which extends about three miles each way, a spring ofwater flows—in great abundance it is true—but still, it is onlyat certain hours that its waters are distributed among theinhabitants. Here, beneath a palm of enormous size, grows theolive, beneath the olive the fig, beneath the fig, again, thepomegranate, beneath the pomegranate the vine, and beneath thevine we find sown, first wheat, then the leguminous plants, andafter them garden herbs—all in the same year, and all growingbeneath another's shade. Four cubits square of this sameground—the cubit<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> being measured with the fingers contractedand not extended—sell at the rate of four denarii.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> But whatis more surprising than all, is the fact that here the vine bearstwice, and that there are two vintages in the year. Indeed,if the fertility of the soil were not distributed in this wayamong a multitude of productions, each crop would perish fromits own exuberance: as it is, there is no part of the year thatthere is not some crop or other being gathered in; and yet, itis a well-known fact, that the people do nothing at all to promotethis fruitfulness.<pb n="4068" /></p><p>There are very considerable differences, too, in the nature ofwater, as employed for the purposes of irrigation. In theprovince of Gallia Narbonensis there is a famous fountain,Orge by name; within it there grow plants which are soughtfor with such eagerness by the cattle, that they will plungeover head into the water to get at them; it is a well ascertained<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>fact, however, that these plants, though growing in the water,receive their nutriment only from the rains that fall. It isas well then that every one should be fully acquainted with thenature, not only of the soil, but of the water too.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. v. c. 3, and B. xvi. c. 50.
