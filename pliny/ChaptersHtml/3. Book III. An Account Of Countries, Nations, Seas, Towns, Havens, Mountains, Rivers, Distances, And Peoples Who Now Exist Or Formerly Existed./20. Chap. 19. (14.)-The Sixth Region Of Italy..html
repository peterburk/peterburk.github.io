<div2 type="chapter" n="19" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 19. (14.)ÑTHE SIXTH REGION OF ITALY.</head><p>Adjoining to this is the sixth region, which includes Umbria and the Gallic territory in the vicinity of Ariminum.At Ancona begins the coast of that part of Gaul known asGallia Togata<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>. The Siculi and the Liburni possessed thegreater part of this district, and more particularly the territories of Palma, of Pr¾tutia, and of Adria. These wereexpelled by the Umbri, these again by the Etrurians, andthese in their turn by the Gauls. The Umbri are thoughtto have been the most ancient race in Italy, it being supposed that they were called "Ombrii" by the Greeks, from thefact of their having survived the rains<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> which had inundated<pb n="1238" />the earth. We read that 300 of their towns were conqueredby the Tusci; at the present day we find on their coast theriver ®sis<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>, Senogallia<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, the river Metaurus, the colonies ofFanum Fortun¾<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> and Pisaurum<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>, with a river of the samename; and, in the interior, those of Hispellum<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> and Tuder.</p><p>Besides the above, there are the Amerini<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>, the Attidiates<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>,the Asisinates<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>, the Arnates<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>, the ®sinates<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>, the Camertes<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>,the Casuentillani, the Carsulani<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>, the Dolates surnamed<pb n="1239" />Salentini, the Fulginiates<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>, the Foroflaminienses<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span>, the Forojulienses surnamed Concupienses, the Forobrentani, the Forosempronienses<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span>, the Iguvini<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span>, the Interamnates surnamedNartes, the Mevanates<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span>, the Mevanionenses, the Matilicates<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span>,the Narnienses<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span>, whose town used formerly to be calledNequinum; the Nucerini<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span>, both those surnamed Favoniensesand those called Camellani; the Ocriculani<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span>, the Ostrani<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span>,the Pitulani, both those surnamed Pisuertes and the otherscalled Mergentini; the Plestini<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span>, the Sentinates<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span>, the Sarsi-<pb n="1240" />nates<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span>, the Spoletini<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span>, the Suasini<span id="ref_29"><a href="#note_29">[29]</a></span>, the Sestinates<span id="ref_30"><a href="#note_30">[30]</a></span>, theSuillates<span id="ref_31"><a href="#note_31">[31]</a></span>, the Tadinates<span id="ref_32"><a href="#note_32">[32]</a></span>, the Trebiates<span id="ref_33"><a href="#note_33">[33]</a></span>, the Tuficani<span id="ref_34"><a href="#note_34">[34]</a></span>, theTifernates<span id="ref_35"><a href="#note_35">[35]</a></span> surnamed Tiberini, and the others called Metaurenses, the Vesinicates, the Urbinates, both those surnamedMetaurenses<span id="ref_36"><a href="#note_36">[36]</a></span> and the others called Hortenses, the Vettonenses<span id="ref_37"><a href="#note_37">[37]</a></span>, the Vindinates, and the Viventani. In this districtthere exist no longer the Feliginates who possessed Clusiolum above Interamna, and the Sarranates, with theirtowns of Acerr¾<span id="ref_38"><a href="#note_38">[38]</a></span>, surnamed Vafri¾, and Turocelum, alsocalled Vettiolum; as also the Solinates, the Curiates, theFallienates, and the Apiennates. The Arienates also havedisappeared with the town of Crinovolum, as well as theUsidicani, the Plangenses, the P¾sinates, and the C¾lestini.<pb n="1241" />Cato writes that Ameria above-mentioned was founded 964years before the war with Perseus.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cisalpine Gaul was so called because the inhabitants adopted the use of the Roman toga.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This fanciful derivation would make their name to come from the Greek <foreign lang="greek">o)/mbros</foreign> "a shower."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now the Esino.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">So called from the Galli Senones. The modern city of Sinigaglia occupies its site. The river Metaurus is still called the Metauro.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The Temple of Fortune." At this spot the Flaminian Way joined the road from Ancona and Picenum to Ariminum. The modern city of Fano occupies the site, but there are few remains of antiquity.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The modern Pesaro occupies the site of the town; the river is called the Foglia.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This was a flourishing town of Umbria. Augustus showed it especial favour and bestowed on it the Grove and Temple of Clitumnus, though at twelve miles' distance from the town. The modern town of Spello occupies its site, and very extensive remains of antiquity are still to be seen. It probably received two Roman colonies, as inscriptions mention the "Colonia Julia Hispelli" and the "Colonia Urbana Flavia." It is considered probable that Hispellum, rather than Mevania, was the birth-place of the poet Propertius. Tuder is supposed to have occupied the site of the modern Todi, on the Tiber.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The people of Ameria, an important and flourishing city of Umbria. There are still remains of the ancient walls; the modern town of Amelia occupies its site.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The site of Attidium is marked by the modern village of Attigio, two miles south of the city of Fabriano, to which the inhabitants of Attidium are supposed to have migrated in the middle ages.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The people of Asisium. The modern city of Assisi (the birth-place of St. Francis) occupies its site. There are considerable remains of the ancient town.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The people of Arna, the site of which is now occupied by the town of Civitella d'Arno, five miles east of Perugia. Some inscriptions and other objects of antiquity have been found here.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The people of ®sis, situate on the river of the same name. It is still called Iesi. Pliny, in B. xi. c. 97, mentions it as famous for the excellence of its cheeses.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The people of Camerinum, a city of Umbria. The present Camerino occupies its site. Its people were among the most considerable of Umbria. The site of the Casuentillani does not appear to be known.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The people of Carsul¾, an Umbrian town of some importance. Its ruins are still visible about half way between San Germino and Acqua Sparta, ten miles north of Narni. Holsten states that the site was still called Carsoli in his time, and there existed remains of an amphitheatre and a triumphal arch in honour of Trajan. Nothing seems to be known of the Dolates.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The people of Fulginium. From Cicero we learn that it was a municipal town. The modern city of Foligno has risen on its site. An inscription discovered here has preserved the name of Fulginia, probably a local divinity.</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The people of Forum Flaminii, situated on the Flaminian Way, where it first entered the Apennines, three miles from Fulginium. It was here that the Emperors Gallus and Volusianus were defeated and slain by ®milianus, A.D. <date value="256" authname="256">256</date>. The ruins at the spot called Giovanni pro Fiamma mark its site. The site of Forum Julii appears to be unknown, as also that of Forum Brentani.</p><p><span id="note_17"><a href="#ref_17">17. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The people of Forum Sempronii, the only town in the valley of the Metaurus. The modern city of Fossombrone, two miles distant, has thence taken its name. Considerable vestiges of the ancient town are still to be seen. The battle in which Hasdrubal was defeated by the Roman consuls Livius and Nero, B.C. <date value="-207" authname="-207">207</date>, was probably fought in its vicinity.</p><p><span id="note_18"><a href="#ref_18">18. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The people of Iguvium, an ancient and important town of Umbria.

The Mevanionenses were the people of Mevanio, or Mevaniol¾, in the vicinity of Mevania, and thought by Cluver to be the modern Galeata.</p><p><span id="note_20"><a href="#ref_20">20. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Their town was Matilica, which still retains that name. It is situate in the Marches of Ancona.</p><p><span id="note_21"><a href="#ref_21">21. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Their town still retains the name of Narni.</p><p><span id="note_22"><a href="#ref_22">22. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Their town was surnamed Favonia and Camellaria, to distinguish it from several others of the same name.
