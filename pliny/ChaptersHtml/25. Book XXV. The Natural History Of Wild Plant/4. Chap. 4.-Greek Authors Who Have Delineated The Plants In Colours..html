Among them, Crateuas,Dionysius, and Metrodorus, adopted a very attractive methodof description, though one which has done little more thanprove the remarkable difficulties which attended it. It wastheir plan to delineate the various plants in colours, and thento add in writing a description of the properties which theypossessed. Pictures, however, are very apt to mislead, andmore particularly where such a number of tints is required,for the imitation of nature with any success; in addition towhich, the diversity of copyists from the original paintings,and their comparative degrees of skill, add very considerablyto the chances of losing the necessary degree of resemblanceto the originals. And then, besides, it is not sufficient to delineate a plant as it appears at one period only, as it presentsa different appearance at each of the four seasons of the year.<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The four great changes in plants, though not always at the fourseasons of the year, are the budding and foliation, the blossoming, thefructification, and the fall of the leaf.</p></body>
