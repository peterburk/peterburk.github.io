<div2 type="chapter" n="39" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 39.—DIVISION OF THE EARTH INTO PARALLELS AND SHADOWS OF EQUAL LENGTH.</head><p>To the above we shall add even another instance of ingeniousdiscovery by the Greeks, and indeed of the most minute skilfulness; that so nothing may be wanting to our investigation ofthe geographical divisions of the earth, and the various countriesthereof which have been pointed out; that it may be thebetter understood, too, what affinity, or relationship as it were,exists between one region and another, in respect to the lengthof their days and nights, and in which of them the shadowsare of equal length, and the distance from the pole is the same.I shall therefore give these particulars as well, and shallstate the divisions of the whole earth in accordance with thevarious sections of the heavens. The lines or segments which<pb n="2111" />divide the world are many in number; by our people theyare known as "circuli" or circles, by the Greeks they arecalled "paralleli" or parallels.</p><p>(34.) The first begins at that part of India which looks towards the south, and extends to Arabia and those who dwellupon the borders of the Red Sea. It embraces the Gedrosi,the Carmanii, the Persæ, the Elymæi, Parthyene, Aria, Susiane, Mesopotamia, Seleucia surnamed Babylonia, Arabia as faras Petra, Cœle Syria, Pelusium, the lower parts of Egypt calledthe Chora of Alexandria, the maritime parts of Africa, all thecities of Cyrenaica, Thapsus, Adrumetum, Clupea, Carthage,Utica, the two Hippo's, Numidia, the two Mauritanias, theAtlantic Sea, and the Pillars of Hercules. Within the meridian of this parallel, on the middle day of the equinox, thepin of the dial, usually called the gnomon, if seven feet inlength, throws a shadow at mid-day no more than four feet long:the longest day and night are fourteen equinoctial hoursrespectively, the shortest being only ten.</p><p>The next circle or parallel begins with the western parts ofIndia, and runs through the middle of Parthia, through Persepolis, the nearer parts of Persis, the nearer Arabia, Judæa, andthe people who live near Mount Libanus, and it embraces Babylon, Idumæa, Samaria, Hierosolyma, Ascalon, Joppa, Cæsareain Phoenicia, Ptolemais, Sidon, Tyre, Berytus, Botrys, Tripolis,Byblus, Antiochia, Laodicea, Seleucia, the maritime parts ofCilicia, the southern parts of Cyprus, Crete, Lilybæum inSicily, and the northern parts of Africa and Numidia. In theseregions, at the time of the equinox, a gnomon of thirty-fivefeet in length gives only a shadow twenty-four feet long; andthe longest day and night are respectively fourteen equinoctialhours, and one-fifth of an hour, in length.</p><p>The third circle or parallel begins at the part of Indiawhich lies in the vicinity of Mount Imaiis, and runs throughthe Caspian Gates and the nearer parts of Media, Cataonia,(appadocia, Taurus, Amanus, Issus, the Passes of Cilicia,Soli, Tarsus, Cyprus, Pisidia, Side in Pamphylia, Lycaonia,Patara in Lycia, Xanthus, Caunus, Rhodes, Cos, Halicarnassus, Cnidos, Doris, Chios, Delos, the middle of the Cyclades,Gythium, Malea, Argos, Laconia, Elis, Olympia, Messenia inPeloponnesus, Syracuse, Catina, the middle of Sicily, thesouthern parts of Sardinia, Carteia, and Gades. A gnomon,<pb n="2112" />one hundred inches in length, throws a shadow seventy-seven inches long; the length of the longest day is fourteenequinoctial hours and a half, plus one thirtieth of an hour.</p><p>Under the fourth circle or parallel lie those parts of Indiawhich are on the other side of the Imaiis, the southern partsof Cappadocia, Galatia, Mysia, Sardis, Smyrna, Sipylus,Mount Tmolus, Lydia, Caria, Ionia, Tralles, Colophon,Ephesus, Miletus, Chios, Samos, the Icarian Sea, the northernpart of the Cyclades, Athens, Megara, Corinth, Sicyon, Achaia,Patræ, the Isthmus, Epirus, the northern parts of Sicily, theeastern parts of Gallia Narbonensis, and the sea-coast of Spain,from New Carthage westward. In these districts a gnomonof twenty-one feet throws a shadow of sixteen feet in length;the longest day contains fourteen equinoctial hours and two-thirds of an hour.</p><p>Under the fifth zone are included, from the entrance to theCaspian Sea, the Bactri, Iberia, Armenia, Mysia, Phrygia, theHellespont, Troas, Tenedos, Abydos, Scepsis, Ilium, MountIda, Cyzicus, Lampsacus, Sinope, Amisus, Heraclea in Pontus,Paphlagonia, Lemnos, Imbros, Thasos, Cassandria, Thessaly,Macedonia, Larissa, Amphipolis, Thessalonica, Pella, Edessa,Berœa, Pharsalia, Carystus, Eubœa in Bœotia, Chalcis, Delphi,Acarnania, Ætolia, Apollonia, Brudisium, Tarentum, Thurii,Locri, Rhegium, the Lucani, Neapolis, Puteoli, the Tuscan Sea,Corsica, the Balearic Islands, and the middle of Spain. Agnomon, seven feet in length, in these countries gives a shadowof six feet, and the length of the day is fifteen equinoctial hours.</p><p>The sixth division, in which Rome is included, embracesthe Caspian nations, Caucasus, the northern parts of Armenia, Apollonia on the Rhyndacus, Nicomedia, Nicæa,Chalcedon, Byzantium, Lysimachia, the Chersonnesus, theGulf of Melas, Abdera, Samothracia, Maronea, Ænus, Bessica,Thracia, Mædica, Pæonia, the Illyrii, Dyrrhachium, Canusium, the extreme parts of Apulia, Campania, Etruria, Pisæ,Luna, Luca, Genua, Liguria, Antipolis, Massilia, Narbo,Tarraco, the middle parts of Hispania Tarraconensis, andthence through Lusitania. A gnomon of nine feet herethrows a shadow eight feet long; the greatest length of theday is fifteen equinoctial hours, plus one-ninth part of an hour,or, according to Nigidius, one-fifth.</p><p>The seventh division begins on the other side of the Caspian<pb n="2113" />Sea, and the line runs above Callatis, and through the Bosporus, the Borysthenes, Tomi, the back part of Thrace, theTriballi, the remainder of Illyricum, the Adriatic Sea, Aquileia,Altinum, Venetia, Vicetia, Patavium, Verona, Cremona, Ravenna, Ancona, Picenum, the Marsi, the Peligni, the Sabini,Umbria, Ariminum, Bononia, Placentia, Mediolanum, all thedistricts at the foot of the Apennines, and, beyond the Alps,Gallia Aquitanica, Vienna, the Pyrenæan range, and Celtiberia. A gnomon thirty-five feet in length here throws ashadow of thirty-six feet, except in some parts of Venetia,where the shadow just equals the length of the gnomon; thelongest day is fifteen equinoctial hours, plus three-fifths of anhour.</p><p>Thus far we have set forth the results of observations madeby the ancients. The remaining part of the earth has beendivided, through the careful researches of those of more recenttimes, by three additional parallels. The first runs from theTanais through the Mæotis and the country of the Sarmatæ,as far as the Borysthenes, and so through the Daci and part ofGermany, and the Gallic provinces, as far as the shores of theocean, the longest day being sixteen hours.</p><p>The second parallel runs through the country of the Hyperborei and the island of Britannia, the longest day beingseventeen hours in length.</p><p>The last of all is the Scythian parallel, which runs from theRiphæan range to Thule, in which, as we have already stated,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>the year is divided into days and nights alternately, of sixmonths' duration. The same authors have also placed beforethe first parallel, which we have here given,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> two other parallelsor circles; the first running through the island of Meroë andthe city of Ptolemais which was built on the Red Sea forthe chase of the elephant; where the longest day is twelvehours and a half in length; and the second passing throughSyene in Egypt, in which the longest day is thirteen hours inlength. The same authors have also added half an hour toeach of the parallels, till they come to the last.</p><p>Thus far on the Geography of the earth.</p><p>SUMMARY.—Towns mentioned, eleven hundred and ninety-four.
