<div2 type="chapter" n="38" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 38.—REMEDIES FOR DISEASES OF THE EYES.</head><p>According to what the magicians say, glaucoma<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> may becured by using the brains of a puppy seven days old; the probebeing inserted in the right side [of the eye], if it is the righteye that is being operated on, and in the left side, if it is theleft. The fresh gall, too, of the asio<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> is used, a bird belongingto the owlet tribe, with feathers standing erect like ears.Apollonius of Pitanæ used to prefer dog's gall, in combination with honey, to that of the hyæna, for the cure of cataract,as also of albugo. The heads and tails of mice, reduced toashes and applied to the eyes, improve the sight, it is said; aresult which is ensured with even greater certainty by using theashes of a dormouse or wild mouse, or else the brains or gallof an eagle. The ashes and fat of a field-mouse, beaten upwith Attic honey and antimony, are remarkably useful forwatery eyes—what this antimony<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> is, we shall have occasionto say when speaking of metals.</p><p>For the cure of cataract, the ashes of a weasel are used, asalso the brains of a lizard or swallow. Weasels, boiled andpounded, and so applied to the forehead, allay defluxions of theeyes, either used alone, or else with fine flour or with frankincense. Employed in a similar manner, they are very good forsun-stroke, or in other words, for injuries inflicted by the sun.It is a remarkably good plan, too, to burn these animals alive,and to use their ashes, with Cretan honey, as a liniment for<pb n="5412" />films upon the eyes. The cast-off<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> slough of the asp, withthe fat of that reptile, forms an excellent ointment for improving the sight in beasts of burden. To burn a viper alivein a new earthen vessel, with one cyathus of fennel juice,and a single grain of frankincense, and then to anoint the eyeswith the mixture, is remarkably good for cataract and filmsupon the eyes; the preparation being generally known as"echeon."<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> An eye-salve, too, is prepared, by leaving aviper to putrefy in an earthen pot, and bruising the maggotsthat breed in it with saffron. A viper, too, is burnt in avessel with salt, and the preparation is applied to the tip ofthe tongue, to improve the eyesight, and to act generally as acorrective of the stomach and other parts of the body. Thissalt is given also to sheep, to preserve them in health, and isused as an ingredient in antidotes to the venom of serpents.</p><p>Some persons, again, use vipers as an article of food: whenthis is done, it is recommended, the moment they are killed,to put some salt in the mouth and let it melt there; afterwhich, the body must be cut away to the length of four fingersat each extremity, and, the intestines being first removed, theremainder boiled in a mixture of water, oil, salt, and dill.When thus prepared, they are either eaten at once, or elsekneaded in a loaf, and taken from time to time as wanted.In addition to the above-mentioned properties, viper-brothcleanses all parts of the body of lice,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> and removes itchingsensations as well upon the surface of the skin. The ashes,also, of a viper's head, used by themselves, are evidently productive of considerable effects; they are employed very advantageously in the form of a liniment for the eyes; and so, too, isviper's fat. I would not make so bold as to advise what isstrongly recommended by some, the use, namely, of vipers'gall; for that, as already stated<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> on a more appropriate occasion, is nothing else but the venom of the serpent. The fat ofsnakes, mixed with verdigrease,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> heals ruptures of the cuticleof the eyes; and the skin or slough that is cast off in spring,employed as a friction for the eyes, improves the sight. The<pb n="5413" />gall of the boa<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> is highly vaunted for the cure of albugo, cataract, and films upon the eyes, and the fat is thought to improvethe sight.</p><p>The gall of the eagle, which tests its young, as alreadystated,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> by making them look upon the sun, forms, with Attichoney, an eye-salve which is very good for the cure of webs,films, and cataracts of the eye. A vulture's gall, too, mixedwith leek-juice and a little honey, is possessed of similar properties; and the gall of a cock, dissolved in water, is employedfor the cure of argema and albugo: the gall, too, of a whitecock, in particular, is recommended for cataract. For shortsighted persons, the dung of poultry is recommended as a liniment, care being taken to use that of a reddish colour only.A hen's gall, too, is highly spoken of, and the fat in particular,for the cure of pustules upon the pupils, a purpose for whichhens are expressly fattened. This last substance is marvellously useful for ruptures of the coats of the eyes, incorporatedwith the stones known as schistos<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> and hæmatites. Hens'dung, too, but only the white part of it, is kept with old oilin boxes made of horn, for the cure of white specks upon thepupil of the eye. While mentioning this subject, it is worthyof remark, that peacocks<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> swallow their dung, it is said, asthough they envied man the various uses of it. A hawk,boiled in oil of roses, is considered extremely efficacious as a liniment for all affections of the eyes, and so are the ashes of itsdung, mixed with Attic honey. A kite's liver, too, is highlyesteemed; and pigeons' dung, diluted with vinegar, is used asan application for fistulas of the eye, as also for albugo andmarks upon that organ. Goose gall and duck's blood are veryuseful for contusions of the eyes, care being taken, immediatelyafter the application, to anoint them with a mixture of woolgrease and honey. In similar cases, too, gall of partridges isused, with an equal quantity of honey; but where it is onlywanted to improve the sight, the gall is used alone. It isgenerally thought, too, upon the authority of Hippocrates,<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span><pb n="5414" />that the gall to be used for these purposes should be kept in asilver box.</p><p>Partridges' eggs, boiled in a copper vessel, with honey, arecurative of ulcers of the eyes, and of glaucoma. For thetreatment of blood-shot eyes, the blood of pigeons, ring-doves,turtle-doves, and partridges is remarkably useful; but thatof the male pigeon is generally looked upon as the most efficacious. For this purpose, a vein is opened beneath the wing,it being warmer than the rest of the blood, and consequentlymore<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> beneficial. After it is applied, a compress, boiled inhoney, should be laid upon it, and some greasy wool, boiled inoil and wine. Nyctalopy,<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> too, is cured by using the blood ofthese birds, or the liver of a sheep—the most efficaciousbeing that of a tawny sheep—as already<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> stated by uswhen speaking of goats. A decoction, too, of the liver isrecommended as a wash for the eyes, and, for pains and swellings in those organs, the marrow, used as a liniment. The eyesof a horned owl, it is strongly asserted, reduced to ashes andmixed in an eye-salve, will improve the sight. Albugo is madeto disappear by using the dung of turtle-doves, snails burnt toashes, and the dung of the cenchris, a kind of hawk, accordingto the Greeks.<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> All the substances above mentioned, used incombination with honey, are curative of argema: honey, too,in which the bees have died, is remarkably good for the eyes.</p><p>A person who has eaten the young of the stork will neversuffer from ophthalmia for many years to come, it is said; andthe same when a person carries about him the head of adragon:<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> it is stated, too, that the fat of this last-namedanimal, applied with honey and old oil, will disperse incipientfilms of the eyes. The young of the swallow are blinded atfull moon, and the moment their sight is restored,<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> their headsare burnt, and the ashes are employed, with honey, to improvethe sight, and for the cure of pains, ophthalmia, and contusions of the eyes.</p><p>Lizards, also, are employed in numerous ways as a remedy<pb n="5415" />for diseases of the eyes. Some persons enclose a green lizardin a new earthen vessel, together with nine of the small stonesknown as "cinædia,"<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> which are usually attached to the bodyfor tumours in the groin. Upon each of these stones theymake nine<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> marks, and remove one from the vessel daily,taking care, when the ninth day is come, to let the lizard go,the stones being kept as a remedy for affections of the eyes.Others, again, blind a green lizard, and after putting someearth beneath it, enclose it in a glass vessel, with some smallrings of solid iron or gold. When they find, by lookingthrough the glass, that the lizard has recovered its sight,<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> theyset it at liberty, and keep the rings as a preservative againstophthalmia. Others employ the ashes of a lizard's head asa substitute for antimony, for the treatment of eruptions of theeyes. Some recommend the ashes of the green lizard with a longneck that is usually found in sandy soils, as an application forincipient defluxions of the eyes, and for glaucoma. They say,too, that if the eyes of a weasel are extracted with a pointedinstrument, its sight will return; the same use being made of itas of the lizards and rings above mentioned. The right eyeof a serpent, worn as an amulet, is very good, it is said, fordefluxions of the eyes, due care being taken to set the serpentat liberty after extracting the eye. For continuous watering<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span>of the eyes, the ashes of a spotted lizard's head, applied withantimony, are remarkably efficacious.</p><p>The cobweb of the common fly-spider, that which lines itshole more particularly, applied to the forehead across thetemples, in a compress of some kind or other, is said to bemarvellously useful for the cure of defluxions of the eyes: theweb must be taken, however, and applied by the hands of aboy who has not arrived at the years of puberty; the boy,too, must not show himself to the patient for three days, andduring those three days neither of them must touch theground with his feet uncovered. The white spider<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span> with<pb n="5416" />very elongated, thin, legs, beaten up in old oil, forms an ointment which is used for the cure of albugo. The spider, too,whose web, of remarkable thickness, is generally found adhering to the rafters of houses, applied in a piece of cloth, issaid to be curative of defluxions of the eyes. The greenscarabæus has the property of rendering the sight morepiercing<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span> of those who gaze upon it: hence it is that theengravers of precious stones use these insects to steady theirsight.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A disease of the crystalline humours of the eye.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. x. c. :33.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Stibium."
