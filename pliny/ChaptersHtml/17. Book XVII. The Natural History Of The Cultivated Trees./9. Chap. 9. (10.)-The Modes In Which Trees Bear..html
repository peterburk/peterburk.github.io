(10.)—THE MODES IN WHICH TREES BEAR.</head><p>Having now treated at sufficient length of the requisite conditions of the weather and the soil, we shall proceed to speakof those trees which are the result of the care and inventiveskill of man. Indeed, the varieties of them are hardly lessnumerous than of those which are produced by Nature,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> soabundantly have we testified our gratitude in return for hernumerous bounties. For these trees, we find, are reared eitherfrom seed, or else by transplanting, by layers, by slips torn fromthe stock, by cuttings, by grafting, or by cutting into the trunkof the tree. But as to the story that the leaves of the palmare planted by the Babylonians, and so give birth<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> to a tree,I am really surprised that Trogus should have ever believedit. Some of the trees are reproduced by several of the methods above enumerated, others, again, by all of them.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xvi. c. 58.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The palm is grown in Africa from shoots thrown out from the axillæof the leaves; and it is in this circumstance, Fée thinks, that the story toldby Trogus must have originated. Some of the ferns throw out adventitiousbuds from the summit of the leaf, and the orange tree and some othersoccasionally have them at the base of the leaf.</p></body>
