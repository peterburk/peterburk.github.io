<div2 type="chapter" n="34" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 34.—OTHER PLANTS THAT ARE CUT FOR POLES ANDSTAKES.</head><p>The chesnut is found to produce better stays<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> for the vinethan any other tree, both from the facility with which theyare worked, their extremely lasting qualities, and the circumstance that, when cut, the tree will bud again more speedilythan the willow<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> even. It requires a soil that is light withoutbeing gravelly, a moist, sandy one more particularly, or else acharcoal earth,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> or a fine tufa<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> even; while at the same timea northern aspect, however cold and shady, and if upon adeclivity even, greatly promotes its growth. It refuses togrow, however, in a gravelly soil, or in red earth, chalk, or,indeed, any kind of fertilizing ground. We have alreadystated,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> that it is reproduced from the nut, but it willonly grow from those of the largest size, and then only whenthey are sown in heaps of five together. The ground abovethe nuts should be kept broken from the month of Novemberto February, as it is at that period that the nuts lose theirhold and fall of themselves from the tree, and then takeroot. There ought to be intervals of a foot in width leftbetween them,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> and the hole in which they are planted shouldbe nine inches every way. At the end of two years or morethey are transplanted from this seed plot into another, wherethey are laid out at intervals of a couple of feet.</p><p>Layers are also employed for the reproduction of this tree,and there is none to which they are better<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> adapted: the rootof the plant is left exposed, and the layer is placed in thetrench at full length, with the summit also protruding fromthe earth; the result being, that it shoots from the top as well<pb n="3495" />as the root. When transplanted, however, it is very hard to bereconciled, as it stands in dread of all change. Hence it is,that it is nearly two years before it will begin to shoot upward;from which circumstance it is generally preferred to rear theslips in the nursery from the nut itself, to obtaining them fromquicksets. The mode of cultivation does not differ from thatemployed with the plants already mentioned.<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> It is trenchedaround, and carefully lopped for two successive years; afterwhich it is able to take care of itself, the shade it gives sufficingto stifle all superfluous suckers: before the end of the sixthyear it is fit for cutting.</p><p>A single jugerum of chesnuts will provide stays for twentyjugera of vineyard, and the branches that are taken from nearthe roots afford a supply of two-forked uprights; they will last,too, till after the next cutting of the tree.</p><p>The æsculus,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> too, is grown in a similar manner, the timefor cutting being three years at the latest. Being less difficult, too, to propagate, it may be planted in any kind of earth,the acorn—and it is only with the æsculus that this is done—being sown in spring, in a hole nine inches in depth, with intervals between the plants of two feet in width. This tree islightly hoed, four times a year. This kind of stay is the leastlikely to rot of them all; and the more the tree is cut, themore abundantly it shoots. In addition to the above, theyalso grow other trees for cutting that we have already mentioned—the ash for instance, the laurel, the peach, the hazel,and the apple; but then they are of slower growth, and thestays made from them, when fixed in the ground, are hardlyable to withstand the action of the earth, and much less anymoisture. The elder, on the other hand, which affords stakesof the very stoutest quality, is grown from cuttings, like thepoplar. As to the cypress, we have already spoken of it atsufficient length.<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Pedamenta," uprights, stays, stakes, or props.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is not the fact, for the chesnut both grows and buds very slowly.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A black, hot kind of earth.

Pliny borrows this erroneous assertion fromColumella, I. iv. c. 32. In mentioning the heaps of five nuts, Pliny seemsto have had some superstitious observance in view, for Columella only saysthat they must be sown thickly, to prevent accident. The same is done atthe present day, in order to making provision for the depredations of field-mice, rats, and mice, which are particularly fond of them.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The willow and the reed.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xvi. cc. 5. 6, and 56.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In B. xvi. c. 60.</p></body>
