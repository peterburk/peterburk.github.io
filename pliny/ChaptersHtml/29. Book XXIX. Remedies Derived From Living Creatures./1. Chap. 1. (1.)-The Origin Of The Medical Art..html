(1.)ÑTHE ORIGIN OF THE MEDICAL ART.</head><p>THE nature and multiplicity of the various remedies alreadydescribed or which still remain to be enlarged upon, compelme to enter upon some further details with reference to theart of medicine itself: aware as I am, that no one<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> has hithertotreated of this subject in the Latin tongue, and that if all newenterprises are difficult or of doubtful success, it must be one inparticular which is so barren of all charms to recommend it,and accompanied with such difficulties of illustration. It willnot improbably suggest itself, however, to those who are familiar with this subject, to make enquiry how it is that in thepractice of medicine the use of simples has been abandoned,so convenient as they are and so ready prepared to our hand:and they will be inclined to feel equal surprise and indignationwhen they are informed that no known art, lucrative as this isbeyond all the rest, has been more fluctuating, or subjected tomore frequent variations.</p><p>Commencing by ranking its inventors in the number of thegods,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> and consecrating for them a place in heaven, the art of medicine, at the present day even, teaches us in numerous instancesto have recourse to the oracles for aid. In more recent timesagain, the same art has augmented its celebrity, at the cost perhapsof being charged with criminality, by devising the fable that®sculapius was struck by lightning for presuming to raise Tyndareus<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> to life. And this example notwithstanding, it has nothesitated to relate how that others, through its agency, havesince been restored to life. Already enjoying celebrity in the days<pb n="5371" />of the Trojan War, its traditions from that period have ac-quired an additional degree of certainty; although in thosetimes, we may remark, the healing art confined itself solely tothe treatment of wounds.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He must surely have forgotton Celsus; unless, indeed, Pliny was unacquainted with his treatise "De Medicin‰."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Apollo and ®sculapius, Agenor, Hercules, Chiron, and others.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The husband of Leda, and the father of Castor, Timandra, Clyt¾mnestra, and Philono‘.
