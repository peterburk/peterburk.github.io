Pearls are not always found in themiddle of the body of the animal, but sometimes in one place,<pb n="2437" />and sometimes another. Indeed, I have seen some which layat the edge of the shell, just as though in the very act ofcoming forth, and in some fishes as many as four or five.Up to the present time, very few have been found which exceeded half an ounce in weight, by more than one scruple. Itis a well-ascertained fact, that in Britannia<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> pearls are found,though small, and of a bad colour; for the deified Julius Cæsar<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>wished it to be distinctly understood,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> that the breast-platewhich he dedicated to Venus Genetrix, in her temple, wasmade of British pearls.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cuvier observes, that most of the rivers and lakes of the north ofEurope possess the mya margarifera: the pearls of which, though muchinferior to those of the East, are sufficiently esteemed to be made an articleof commerce. Pad pearls, of a dead marble colour, are also very frequentlyfound in the mussels taken off our coasts. Pearls have in modern timesdeclined very considerably in value; those of about the size of a large peacan be purchased, of very fine quality, for about a guinea each, while thoseof the size of a pepper-corn sell at about eighteen-pence. Seed pearls, ofthe size of small shot, are of very little value. Tavernier speaks of a remarkable pearl, that was found at Catifia, in Arabia, the fishery probablyalluded to by Pliny, in C. 54, and which he bought for the sum of £110,000,some accounts say £10,000, of our money. It is pear-shaped, the elenchusof the ancients, regular, and without blemish. The diameter is .63 of aninch, at the largest part, and the length from two to three inches. It issaid to be in the possession of the Shah of Persia.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Tacitus, in his Agricola, says that pearls of a tawny and livid colourare thrown up on the shores of Britain, and there collected. Suetoniusabsolutely says, c. 4, that Julius Cæsar invaded Britain in the hope ofobtaining pearls, in the weight and size of which he took considerableinterest.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">By the inscription placed beneath the thorax, or breast-plate.</p></body>
