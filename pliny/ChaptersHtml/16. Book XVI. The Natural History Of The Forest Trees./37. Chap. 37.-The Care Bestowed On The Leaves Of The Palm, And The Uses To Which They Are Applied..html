Among ourselves, too, the leaves of thepalm are generally plucked immediately after harvest, the bestbeing those that have no divisions in them. These leaves areleft to dry under cover for four days, after which they arespread out in the sun, and left out in the open air all night,till they have become quite white and dry: after this theyare split before they are put to any use.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">B. xiii. c. 7.</p></body>
