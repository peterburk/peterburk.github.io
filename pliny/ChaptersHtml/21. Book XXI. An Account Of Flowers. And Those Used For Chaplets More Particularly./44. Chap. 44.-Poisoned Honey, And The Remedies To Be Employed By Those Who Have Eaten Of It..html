At Heraclia<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> in Pontus, the honey is extremely pernicious in certain years, though it is the same bees that makeit at other times. Authors, however, have not informed usfrom what flowers this honey is extracted; we shall, therefore,take this opportunity of stating what we have ascertainedupon the subject.</p><p>There is a certain plant which, from the circumstance thatit proves fatal to beasts of burden, and to goats in particular,has obtained the name of "ægolcthron,"<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and the blossoms of<pb n="4342" />which, steeped in the rains of a wet spring, contract mostnoxious properties, Hence it is that it is not every year thatthese dangerous results are experienced. The following arethe signs of the honey being<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> poisonous: it never thickens,the colour is redder than usual, and it emits a peculiar smellwhich immediately produces sneezing; while, at the sametime, it is more weighty than a similar quantity of goodhoney. Persons, when they have eaten of it, throw themselves on the ground to cool the body, which is bathed with aprofuse perspiration. There are numerous remedies, of whichwe shall have occasion to speak in a more appropriate place;<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>but as it will be as well to mention some of them on the present occasion, by way of being provided for such insidious accidents, I will here state that old honied wine is good, mixedwith the finest honey and rue; salt meats, also, taken repeatedly in small quantities, and as often brought up again.</p><p>It is a well-known fact that dogs, after tasting the excretions of persons suffering from these attacks, have been attacked with similar symptoms, and have experienced the samekind of pains.</p><p>Still, however, it is equally well ascertained, that honiedwine prepared from this honey, when old, is altogether innoxious; and that there is nothing better than this honey, mixedwith costus,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> for softening the skin of females, or, combinedwith aloes, for the treatment of bruises.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This has been doubted by Spielmann, but it is nevertheless the truth;the nature of the sugar secreted by the glands of the nectary, being ana-logous to that of the plant which furnishes it. The honey gathered fromaconite in Switzerland has been known to produce vertigo and even delirium. Dr. Barton also gives a similar account of the effects of the poisonoushoney collected from the Kalmia latifolia in Pennsylvania; and GeoffroiSaint Hilaire says that, having eaten in Brazil some honey prepared by awasp called "lecheguana," his life was put in very considerable dangerthereby. Xenophon also speaks of the effects of the intoxicating or mad-dening honey upon some of the Ten Thousand in their retreat.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The rhododendrons and rose laurels, Fée says, which are so numerousin these parts, render the fact here stated extremely probable.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Goats' death." Fée says that this is the Rhododendron Ponticumof Linnæus. Desfontaines identifies it with the Azalea Pontica of modernbotany.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In reality, there are no visible signs by which to detect that the honeyis poisonous.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">B. xxix. c. 31.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. xii. c. 25.</p></body>
