<div2 type="chapter" n="3" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 3.–THE NATURE OF THE GRAPE, AND THE CULTIVATION OFTHE VINE.</head><p>The cultivated vine is kept down by pruning every year,and all the strength of the tree is drawn as much as possibleinto the shoots, or else thrown downwards to the sets;<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> indeed,it is only allowed to expand with the view of ensuring anabundant supply of juice, a result which is obtained in variousmodes according to the peculiarities of the climate and thenature of the soil. In Campania they attach<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> the vine to thepoplar: embracing the tree to which it is thus wedded, thevine grasps the branches with its amorous arms, and as itclimbs, holds on with its knotted trunk, till it has reached thevery summit; the height being sometimes so stupendous thatthe vintager when hired is wont to stipulate for his funeralpile and a grave at the owner's expense. The vine keeps<pb n="3219" />continually on the increase, and it is quite impossible to separate the two, or rather, I may say, to tear them asunder.Valerianus Cornelius has regarded it as one of the most remarkable facts that could be transmitted to posterity, thatsingle vines have been known to surround villas and country houses with their shoots and creeping tendrils ever on thestretch. At Rome, in the porticoes of Livia, a single vine,with its leaf-clad trellises, protects with its shade the walksin the open air; the fruit of it yields twelve amphoræ ofmust.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span></p><p>Everywhere we find the vine overtopping the elm even,and we read that Cineas,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> the ambassador of King Pyrrhus,when admiring the great height of the vines at Aricia,wittily making allusion to the peculiar rough taste of wine,remarked that it was with very good reason that they hadhung the parent of it on so lofty a gibbet. There is a treein that part of Italy which lies beyond the Padus,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> knownas the "rumpotinus,"<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> or sometimes by the name of "opulus," the broad circular<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> storeys of which are covered withvines, whose branches wind upwards in a serpentine form tothe part where the boughs finally divide,<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> and then, throwing out their tendrils, disperse them in every direction amongthe straight and finger-like twigs which project from thebranches. There are vines also, about as tall as a man ofmoderate height, which are supported by props, and, as theythrow out their bristling tendrils, form whole vineyards: whileothers, again, in their inordinate love for climbing, combinedwith skill on the part of the proprietor, will cover even thevery centre<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> of the court-yard with their shoots and foliage.<pb n="3220" />So numerous are the varieties of the vine which even Italyalone presents.</p><p>In some of the provinces the vine is able to stand of itselfwithout anything to support it, drawing in its bendingbranches, and making up in its thickness for its stunted size.In other places, again, the winds will not allow of this mode ofculture, as in Africa, for instance, and various parts of theprovince of Gallia Narbonensis. These vines, being preventedfrom growing beyond the first branches, and hence alwaysretaining a resemblance to those plants which stand in needof the hoe, trail along the ground just like them, and everyhere and there suck<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> up the juices from the earth to fill theirgrapes: it is in consequence of this, that in the interior of Africathe clusters<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> are known to exceed the body of an infant in size.The wine of no country is more acid than those of Africa, butthere is nowhere to be found a grape that is more agreeablefor its firmness, a circumstance which may very probably havegiven rise to its name of the "hard grape."<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> As to thevarieties of the grape, although they are rendered innumerableby the size, the colour, and the flavour of the berry, they aremultiplied even still more by the wines that they produce.In one part they are lustrous with a rich purple colour, whilein another, again, they glow with a rosy tint, or else are glossywith their verdant hue. The grapes that are merely whiteor black are the common sorts. The bumastus<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> swells outin form like a breast, while that known as the "dactylus,"<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>has a berry of remarkable length. Nature, too, displays suchvarieties in these productions of hers, that small grapes areoften to be found adhering to the largest vines, but of surpassing sweetness; they are known by the name of "leptorragæ."<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> Some, again, will keep throughout the winter, ifcare is taken to hang them to the ceiling<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span> with a string;<pb n="3221" />while others, again, will keep by virtue of their own naturalfreshness and vigour, if put into earthen jars, which are thenenclosed in dolia,<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> and covered up with the fermenting husksof grapes. Some grapes receive from the smoke of the blacksmith's forge that remarkable flavour which it is also knownto impart to wines: it was the high name of the EmperorTiberius that brought into such great repute the grapes thathad been smoked in the smithies of Africa. Before his timethe highest rank at table was assigned to the grapes of Rhætia,<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> and to those growing in the territory of Verona.</p><p>Raisins of the sun have the name of "passi," from havingbeen submitted<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> to the influence of the sun. It is not uncommon to preserve grapes in must, and so make them drunkwith their own juices; while there are some that are all thesweeter for being placed in must after it has been boiled;others, again, are left to hang on the parent tree till a newcrop has made its appearance, by which time they have become as clear and as transparent<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span> as glass. Astringentpitch, if poured upon the footstalk of the grape, will impartto it all that body and that firmness which, when placed indolia or amphoræ, it gives to wine. More recently, too, therehas been discovered a vine which produces a fruit that impartsto its wine a strong flavour of pitch: it is the famous grapethat confers such celebrity on the territory of Vienne,<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span> and ofwhich several varieties have recently enriched the territoriesof the Arverni, the Sequani, and the Helvii:<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span> it was unknown in the time of the poet Virgil, who has now been deadthese ninety years.<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span></p><p>In addition to these particulars, need I make mention of thefact that the vine<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span> has been introduced into the camp and<pb n="3222" />placed in the centurion's hand for the preservation of thesupreme authority and command? that this is the high rewardwhich summons the lagging ranks to the eagles raised aloft,<span id="ref_25"><a href="#note_25">[25]</a></span>and that even in chastisement for faults it tends to reflecthonour upon the punishment?<span id="ref_26"><a href="#note_26">[26]</a></span> It was the vineyard, too,that first afforded a notion,<span id="ref_27"><a href="#note_27">[27]</a></span> the practical utility of which hasbeen experienced in many a siege. Among the medicinal preparations, too, the vine holds so high a place, that its verywines taken by themselves are efficacious as remedies fordisease.<span id="ref_28"><a href="#note_28">[28]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "layers," "propagines."</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Nubunt, properly "marry."

Sillig suggests a newreading, which, unsupported as it is by any of the MSS., can only beregarded as fanciful, and perhaps as a very slight improvement on theattempts to obtain a solution of the difficulty. Pliny's main object seemsto be to contrast the vines that entwine round poles and rise perpendi-cularly with those that creep horizontally.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">By throwing out fresh shoots every here and there.
