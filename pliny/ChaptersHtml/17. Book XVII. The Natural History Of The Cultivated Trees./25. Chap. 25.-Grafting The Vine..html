<div2 type="chapter" n="25" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 25.ÑGRAFTING THE VINE.</head><p>Cato<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> speaks of three<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> methods of grafting the vine. Thefirst consists in piercing the stock to the pith, and then inserting the grafts, sharpened at the end, in manner already mentioned, care being taken to bring the pith of the two in contact. The second is adopted in case the two vines are nearone another, the sides of them both being cut in a slantingdirection where they face each other; after which the pith ofthe two trees is united by tying them together. In employing the third method, the vine is pierced obliquely to thepith, and grafts are inserted a couple of feet in length; theyare then tied down and covered over with prepared earth, carebeing taken to keep them in an upright position. In our<pb n="3483" />time, however, this method has been greatly improved bymaking use of the Gallic angler.<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> which pierces the tree with-out scorching it; it being the fact, that everything that burnsthe tree weakens its powers. Care, too, is taken to select agraft that is just beginning to germinate, and not to leavemore than a couple of the buds protruding from the stock.The vine, too, should be carefully bound with withes of elm,incisions being made in it on either side, in order that theslimy juices may exude through them in preference, whichare so particularly injurious to the vine. After this, whenthe graft has grown a couple of feet, the withe by which it isfastened should be cut, and the graft left to increase of its ownnatural vigour.</p><p>The proper time<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> for grafting the vine has been fixed asfrom the autumnal equinox to the beginning of the buddingseason. The cultivated plants are generally grafted on theroots of wild ones, where these last are of a drier nature. But ifa cultivated tree should be grafted on a wild one, it will verysoon degenerate and become wild.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> The rest depends entirelyon the weather. Dry weather is the best suited for grafting;an excellent remedy for any evil effects that may possibly becaused by the drought, being a few pots of earth placed nearthe stock and filled with ashes; through which a little wateris slowly filtered. Light dews are extremely favourable tografting by inoculation.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">De Re Rust. 41.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The first of these methods is now the only one at all employedwith the vine; indeed, it is more generally reproduced by means of layersand suckers.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is not accurately known what was the form or particular merit ofthis auger or wimble.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">FŽe remarks, that the period here named is very indefinite.
