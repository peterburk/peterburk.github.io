<div2 type="chapter" n="8" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 8. (8.)ÑCOUNTRIES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF AFRICA.</head><p>If we pass through the interior of Africa in a southerlydirection, beyond the G¾tuli, after having traversed theintervening deserts, we shall find, first of all the Liby-Egyptians<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span>, and then the country where the Leuc¾thio-<pb n="1404" />pians<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> dwell. Beyond<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> these are the Nigrit¾<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>, nations of®thiopia, so called from the river Nigris<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>, which has beenpreviously mentioned, the Gymnetes<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>, surnamed Pharusii,and, on the very margin of the ocean, the Perorsi<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>, whomwe have already spoken of as lying on the boundariesof Mauritania. After passing all these peoples, there arevast deserts towards the east until we come to the Garamantes,the Augyl¾, and the Troglodyt¾; the opinion ofthose being exceedingly well founded who place two ®thiopiasbeyond the deserts of Africa, and more particularlythat expressed by Homer<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>, who tells us that the ®thiopiansare divided into two nations, those of the east and those ofthe west. The river Nigris has the same characteristics asthe Nile; it produces the calamus, the papyrus, and justthe same animals, and it rises at the same seasons of theyear. Its source is between the Tarr¾lian ®thiopiansand the Îcalic¾. Magium, the city of the latter people,has been placed by some writers amid the deserts, and, next<pb n="1405" />to them the Atlantes; then the ®gipani, half men, halfbeasts, the Blemmy¾<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>, the Gamphasantes, the Satyri, andthe Himantopodes.</p><p>The Atlantes<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>, if we believe what is said, have lost allcharacteristics of humanity; for there is no mode of distinguishingeach other among them by names, and as they lookupon the rising and the setting sun, they give utterance todireful imprecations against it, as being deadly to themselvesand their lands; nor are they visited with dreams<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span>, likethe rest of mortals. The Troglodyt¾ make excavations inthe earth, which serve them for dwellings; the flesh of serpentsis their food; they have no articulate voice, butonly utter a kind of squeaking noise<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>; and thus are theyutterly destitute of all means of communication by language.The Garamantes have no institution of marriage amongthem, and live in promiscuous concubinage with theirwomen. The Augyl¾ worship no deities<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> but the gods of theinfernal regions. The Gamphasantes, who go naked, andare unacquainted with war<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span>, hold no intercourse whateverwith strangers. The Blemmy¾ are said to have no heads,<pb n="1406" />their mouths and eyes being seated in their breasts. TheSatyri<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>, beyond their figure, have nothing in common withthe manners of the human race, and the form of the ®gipani<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span>is such as is commonly represented in paintings. TheHimantopodes<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span> are a race of people with feet resemblingthongs, upon which they move along by nature with a serpentine,crawling kind of gait. The Pharusii, descendedfrom the ancient Persians, are said to have been the companionsof Hercules when on his expedition to the Hesperides.Beyond the above, I have met with nothing relative toAfrica<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span> worthy of mention.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The greater portion of this Chapter is extracted almost verbatim from the account given by Mela. Ptolemy seems to place the Liby-Egyptians to the south of the Greater and Lesser Oasis, on the route thence to Darfour.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "White ®thiopians," men though of dark complexion, not negroes. Marcus is of opinion that the words "intervenientibus desertis" refer to the tract of desert country lying between the Leuc¾thiopians and the Liby-Egyptians, and not to that between the G¾tulians on the one hand and the Liby-Egyptians and the Leuc¾thiopians on the other.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Meaning to the south and the south-east of these three nations, according to Marcus. Rennel takes the Leuc¾thiopians to be the present Mandingos of higher Senegambia: Marcus however thinks that they are the Azanaghis, who dwell on the edge of the Great Desert, and are not of so black a complexion as the Mandingos.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably the people of the present Nigritia or Soudan.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Marcus is of opinion that Pliny does not here refer to the Joliba of Park and other travellers, as other commentators have supposed; but that he speaks of the river called Zis by the modern geographers, and which Jackson speaks of as flowing from the south-east towards north-west. The whole subject of the Niger is however enwrapped in almost impenetrable obscurity, and as the most recent inquirers have not come to any conclusion on the subject, it would be little more than a waste of time and space to enter upon an investigation of the notions which Pliny and Mela entertained on the subject.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From <foreign lang="greek">gumno\s,</foreign> "naked."</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Mentioned in C. 1 of the present Book.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">7 He refers to the words in the Odyssey, B. i. l. 23, 24.Ñ<foreign lang="greek">Ai)qi/opas toi\ di/xqa dedaia/tai,</foreign> <foreign lang="greek">e)/sxatoi a)/ndrwn)</foreign><lb /><foreign lang="greek">Oi( me\n dusome/nou (Uperi/onos,</foreign> <foreign lang="greek">oi( d) a)nio/ntos.</foreign>"The ®hiopians, the most remote of mankind, are divided into twoparts, the one at the setting of Hyperion, the other at his rising."</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A tribe of ®thiopia, whose position varied considerably at different epochs of history. Their predatory and savage habits caused the most extraordinary reports to be spread of their appearance and ferocity. The more ancient geographers bring them as far westward as the region beyond the Libyan Desert, and into the vicinity of the Oases. In the time however of the Antonines, when Ptolemy was composing his description of Africa, they appear to the south and east of Egypt, in the wide and almost unknown tract which lay between the rivers Astapus and Astobores.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Mela speaks of this race as situate farthest to the west. The description of them here given is from Herodotus, B. iv. c. 183Ð185, who speaks of them under the name of "Atarantes."</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The people who are visited by no dreams, are called Atlantes by Herodotus, the same name by which Pliny calls them. He says that their territory is ten days' journey from that of the Atarantes.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This also is borrowed from Herodotus. As some confirmation of this account, it is worthy of remark, that the Rock Tibboos of the present day, who, like the ancient Troglodyt¾, dwell in caves, have so peculiar a kind of speech, that it is compared by the people of Aujelah to nothing but the whistling of birds. The Troglodyt¾ of Fezzan are here referred to, not those of the coasts of the Red Sea.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Mela says that they look upon the Manes or spirits of the departed as their only deities.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This is said, in almost the same words, of the Garamantes, by Herodotus. The mistake was probably made by Mela in copying from Herodotus, and continued by Pliny when borrowing from him.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">So called from their supposed resemblance in form to the Satyrs of the ancient mythology, who were represented as little hairy men with horns, long ears, and tails. They were probably monkeys, which had been mistaken for men.</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Half goat, half man. See the Note relative to ®gipan, in C. 1 of the present Book, p. 378.</p><p><span id="note_17"><a href="#ref_17">17. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Evidently intended to be derived from the Greek <foreign lang="greek">i(ma\s</foreign> "a thong," and <foreign lang="greek">po/des</foreign> "the feet." It is most probable that the name of a savage people in the interior bore a fancied resemblance to this word, upon which the marvellous story here stated was coined for the purpose of tallying with the name. From a statement in the ®thiopica of Heliodorus, B. x., Marcus suggests that the story as to the Blemmyee having no heads arose from the circumstance, that on the invasion of the Persians they were in the habit of falling on one knee and bowing the head to the breast, by which means, without injury to themselves, they afforded a passage to the horses of the enemy.</p><p><span id="note_18"><a href="#ref_18">18. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It must be remembered, as already mentioned, that the ancients looked upon Egypt as forming part of Asia, not of Africa. It seems impossible to say how this supposition arose, when the Red Sea and the Isthmus of Suez form so natural and so palpable a frontier between Asia and Africa.</p></body>
