It isof a crystalline formation, of a lustrous azure colour, and is anative of Carmania. Zenothemis admits that it is white, butasserts that it has the figure of a blazing star within. Some ofthem, he says, are dull, in which case it is the custom to steepthem for some days in a mixture of nitre and vinegar; at theend of which period the star makes its appearance, but graduallydies away by the end of as many months.</p><p>Sotacus mentions also two other varieties of ceraunia, oneblack and the other red; and he says that they resemble axesin shape. Those which are black and round,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> he says, arelooked upon as sacred, and by their assistance cities and fleetsare attacked and taken: the name given to them is "bætyli,"those of an elongated form being known as "cerauniæ."<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> Theymake out also that there is another kind, rarely to be met with,and much in request for the practices of magic, it never beingfound in any place but one that has been struck by lightning.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See Note 8 above.

The reading "bætyli" is doubtful; but Parisotsays, on what authority does not appear, that "Betylus" meant "Greatfather," and that this name, as well as "Abaddir" of similar signification,was given by magicians to aërolites or meteorites used in their enohantments.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">A meteoric stone or aërolite, evidently.</p></body>
