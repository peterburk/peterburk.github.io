It is prolific, buthas a straw of remarkable thinness; it is also black andsombre-looking, but weighs extremely heavy. Spelt is mixedwith this grain to modify its bitterness,<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and even then it isvery disagreeable to the stomach. It will grow upon any soil,and yields a hundred-fold; it is employed also as a manurefor enriching the land.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably the Secale cereale of Linna¾us, cultivated rye.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is now held in high esteem in many parts of Europe.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Rye has no bitterness, and this assertion has led some to doubt if it isidentical with the "secale" of Pliny.</p></body>
