(48.)ÑTHE FEET OF ANIMALS, FROM THOSE HAVINGTWO FEET TO THOSE WITH A HUNDRED.ÑDWARFS.</head><p>Among insects, those which have hard eyes have the forefeet long, in order that from time to time they may rub theeyes with their feet, as we frequently see done by flies. Theinsects which have long hind-feet are able to leap, the locust,for instance. All these insects have six feet: and some of thespiders have two very long feet in addition. They have, allof them, three joints. We have already"<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> stated that marineinsects have eight feet, such as the polypus, the s¾pia, thecuttle-fish, and the crab, animals which move their arms in acontrary direction to their feet, which last they move aroundas well as obliquely: they are the only animals the feet ofwhich have a rounded form. Other insects have two feet toregulate their movements; in the crab, and in that only, theseduties are performed by four. The land animals which exceedthis number of feet, as most of the worms,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> never have fewerthan twelve feet, and some, indeed, as many as a hundred.The number of feet is never uneven in any animal. Amongthe solid-hoofed animals, the legs are of their proper lengthfrom the moment of their birth, after which they may withmore propriety be said to extend themselves than to increasein growth: hence it is, that in infancy they are able to scratchtheir ears with the hind feet, a thing which, when they growolder, they are not able to do, because their increase of growthaffects only the superficies of the body. It is for the samereason also, that they are only able to graze at first by bendingthe knees, until such time as the neck has attained its properlength.</p><p>(49.) There are dwarfs to be found among all animals, andamong birds even.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">B. ix. c. 44.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">He evidently means insects of the centipede class.
