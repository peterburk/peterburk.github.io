<div2 type="chapter" n="12" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 12. (13).—TWELVE KINDS OF PLUMS.</head><p>Next comes a vast number of varieties of the plum, theparti-coloured, the black,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> the white,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> the barley<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> plum—so called, because it is ripe at barley-harvest—and another ofthe same colour as the last, but which ripens later, and is of alarger size, generally known as the "asinina,"<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> from the littleesteem in which it is held. There are the onychina, too, the<pb n="3295" />cerina,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>—more esteemed, and the purple<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> plum: the Armenian,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> also an exotic from foreign parts, the only one among theplums that recommends itself by its smell. The plum-treegrafted on the nut exhibits what we may call a piece of impudence quite its own, for it produces a fruit that has all the appearance of the parent stock, together with the juice of theadopted fruit: in consequence of its being thus compounded ofboth, it is known by the name of "nuci-pruna."<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> Nut-prunes,as well as the peach, the wild plum,<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span> and the cerina, are oftenput in casks, and so kept till the crop comes of the followingyear. All the other varieties ripen with the greatest rapidity,and pass off just as quickly. More recently, in Bætica, they havebegun to introduce what they call "malina," or the fruit ofthe plum engrafted on the apple-tree,<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span> and "amygdalina," thefruit of the plum engrafted on the almond-tree,<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> the kernelfound in the stone of these last being that of the almond;<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span> indeed, there is no specimen in which two fruits have been moreingeniously combined in one.</p><p>Among the foreign trees we have already spoken<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span> of theDamascene<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> plum, so called from Damascus, in Syria, butintroduced long since into Italy; though the stone of this plumis larger than usual, and the flesh smaller in quantity. Thisplum will never dry so far as to wrinkle; to effect that, itneeds the sun of its own native country. The myxa,<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span> too,<pb n="3296" />may be mentioned, as being the fellow-countryman of theDamascene: it has of late been introduced into Rome, andhas been grown engrafted upon the sorb.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Perhaps the Prunus ungarica of naturalists, the black damask plum;or else the Prunus perdrigona, the perdrigon.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably the Prunus galatensis of naturalists.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Hordearia:" the Prunus præcox of naturalists; probably ourharvest plum.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "ass"-plum.

It grows only inSyria and Egypt; and hence Fée is inclined to reject what Pliny says asto its naturalization at Rome, and the account he gives as to its being engrafted on the sorb.</p></body>
