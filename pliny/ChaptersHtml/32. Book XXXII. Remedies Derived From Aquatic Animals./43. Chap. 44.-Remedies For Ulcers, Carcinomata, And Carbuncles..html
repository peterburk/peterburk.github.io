<div2 type="chapter" n="44" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 44.—REMEDIES FOR ULCERS, CARCINOMATA, AND CARBUNCLES.</head><p>Ulcers of a serpiginous nature, as also the fleshy excrescenceswhich make their appearance in them, are kept in check byapplying ashes of calcined heads of mænæ,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> or else ashes ofthe silurus.<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> Carcinomata, too, are treated with heads ofsalted perch, their efficacy being considerably increased byusing some salt along with the ashes, and kneading them upwith heads of cunila<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> and olive-oil. Ashes of sea-crabs, calcinedwith lead, arrest the progress of carcinomatous sores: apurpose for which ashes of river-crabs, in combination withhoney and fine lint, are equally useful; though there are someauthorities which prefer mixing alum and barley with theashes. Phagedænic ulcers are cured by an application ofdried silurus pounded with sandarach;<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> malignant cancers,corrosive ulcers, and putrid sores, by the agency of stalecybium.<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span></p><p>Maggots that breed in sores are removed by applying frogs'gall; and fistulas are opened and dried by introducing a tentmade of salt fish, with a dossil of lint. Salt fish, kneaded upand applied in the form of a plaster, will remove all proudflesh in the course of a day, and will arrest the further progressof putrid and serpiginous ulcers. Alex,<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> applied inlint, acts detergently, also, upon ulcers; the same, too, with theashes of calcined shells of sea-urchins. Salted slices of thecoracinus<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> disperse carbuncles, an effect equally produced bythe ashes of salted surmullets.<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span> Some persons, however, use<pb n="6053" />the head only of the surmullet, in combination with honeyor with the flesh of the coracinus. Ashes of the murex, appliedwith oil, disperse tumours, and the gall of the sea-scorpionmakes scars disappear.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See B. ix. c. 42.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">See Note 55 above.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">"Cunila capitata."
