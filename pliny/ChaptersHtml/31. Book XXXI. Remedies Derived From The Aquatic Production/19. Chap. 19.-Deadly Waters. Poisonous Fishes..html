POISONOUS FISHES.</head><p>There are other marvels again, connected with water, but of<pb n="5481" />a more fatal nature. Ctesias states in his writings, that thereis a spring in Armenia, the fishes in which are black,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> and, ifused as food, productive of instantaneous death. I have heardthe same, too, with reference to the waters near the sourcesof the river Danuvius,<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> until a spring is reached which isnear its main channel, and beyond which this poisonous kindof fish is not to be found. Hence it is that this spot is generally looked upon as the source of the river. The same, too, isreported of the Lake of the Nymphs, in Lydia. Near the riverPheneus, in Achaia, there flows from the rocks a spring knownas the Styx, the waters of which, as already<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> stated, are instantly fatal. And not only this, but there are also small fishin it, Theophrastus says, which are as deadly as the water,a thing that is not the case with the fish of any other poisonous springs. Theopompus says, that at the town of Cychri,in Thrace, the waters are deadly; and Lycus states, that atLeontium<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> there is a spring, the waters of which are fatal atthe end of a couple of days to those who drink thereof. Varrospeaks also of a spring upon Mount Soracte, some four feet inbreadth, the waters of which bubble forth at sunrise, as thoughthey were boiling; birds, he says, which only taste thereof,fall dead close by.</p><p>And then, besides, we meet with this insidious circumstance,that in some cases, waters of this nature are inviting even intheir appearance; those at Nonacris, in Arcadia, for example,the water of which fountain possesses no apparent quality toexcite mistrust, though, owing to its intense coldness, it isgenerally looked upon as highly injurious, seeing that it petrifies as it flows. It is otherwise with the waters of Tempe,in Thessaly, their baneful properties inspiring universal terror,and possessing the property of corroding copper even andiron, it is said. This stream runs a short distance only, asalready stated;<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> and it is truly marvellous that, accordingto general report, the banks of its source<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> are surrounded withthe roots of a wild carob,<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span> always covered with purple flowers,<pb n="5482" />while the margin is clothed with a green herbaceous plant ofa peculiar species. In Macedonia, not far from the tomb ofthe Poet Euripides, is the confluence of two streams, the waterof one of which is extremely wholesome, that of the otherfatal.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ajasson thinks that he means, grey.
