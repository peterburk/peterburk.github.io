<div2 type="chapter" n="75" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head>CHAP. 75.—TE OPINION OF CATO ON THE FELLING OF TIMBER.</head><p>Cato,<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> a man of consummate authority in all practical matters, expresses himself in relation to timber to the followingeffect:—"For making presses, employ the wood of the sappinusin preference. When you root up the elm, the pine, the nut-<pb n="3417" />tree, or, indeed, any other kind of tree, mind and do so whenthe moon is on the wane, after midday, and when there is nosouth wind blowing. The proper time for cutting a tree iswhen the seed<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> is ripe, but be careful not to draw it away orplane it while the dew is falling." He then proceeds to say<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>—" Never touch the timber, except when the moon is on thechange, or else at the end of the second quarter: at thoseperiods you may either root up the tree, or fell it as it stands.The next seven days after the full moon are the best of all forgrubbing up a tree. Be particularly careful, too, not to rough-hew timber, or, indeed, to cut or touch it, unless it is perfectlydry; and by no means while it is covered with frost or dew."</p><p>The Emperor Tiberius used also to observe the changes ofthe moon for cutting his hair.<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> M. Varro<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> has recommendedthat the hair should be cut at full moon only, if we wouldavoid baldness.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">De Re Rust. c. 31; also cc. 17 and 37.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">This practice is observed in modern times.</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">C. 37.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pliny, no doubt, observes an analogy between the hair of the humanhead, and trees as forming the hair of the earth.
