This plant is repro-duced from a tear-like gum<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span> which exudes from the stem: itis also grown from the roots as well. Those whose businessit is to collect the juice of it, say that it has just the flavour ofmyrrh; and, according to Theophrastus,<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span> it is obtained byplanting myrrh. The ancients recommended that hipposelinumshould be grown in uncultivated spots covered with stones,and in the vicinity of garden walls; but at the present day itis sown in ground that has been twice turned up, between the prevalence of the west winds and the autumnal equinox.</p><p>The caper,<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span> too, should be sown in dry localities more particularly, the plot being hollowed out and surrounded with anembankment of stones erected around it: it this precaution isnot taken, it will spread all over the adjoining land, and entailsterility upon the soil. The caper blossoms in summer, andretains its verdure till the setting of the Vergiliæ; it thrivesthe best of all in a sandy soil. As to the bad qualities of thecaper which grows in the parts beyond the sea, we havealready<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span> enlarged upon them when speaking of the exoticshrubs.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "black-herb:" the herb Alexander, the Smyrnium olusatrun, ofLinnæus.
