This plant, also, is plucked along withthe root, and is carefully pressed together with the hands; forit very soon becomes brittle. That kind is held in the highestesteem, the leaves of which bear a strong resemblance to thoseof the pomegranate, being free from wrinkles, and of a redcolour. The second quality is that which is of a pallid hue.That which has a green, grassy appearance, is not so good,and the white is the worst of all; it assumes this appearancewhen old. The price of clustered amomum is sixty denarii perpound, but in dust it sells at only forty-nine. Amomum is produced, also, in that part of Armenia which is known as Otene;as, also, in Media and Pontus. It is adulterated with the leavesof the pomegranate and a solution of gum, which is employed<pb n="3123" />in order to make the leaves adhere and form clusters, likethose of the grape.</p><p>There is another substance, also, which is known by thename of amomis;<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span> it is not so full of veins as amomum,harder, and not so odoriferous; from which it would appear,either that it is altogether a different plant, or else that it isamomum gathered in an unripe state.</p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It is by no means settled among naturalists, what plant the Amomumof the ancients was; indeed, there has been the greatest divergence ofopinion. Tragus takes it to be a kind of bindweed: Matthioli, the Piper®thiopicum of Linn¾us: Cordus and Scaliger, the rose of Jericho, theAnastatica hierocuntica of Linn¾us. Gesner thinks it to have been thegarden pepper, the Solanum bacciferum of Tournefort: C¾salpinus thecubeb, the Piper cubeba of Linn¾us: Plukenet and Sprengel the Cissusvitiginea, while FŽe and Paulet look upon it as not improbably identicalwith the Amomum racemosum of Linn¾us. The name is probably derivedfrom the Arabic hahm‰ma, the Arabians having first introduced it to thenotice of the Greeks.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Supposed to have been only the Amomum, in an unripe state, as Plinyhimself suggests.</p></body>
