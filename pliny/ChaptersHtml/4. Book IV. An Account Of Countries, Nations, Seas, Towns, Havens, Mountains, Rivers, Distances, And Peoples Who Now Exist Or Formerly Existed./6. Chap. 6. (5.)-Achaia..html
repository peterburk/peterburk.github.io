(5.)—ACHAIA.</head><p>The province called Achaia<span id="ref_1"><a href="#note_1">[1]</a></span> begins at the Isthmus; fromthe circumstance of its cities being ranged in regular succession onits coast, it formerly had the name of Ægialos<span id="ref_2"><a href="#note_2">[2]</a></span>.The first place there is Lecheæ, already mentioned, a port ofthe Corinthians; next to which is Olyros<span id="ref_3"><a href="#note_3">[3]</a></span>, a fortress of thepeople of Pellene<span id="ref_4"><a href="#note_4">[4]</a></span>; then the former towns of Helice andBura<span id="ref_5"><a href="#note_5">[5]</a></span>, and the places in which their inhabitants took refugeafter their towns had been swallowed up by the sea, Sicyon<span id="ref_6"><a href="#note_6">[6]</a></span>namely, Ægira<span id="ref_7"><a href="#note_7">[7]</a></span>, Ægium, and Erineos<span id="ref_8"><a href="#note_8">[8]</a></span>. In the interior areCleonæ and Hysiæ<span id="ref_9"><a href="#note_9">[9]</a></span>; then come the port of Panormus<span id="ref_10"><a href="#note_10">[10]</a></span>, andRhium already mentioned; from which promontory, Patræ,of which we have previously spoken, is distant five miles; andthen the place where Pheræ<span id="ref_11"><a href="#note_11">[11]</a></span> stood. Of the nine mountainsof Achaia, Scioessa is the most famous; there is also theFountain of Cymothoë. Beyond Patræ we find the town ofOlenum<span id="ref_12"><a href="#note_12">[12]</a></span>, the colony of Dyme<span id="ref_13"><a href="#note_13">[13]</a></span>, the places where Bupra-<pb n="1281" />sium<span id="ref_14"><a href="#note_14">[14]</a></span> and Hyrmine once stood, the Promontory of Araxus<span id="ref_15"><a href="#note_15">[15]</a></span>,the Bay of Cyllene, and the Promontory of Chelonates, at fivemiles' distance from Cyllene<span id="ref_16"><a href="#note_16">[16]</a></span>. There is also the fortress ofPhlius<span id="ref_17"><a href="#note_17">[17]</a></span>; the district around which was called by HomerAræthyrea<span id="ref_18"><a href="#note_18">[18]</a></span>, and, after his time, Asopis.</p><p>The territory of the Eleans then begins, who were formerlycalled Epei, with the city of Elis<span id="ref_19"><a href="#note_19">[19]</a></span> in the interior, and, at adistance of twelve miles from Phlius, being also in the interior, thetemple of Olympian Jupiter, which by the universal celebrity of itsgames, gives to Greece its mode ofreckoning<span id="ref_20"><a href="#note_20">[20]</a></span>. Here too once stood the town of Pisa<span id="ref_21"><a href="#note_21">[21]</a></span>, the riverAlpheus flowing past it. On the coast there is the Promontory ofIchthys<span id="ref_22"><a href="#note_22">[22]</a></span>. The river Alpheus is navigable six miles,nearly as far as the towns of Aulon<span id="ref_23"><a href="#note_23">[23]</a></span> and Leprion. We nextcome to the Promontory of Platanodes<span id="ref_24"><a href="#note_24">[24]</a></span>. All these localitieslie to the west.<pb n="1282" /></p></div2><p><span id="note_1"><a href="#ref_1">1. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Originally a district in the south of Thessaly had this name; but todistinguish it from that in the Peloponnesus, its people were called thePhthiotian Achæi.</p><p><span id="note_2"><a href="#ref_2">2. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">From the Greek word <foreign lang="greek">ai)gialo\s,</foreign> "the sea-shore."</p><p><span id="note_3"><a href="#ref_3">3. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Situate on the coast, about five miles from the present Vostitza.</p><p><span id="note_4"><a href="#ref_4">4. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">In the interior. The modern Trikala stands on its site.</p><p><span id="note_5"><a href="#ref_5">5. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Helice was the place of meeting of the Achæan league; when, inB.C. <date value="-373" authname="-373">373</date>, together with Bura, it was swallowed up by anearthquake, andtheir sites were covered by the sea. Such of the people as escaped fled tothe places mentioned above by Pliny. Pouqueville says that some remainsof these places may still be seen emerging from the sea.</p><p><span id="note_6"><a href="#ref_6">6. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The modern Basilico or Vasilika stands on its site.</p><p><span id="note_7"><a href="#ref_7">7. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The places called Paleo-Kastro and Vostitza are supposed tooccupy the sites of Ægira and Ægium. To the east of Vostitzaconsiderable ruins are still to be seen.</p><p><span id="note_8"><a href="#ref_8">8. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Supposed to be the present Artotina.</p><p><span id="note_9"><a href="#ref_9">9. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Towns of Roman Argolis. The ruins of the former are supposed tobe those at a spot still called Klenes, near the village of Curtesi. Theremains of Hysieæ, on the road from Argos to Tegea, stand on a hillabove the plain of Achladokampos.</p><p><span id="note_10"><a href="#ref_10">10. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now called Tekieh; fifteen stadia from Rhium.</p><p><span id="note_11"><a href="#ref_11">11. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or Pharæ; 150 stadia from Patre.</p><p><span id="note_12"><a href="#ref_12">12. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The modern Kato-Achaia.</p><p><span id="note_13"><a href="#ref_13">13. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Its remains are to be seen near the modern village of Karavostasi.Pliny is mistaken probably in calling it a colony, as we know that it wasplaced under the authority of the colony of Patræ, which alone wasallowed to enjoy the privilege of self-government.</p><p><span id="note_14"><a href="#ref_14">14. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Pouqueville thinks that it was situate on the river now called theVerga. Leake supposes that the town of Hyrmine stood on the site ofthe present Kastro Tornese on the peninsula of Khlemutzi; but Boblayeand Curtius place it further north, at the modern harbour of Kunupeli,where there are some ancient ruins.</p><p><span id="note_15"><a href="#ref_15">15. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Now Capo Papa.</p><p><span id="note_16"><a href="#ref_16">16. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">The locality of Cyllene is doubtful. Most writers place it atGlarentza, but Pouqueville suggests Andravida or Andravilla, andMannertplaces it near Clarenza. Chelinates or Chelonatas was probably thename originally of the whole peninsula of Khlemutzi, but the point herementioned was most probably the modern Cape Tornese.</p><p><span id="note_17"><a href="#ref_17">17. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It lay in the interior, south of Sicyonia, and north of Argos.Pouqueville found its ruins on the banks of the Asopus.</p><p><span id="note_18"><a href="#ref_18">18. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Strabo says that this was the name of the most ancient town ofPhliasia, and that the inhabitants afterwards deserted it for Phlius.</p><p><span id="note_19"><a href="#ref_19">19. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Some small ruins of it are to be seen at the foot of the hill ofKaloskopi, its ancient Acropolis.</p><p><span id="note_20"><a href="#ref_20">20. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">By Olympiads, which were reckoned according to the order ofcelebration of the Olympic games: they were established in the yearB.C. <date value="-776" authname="-776">776</date>,and were celebrated every fourth year.</p><p><span id="note_21"><a href="#ref_21">21. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">It was destroyed in the year B.C. <date value="-572" authname="-572">572</date> by the Eleans, not a vestigeof it being left. The Alpheus retains the name of Alfio.</p><p><span id="note_22"><a href="#ref_22">22. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or "the Fish," from its peculiar shape. It is now called Katakolo.</p><p><span id="note_23"><a href="#ref_23">23. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Probably situate in the valley between Elis and Messenia, which wasso called. It is not elsewhere mentioned; and its ruins are thought tobe those near the sea, on the right bank of the river Cyparissus. Leprionis again mentioned in c. x.</p><p><span id="note_24"><a href="#ref_24">24. </a></span><note anchored="yes" place="foot">Or Platamodes. Supposed to be the present Aja Kyriaki.</p></body>
